[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.900]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.100]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.300]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.300]   How lovely to see you today.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hot-knowing wind.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.100]   Yeah, I just noticed that I'm very, very glowy.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.700]   I might-- maybe just for summer months,
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.900]   I might need to get some foundation or some sort of powder
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.500]   because I look very glowy.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.000]   Adam angst, apparently, is big on the sunscreen
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   on the other hand because--
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.400]   I won the worst tan on the track and trust me.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.000]   In three years running in high school.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.200]   And I know you're a runner, so you really must slather up.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   Yeah, well, this is what I look like sunscreen--
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.500]   well, actually, if I don't do the sunscreen,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   then I just look red.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000]   So it's a different story.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.800]   Very fair.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   And a wonderful journalist covering the Mac longer
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.400]   than anybody at tidbits.com, the longest running Apple newsletter.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.700]   And I'm really thrilled to get Daniel Jowkut on this show.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.600]   Am I saying your name, right?
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.300]   I've never said it out loud.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.500]   Yeah, it is perfect.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.300]   You're saying it perfectly.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400]   And I remind you, Leo, you've said it out loud
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.200]   because I was just looking at the history books here.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.800]   And I've been on this show almost eight years ago.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.500]   That's great to be back.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.800]   Every eight years, Daniel, whether you're ready or not,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.300]   we're bringing you back.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300]   Don't look at Daniel.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.700]   How amazing how long the show's been running.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.200]   Ah, yeah, we're in our 11th year now.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.000]   Daniel is with Red Sweater software.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.600]   He's a software developer, one of the best.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.800]   And I think I always want to get you on the show
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.400]   whenever we have developer.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.600]   You know, we talk about the app store and things like that
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.900]   because you're very outspoken, but you're also, I think, very fair.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.900]   And you represent the developer community,
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   the Mac developer community quite well.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.400]   Quite well.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.500]   Well, I do try to.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   Mars edit.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.600]   I use it all the time to write while I used to.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.900]   I guess Squarespace doesn't have an API, huh?
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.700]   No, they don't.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.600]   That's an unfortunate progression, in my opinion.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.300]   But that's just the choice they made.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.700]   And it seems to be working OK for them.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.300]   Yeah, you can email.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.800]   I do sometimes and then of course they have their own interface,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.400]   but I and they have their own software.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.300]   But I loved using Mars edit.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.100]   It was the easiest way to post a WordPress ever.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.100]   Thank you.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.900]   Mars edit and acorn was like, I thought the kind of the perfect
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.500]   blogging platform.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.900]   Also, black ink.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.100]   Black ink I did not know about.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.400]   Is this relatively new or am I just behind?
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.200]   Black ink is pretty old by now.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.400]   This actually I if you think back, you probably remember,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.900]   I acquired Mars edit from Brent Simmons who originally
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.800]   developed it and it was around within a month or so of that.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.100]   I had made this kind of like quip on my blog because I was
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.600]   offended by somebody who had sold somebody some software
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.200]   or and I don't know.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   I forget the details, but there was like a raw deal somebody got.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.600]   So I said, I'll I'll buy somebody software who wants to sell
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400]   it for $5,000 and black ink is what came.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   Oh, funny.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.500]   So it was kind of like a wheeling and dealing thing, but I took
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.600]   this this old app called Mac X word and sort of gave it my
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.900]   my polishing up and try to turn it into the kind of Mac app
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.700]   that I thought it should be.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.700]   I'm glad you're I'm glad you're keeping it around because I'm
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.400]   a crossword puzzle fanatic.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.100]   Oh good.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.300]   And then before this and I guess you don't do it anymore.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.400]   You had a notebook program, right?
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.800]   No, I'm not a notebook program.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.000]   You might be mixing me up with Gus Mueller of Acorn fame again.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.300]   And what did well before you did these?
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.400]   I have a couple other apps.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.300]   I still keep around.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.400]   One of them is called flex time.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   OK, you did use that.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.900]   You gave that a spin because I tried to present that.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.400]   I think that might be how we got to know each other.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.600]   Maybe.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   I suggested it as something to help with your your queue timing.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.600]   Right.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.700]   Oh, that's right.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   That's that's right.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.100]   Yes.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.800]   I remember now.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.300]   Yes.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.500]   OK.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.900]   And then I and then I have a fat an Apple script utility called fast
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.700]   which I have used for years.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   And that's just kind of sits up in the menu bar.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.100]   Right.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.300]   And and just about rounds it out.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.600]   And you miss clarion.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.400]   Oh, clarion.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.300]   Of course, clarion.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's that's my oldest app up there.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.300]   I think that app is probably.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.700]   20 years old now.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.500]   What if not more?
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.000]   Is this really for power PC?
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.600]   It was originally written in in carbon carbon.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.700]   So nice.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.800]   God, we've been a max been around for a while.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.400]   If carbon is 20 years old.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.900]   Wow.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.800]   Right.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.600]   I think there are too few apps out today that have that brushed steel
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.100]   appearance.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.400]   Bring it back.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   What was wrong?
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.500]   Fuck with you.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   You don't put any you don't put any of your apps on the app store.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.900]   Do you.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.300]   I actually do.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.200]   I'm even though I'm pretty outspoken about the app store.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.900]   I try to be somewhat of a reasonable business person.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.600]   So when the app store came out for the Mac, I just I jumped on it and I have to admit it really did.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.200]   It helped my sales a lot.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:05.100]   So not everybody has had that experience, but in my case, at least when the app store came out, it was not quite, but approaching like a doubling in sales.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.300]   So I was very welcome.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:14.000]   And it really seemed at that point, at least to be bringing in customers who wouldn't have otherwise discovered the software.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:26.400]   So there's a lot there's a lot to talk about with the app store as far as things that you know, I wish were different, but I mean, at that time, at least, and you know, I keep my stuff in there to this day, the stuff that's qualified.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.000]   You know, so something like fast scripts is funny.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.200]   It's in there, but it would never be qualified to be in the app store today.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.700]   There's a sort of grandfathering of stuff that is not sandboxed and can't be sandboxed.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.600]   But you know, it's nice.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:53.400]   I get, you know, I get I get now still a fair amount of sales through the app store and I keep my regular store open to just kind of have that flexibility to not put all my eggs in one basket.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.300]   Well, one of the reasons you're here is because we've been having this conversation.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:10.400]   Last week, of course, there was a lot of conversation about Apple and, you know, then they're 30% and companies that didn't want to pay Apple the 30% most notably.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.000]   Who was it?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.400]   I can't spotify.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:22.900]   And, you know, we posited, but not being developers didn't know, but we posited that it's one thing for a company like Spotify, which has almost no margin.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.700]   If actually negative margin to pay to hand over 30% to Apple.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.600]   It's another thing for a software developer.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:39.000]   And I think we, the, you know, include in reporters thought that that was a pretty good deal for software.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.400]   So, but I know you've also been, you know, critical of the app store.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.000]   So we thought we should get somebody who actually use the app store on.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.300]   Pretty sense, pretty high.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.600]   Is it too high?
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.800]   Is it too high?
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.400]   I guess Adam, you have some apps there too.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:59.600]   Well, not so much apps, but we deal with the I book store and do a lot of selling of take, you know, our take control books on our own and through various carts and services.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.100]   And yeah, 30% is really high.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah, but that's again, that's not the same as so.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.500]   So there's software.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.000]   There's publications, books, subscriptions, and then there's, you know, music.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.800]   Definitely I could see why Spotify wouldn't want to do it or maybe, you know, Amazon or.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.900]   But, but a Netflix, but I can also feel like if you're developing software.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:29.100]   It you get the bonus of, you know, people feel comfortable with it and you don't have to put it in a box.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.300]   You don't have to ship it to a store.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   You don't have a middleman.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.900]   I mean, you had.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:43.100]   I think it comes down to discoverability that if you believe the app store is going to provide you with more customers who you could not reach otherwise than it's worth doing and it's worth taking that 30% here.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.200]   I mean, we'll we'll give out 30% coupons to acquire a new customer, pretty happily.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:10:03.100]   But if you're selling to your own audience, you can drop that 30% to, you know, 3% or 5% so easily that it just doesn't make financial sense to have your primary work going through Apple.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:10.300]   If you can handle the rest of the store stuff on your own using someone like fast spring or accelerate or, you know, one of the digital river companies.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.000]   It isn't like the days when you had to go to a distributor.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.600]   No one's doing business sales anymore, basically at all.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   You know, that the number of people do it putting stuff in boxes.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.100]   And I mean, remember the end caps?
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.100]   Remember the Mac connection catalogs?
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.500]   I loved Mac connection catalogs.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.700]   And but yeah, that days those days are long, long on.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.800]   So, Daniel, you feel it's a good deal, but now it's interesting because you have experience in both ends because you also sell direct.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:51.400]   Well, I think just to add to what Adam was saying, it's sort of it's right in the middle of, I think, where people who are used to paying, you know, 3% credit card processing fees and then, you know, whatever the nominal costs of, you know, having a website at all.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.900]   They're likely to see it as not a great deal.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:06.100]   If you just look at the numbers alone and then people who are used to, you know, putting software on CD-ROMs and putting them in boxes and then having distributors and maybe hopefully getting 40% of the final cut.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.200]   I don't know. I don't even know exactly what it would be.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.300]   Yeah, I think that 40 is probably right, right?
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:18.200]   And then it looks pretty great that you get to suddenly keep 70% through the app store and get, you know, have them take care of all the mechanics of it.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:32.400]   But I think more and more, I think just what people are observing is you can't really compare it to what the way things used to be because obviously we're all enjoying these efficiencies of the Internet and the fact that we don't have the boxes.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.500]   We don't have the CD-ROMs.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.700]   So it's kind of a pointless comparison to compare it to time when things just were more expensive to make and distribute.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:49.900]   And I think what many developers myself included, even if I think it's a fair deal or not putting aside whether I think it's a fair deal, even if it's a deal I'm willing to be part of.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:12:00.800]   You can still look at it and say, wait a minute, you know, this Apple, the richest company in the world, you know, really need to be taking 30%.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.400]   I mean, I'd be really curious to know how much it actually costs them.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   They obviously give a lot to folks who, for example, are hosting like gigabyte worth of data per download.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:23.800]   Maybe they're getting a better deal from Apple Store for that than somebody who's selling, you know, an app that happens to be 500k or something.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.100]   But it just seems like most people can look at it and say, well,
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.000]   you know, can Apple get by like charging 0%?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.100]   No, can they get by charging 10%?
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.900]   Probably.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.300]   Can they do 20% seems like definitely.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:50.800]   And so it just becomes a question of like, when will Apple sort of decide that on balance, it's better to support the community, to support the developers who are adding value to the platform.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:58.900]   And if they can do like, say 20%, they without, you know, batting an eye and it would help the developer community.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.900]   Why not do that just to sort of invest in their own developer base?
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.600]   Yeah, big one.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:18.900]   I mean, I think the other side of it, I mean, when you look back at the way software was historically sold, I mean, aside from the fact that you have all of the distribution in city, Ram and blah, blah, blah, is the prices were also a lot higher.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:25.600]   So, you know, you software was $99, $150, $49, you know, the big stuff, $4.99.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.200]   And for the most part, those software prices have also been driven through the floor.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.900]   So that 30% is only part of the whole change that's come about as we switch from a physical model to an electronic model.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.900]   And, you know, I mean, obviously, if that's in the Mac App Store, it's one thing.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:50.800]   You can look at the iOS App Store and, you know, prices are, you know, most of the many apps are just free and going on in-app purchases.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   So it just changes a lot of the approach to how developers have to think.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.200]   And I mean, it's not necessarily good or bad, but it is distinctly a sea change.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.600]   And it's one that Apple forced on the world without anyone really having a choice.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   And yet, Daniel, it sounds like you're not completely unhappy with it. I mean, if it doubles your sales, taking 30% is worth it.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.400]   Yeah, I mean, that's the experience that I had.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:23.300]   So it did put me in a state of mind to be less planated about it.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:23.800]   Right.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.000]   Definitely.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.200]   I think like a lot of developers, I just don't, I just try not to think about the 30% right.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.900]   Just pretend this is a good thing.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.600]   Or do you consider charging 30% more or does that not enter into your?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.800]   I would never, I would never do that because I don't think they let you.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.500]   Well, that's what's a Spotify does, though.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.900]   Remember speaking of Spotify, right?
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.600]   They do.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.300]   You know what?
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.800]   Early on in the very early days, I think they had a rule that said you couldn't do that.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:59.100]   And then I think it just became too blatantly clear that some business models like Spotify can't swallow the loss.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:06.400]   Right. If it's, if it's like a business where the prices of things and the cuts that other people get and there's, you know, other people involved,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:14.600]   that, you know, if, if the music that Spotify is paying for basically has to be paid for at $10 a month or whatever,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.500]   then they can't suddenly be getting, getting by with $7 a month.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.600]   So it's certainly, and it's, it's certainly great that, you know, you saw the doubling in sales.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.300]   I mean, from the take control side and the iBook store, iBook store is 4% of our sales.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.100]   So, you know, it's not, it's, we don't leave the money on the sidewalk, but it's money on a sidewalk.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.000]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.500]   So it doesn't help you much at all in that order.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.500]   I mean, we do it.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.900]   It's, yeah.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:44.800]   But, but then again, Adam and Tonya are a special case where they, they really have built up their own brand.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.300]   You could, you could almost say that they bring more prestige to the iBook store than the iBook store brings an audience to them.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.400]   I want you on my side.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.200]   You should be done.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:03.100]   Well, and that's actually a good point to Andy because as you and I, and all of us probably on this call know that,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:13.100]   there have been a lot of people leaving the app store and a lot of them who have left have been people who I think brought with them prestige away from the app store.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.600]   You know, names that jump to mind like BB edit sketch.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.400]   Gosh, there's, there's a lot that, oh, Panics, Panics stuff.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   And you think these are like the people in the Mac world that are considered like the most successful best examples of development on the platform and then, you know, they're not forced per se to leave.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:43.500]   But if they feel compelled to leave, I think that gets at the core of, you know, that there are problems with the app store and, you know, I, I, you're right, Leo.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:50.800]   I'm not really complaining too loudly about the app store, but it's been, it's been a frustration to me and, and, you know, things like.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.300]   Sandboxing, which, you know, are just like new security requirements for software on the Mac.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.600]   It's, it's like things like that.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:10.000]   You can kind of get behind on the one hand, but be frustrated by the implementation on the other hand and have to acknowledge that it's just slowed a lot of developers down or impeded developers from being able to even do things sometimes.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.200]   It's not just the money either.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   It's oftentimes it's a lot of the developers that I've spoken to who have specific problems with the app store.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:30.100]   It's not even so much the cut that they're taking so much as their force that to participate in the app store means that they have to support certain APIs that Apple is introducing.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:37.700]   And some of these APIs may have really nothing to do with what these creators feel is part of their vision for their software.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:58.200]   But nonetheless, they're taking time and money away from putting in really important new features because they now have to support iCloud and iCloud kicked so many butts of so many developers trying to get this thing to work when the thing really was not in any sort of a shape to deploy to begin with.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:07.500]   And I think that's, that's one of those little things that causes developers to have kind of a sour taste in their mouth about, about the, about the app store where once again, it was a thing that that they just wasted.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:16.800]   Months and months and months of time on a feature that they didn't think was going to deliver any value to their customers on something that really wasn't ready to deploy to begin with.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   So it's a complex problem.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   And as usual, with these things, you tend to, you tend to run the engine at red line until it shakes apart and then you look at the broken pieces and you say, okay, that thing is the thing we need to fix to make a successful version of this.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:43.700]   I guess my cons... only qualm or concern would be if you couldn't still sell the software on your website.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:53.200]   And when they first announced the store, that was my greatest concern, was that Apple was at some point going to say, okay, and that's as it is, by the way, on the iPhone, that's the only way you could do it.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.400]   Had they done that, I would then say, well, now we're really, there's no choice.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.700]   But you can always put it on your website as you do, as Rich Segal does.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:10.700]   So I think for some customers, it's not as desirable.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:18.100]   I know Alex Lindsay says, I really try to buy everything on the App Store because it's so easy when I go to a new machine to just redownload all my apps.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.300]   I get updates automatically.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   There are some real conveniences for end users.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.200]   Yeah, I mean, the App Store is such a great idea.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.600]   And my argument from the beginning with, well, at first it was, I thought, great.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.700]   For the whole first year of the App Store, there was no such thing as sandboxing, the match App Store, I mean now.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:48.300]   And so that was also another one of these kind of, sort of a bait and switch things because people got excited about the App Store, put their apps in, and then a year later, Apple saying to some of them, your stuff's not really welcome here anymore.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.900]   But from the beginning, I thought, okay, let's take the sandboxing idea, making things more secure.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:06.300]   Basically, the gist of sandboxing is requiring an app to accurately identify the types of privileges that it wants to have for your data and access to your network, printing, et cetera.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:18.600]   I thought the best thing Apple could do would be to really embrace that expand the list of things that you can ask for so that it actually covers all of the legitimate software uses on the platform.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:31.500]   And make it so that it would be really appealing to have all software in the Mac App Store because customers don't want to have to think, is this a type of software that is suitable for the Mac App Store?
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.300]   They just want to think, how do I solve a problem?
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   And if I could get it through the Mac App Store, I'll do that.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:43.100]   And then right now, you have this whole classes of software that you just can't be on the Mac App Store.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.300]   And the one that comes to mind is a text expander from Smile, right?
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.900]   It's a beautiful app.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.800]   And of course, there are security implications of software that monitors all of your keystrokes.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.900]   But people want the solution anyway.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:07.900]   And if they could get that through the App Store and if sandboxing had a way to say, hey, just so you know, we're fully admitting here that we're going to monitor keystrokes.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:21.700]   But you had this sort of the same kind of like system for evaluating trust in a company by its reputation, by the number of users it's had over the years, but the fact that they haven't had any security issues that I know of.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.600]   But you know, Apple doesn't want to go there.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.200]   They want to leave the Mac App Store as sort of only a certain class of software.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.800]   And I think that that just sort of breaks the whole system of like you were saying, Alex Lindsay, you know, celebrating like you can go to a new computer and just have all of that.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.400]   All your software show up, but you will never be the case if the Mac App Store can't accommodate all of the software you need.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.000]   Yeah, that's a good.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.200]   Well, and it and I don't know anybody that it does that for.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:56.300]   But if I only have to download, you know, BB edit and Mars edit and I can download everything else out of, you know, you can be migrating anyway.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.100]   I guess I don't buy that as an argument.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:03.700]   The fact is is that you have so many settings, so many documents when you go to a new computer, you want to do a migration.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.000]   Yeah, no, I understand, but I'm just telling you, Alex says it and I kind of agree with him.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.300]   It sure makes it easier.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.800]   I guess one less thing you have to worry about.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.500]   And I suppose to a new computer once every three to five years.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.700]   Ah, see, that's the difference.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.900]   Yeah, we are in a position of using new computers more than once a year.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.300]   So, yeah.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:29.200]   Well, anyway, I'm thrilled to have you, Daniel and everybody should go to red dash sweater dot com and buy their stuff there.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.700]   Right?
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.800]   You would say that, right?
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   Well, you know, I'm still to this day, I'm conflicted because even though I like keeping that extra 30%,
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.400]   there are advantages to selling through the app store.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:45.700]   You get every sale you make through the app store ups your ranking and the sort of the stats and that sort of a self-perpetuating thing.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.700]   If you get up in the right, that's right.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.200]   Same with podcasts, right?
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:49.800]   Right.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   Same story.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   And so I'm really never people ask me like, what do you want me to do?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.600]   And they're trying to be such a great customer and say, you know, how can I do that?
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   And I have to just say, I really don't know.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.700]   So do whatever makes you happy.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.600]   I do.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.900]   I do like the idea of paying of you paying me.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.500]   But how you do it?
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.300]   I'm really not sure what the right choice is.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.600]   And I'm just thrilled whenever I make a sale.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:17.800]   So if you want to buy something by anywhere you can find, it's, you know, just don't pay those pirates online who pretend to be software sales.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:25.600]   So I think I think the really big part that gets us actually is that when you buy from the Mac app store or the app store or the iBook store, whatever,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.400]   you were Apple's customer, not the developer or publishers customer.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.600]   So I can't easily give you free updates.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.400]   I can't communicate with you in any way.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.200]   If you're a snap, I can't support you because I have no, I don't know who you are.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.300]   And so that's the kind of thing that would just be.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:47.200]   Yeah, it would be nice if Apple built some kind of direct connection in so that you felt like those people were your customer.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.100]   Totally agree.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:54.500]   It's, you know, it goes both ways too, of course, because there are some types of software you just want to download as a customer.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.900]   The same way you would buy the software in a box at the store a long time ago and maybe some of us wouldn't fill out the card and fill it out.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.500]   I never fill out.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   I never.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.700]   But so some companies you want a relationship with and some companies you probably don't.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:20.300]   And I do agree though, Adam, it would be nice if Apple gave us some, you know, they went in this direction with the music store of all things when they say, you know, here connect with your favorite artists.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.700]   But they don't want you connecting with your favorite developers, I guess.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.100]   Well, we're just ready.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.900]   If you follow somebody on Apple music, do they get any information about you?
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.500]   Probably not.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.900]   Apple's never going to give anybody your name and email address.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.100]   Probably not.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   No, so we the best we could hope for, I think, are little changes like the ability for developers to respond to reviews, for example, would be nice, you know, just let the, let the like, you know, let the giant like.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:25:00.500]   You know, critical, critical review stand as it is and then have a little response from the developer underneath that says, Hey, this is, this is my impression of this.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.300]   They do that on the Android store and I'm, by the way, I cannot tell you how helpful that is for an end user.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.900]   I'm sure what a relief it is to developers.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   It really, if I'm looking at reviews and I see critical reviews with no rebuttal.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:20.900]   I don't know what to think of it, but when the developer says, oh, you, they don't say this, but in effect, you idiot.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.700]   It's not supposed to work on a droid phone or whatever.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.700]   That's someone else's app.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.700]   Yeah, it's not much.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.700]   Whatever.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.300]   Those things are very useful and I see them all the time now in the Android store.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:38.700]   And by the way, when I see responses, even to negative reviews, I think, well, at least it's an engaged developer and that's really all you can hope for.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.700]   That's what you want.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.700]   So the fact that you're not, you can't do that just.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.900]   That makes me mad.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.500]   Yeah, there's lots of little things.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:55.700]   And that's the thing is, you start going down these lists of developer wishes and for that matter, customer wishes and you start off with one or two and they don't sound like a big deal.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:03.500]   But then as you, as you start to realize just how many there are and I can't even wrap my head around it, you know, usually in one sitting, it's like, oh, we're right.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.900]   And then that's another thing we can't do.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.100]   And that's another problem we have.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.100]   That's in their obstacle.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.300]   I'm really, I am.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   I am.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.500]   And I know I'm a way outlier.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.700]   But I am giving up on commercial operating systems.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.300]   Period.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.500]   I don't want to use Windows or Mac anymore.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.900]   It's a, it hurts me a little bit to leave the Mac platform.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.300]   It's the only thing I have used.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.100]   I gave up a Windows long ago.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.700]   But now I'm actually retiring my 5K.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.900]   I'm at won't retire fully.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.300]   It'll come here and be used, but at home for a free BSD box.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:43.900]   And at the same time as I'm doing that, by the way, I'm also retiring Google cloud storage for.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.100]   A self hosted cloud solution that I'm hopeful will be more secure and more private.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:57.700]   And I'm not a huge privacy advocate, but I just, I'm tired of companies not considering users' needs as paramount.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.700]   Okay.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.700]   Developers are important.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.700]   You should probably consider them too, because to the extent developers are happy, users are happy.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:09.500]   But when you ignore developers and users, I don't think that that company should get my dollar.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.300]   I think that as long as you're leaving people with options, as long as you're giving them a,
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:21.100]   but for instance, the difference between the way that the Mac App Store operates and the iOS App Store operates,
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:26.900]   the Mac App Store, you can have the comfort and the convenience of buying things through a central repo.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:35.300]   But if there are things that are kind of off the grid that either the developer doesn't want to have to deal with the App Store restrictions,
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:42.900]   or it frankly is the type of app that Apple does not approve of, Apple doesn't have to approve of every app that's on your computer.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.900]   You can absolutely defeat that gatekeeper and use it that way.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:55.900]   The problem is that I think that when you have something like iOS where you have no option but to get stuff through this one store,
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:04.500]   and when developers have the situation where we have no option but to conform to whatever rule that Apple wants to impose upon us
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:10.900]   to allow us to have access to this platform, I don't think that it's a particularly evil thing for Apple to do.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:17.700]   I think that it's in Apple's best interest, but it's also in the consumer's best interest, but I don't think it's ideal.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:25.100]   Every time that someone like me complains about what about the consumer who wants this or what about the user who needs this to happen,
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.700]   the way to shut me up is to say, well, they can do that.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   They just don't, they can't do it as easily as they could with this thing that we're trying to encourage them to do.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:40.900]   But yes, if they want to go into settings and then click through eight barriers and then open a lock file cabinet with a buy to sign saying,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:48.500]   "Beware of the Leopard, we're willing to let them do this thing we don't want them to do," because those people are motivated to do things that we think are harmful.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.300]   But that's how to shut me up and that's how I like to be shut up.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   Yeah, I mean, and Apple does things like it. It doesn't want, it bans a surprising range of apps from the iOS app store, political apps, for instance.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   One thing I will say, Leo, though, I do think that it's actually interesting to interesting and important to separate operating systems from apps.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   And one of the things when people start complaining about, "Oh, Apple keeps updating OS 10 now, Mac OS.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.700]   You know, why should I upgrade all that, blah, blah, blah."
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.700]   My answer is usually, "What do you care? You use apps."
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.700]   The operating system exists to allow those apps to run.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   And usually when you go from one operating system to the next, there's not significant compatibility issues for apps that are current and have been kept up.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   And so I find usually going to a new operating system is fairly minimal or maintaining the same one.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:50.700]   I can still use BB Edit and Nisyswriter Pro and Panorama and Google Chrome and whatever the heck I want.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.700]   All stuff that doesn't actually come from Apple.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.700]   It's stuff that I'm layering on top to get the functionality I need.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:06.700]   And so operating systems to me are relatively unimportant to the extent that they give me the capability to the extent they get out of the way.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.700]   Right, precisely.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.700]   But increasingly, look at what happened with Windows. They're getting in the way.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.700]   And then I think they're not serving the role they're in need to serve.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.700]   Yeah, foundation.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   Foundation.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   And that's why I actually feel like I have no choice but to go to open source software, which is created by users for users.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:39.700]   Yeah, and that's fine too. But I think that anybody who goes to an open source operating system does so with an informed consent.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.700]   They understand that they're going to be giving up a lot of people aren't going to do that.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.700]   Yeah, you know from your mother Leo.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.700]   Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.700]   You know, but by the way, and I realize I'm actually kind of excited about it.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   And I realize it's my new game that for me, absolutely, this is like, you know, I'm just like getting a new call of duty.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.700]   Oh, free ASD and I'm reading the ZFS tutorials.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.700]   And, you know, it's a gift for me.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   This is fun.
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.700]   And I realize for most people, not only is it not fun, it's horrible.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.700]   And so I will.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.700]   It's a new bunch of us.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.700]   Chrome buck.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.700]   Yeah, for some of us, that's a grand thing to do.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   I was thinking, I was actually thinking about this with a problem that I had to solve.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.700]   I won't get into the details of it.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:30.700]   But I was so pleased that to solve this problem on this device that ran Linux, it's a consumer box.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:44.700]   The developers, probably because they didn't have the resources to do a really good, like Google style or Apple style solution, simply said that the process to do the thing that you want to do is going to have it's going to be a big pain in the butt.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.700]   But it's going to be a set of linear steps that are absolutely going to work.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:55.700]   And I kind of like the fact that everything I needed to figure out what the solution was was right there in the menus of this device.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.700]   And I could figure out the best way for me to attack the problem and solve it.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   And now it's working perfectly.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.700]   It's working great.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:16.700]   And as I finished getting this thing up and running, it occurred to me that what if this were an Apple device or a piece of Google software where it simply said to set up, just plug it in and just wait for that red light to turn green.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.700]   And well, what if it doesn't turn green?
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.700]   After it turns green, you're ready to go.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.700]   What do I do?
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.700]   Well, if it doesn't turn green, unplug it, plug it in again.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.700]   I tried that didn't work.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.700]   You're welcome.
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.700]   You're saying it's working hard.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.700]   You know, where the software would have been set up to say we don't want to trust it.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:41.700]   Anybody will be able to figure out the sequence of steps that needs to be done to make this happen, even if the individual steps are very, very easy.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:47.700]   So we're going to automate that process through a system that's going to be so complicated that it could fail at several steps.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:53.700]   But we're not going to expose those steps to the user and therefore give him or her the ability to fix it themselves.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.700]   And that's one of the, that's part of the satisfaction of an open source piece of software.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:05.700]   Maybe the ideal world is that it just works without having to fiddle with it or having to trust something automatically happening.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.700]   Fascinating conversation.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.700]   I didn't actually intend to get so philosophical, but I'm glad we did.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.700]   Did we do introduce Adam?
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.700]   Because now we've introduced Adam.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.700]   Thank you, Adam Inks from tidbits for joining us today.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   No, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   There is a lot of actually a lot of Mac news.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:31.700]   Some of it relevant to the conversation we've just been having, including a new TV show that has the best name ever.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.700]   I mean, really, they almost had to do it, right?
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.700]   Yeah, right.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.700]   But first word from audible.com, everybody knows we love, at least I shouldn't say we.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.700]   I and Andy love audio books.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.700]   I won't speak for Adam or Daniel.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:57.700]   Audio books are great for people who commute, great for people who work out, people who do anything, walking the dog running.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.700]   Maybe Adam listens to some audio books while running.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   If you can't hold a book, but you still want to read it.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.700]   What I found is my life got more and more busy, is I just didn't have the reading time I wanted.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.700]   By the time I got in bed, my normal reading time, and opened the book one page.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:18.700]   And so I wasn't getting much reading done for quite a while.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.700]   That's when I discovered audible.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.700]   And this is now back in the year 2000.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.700]   I was commuting and I had two to four hours a day in the car.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   That meant two to four hours a day of reading.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.700]   Man, have I been enjoying it.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   I've been loving it.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.700]   I want you to try audible. We're going to get you a book for free.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.700]   Audible is without peer.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.700]   It is the audio bookstore, a quarter of a million titles.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:45.700]   And maybe even more importantly, all the new books come out on audible now.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:54.700]   It used to be that as a hit or miss whether you get an audio version of a book, pretty much every book now comes out on audible so that you can pretty much be sure that the best sellers are out.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:55.700]   They also go back in time.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:08.700]   And I love this audible created a few years ago, the Audible Frontiers program to take classic science fiction that never was released as an audio book and re-release it on audio, Heinlein and Asimov and Frank Herbert's.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:15.700]   And if you haven't heard Dune, nobody has ever been able to make a good Dune movie.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.700]   I guess I'd get argument on that.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:24.700]   But because it's so expansive and so rich and be so difficult to put in on film, but when you're listening to Dune, you're listening to the music.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.700]   And you're listening to Dune in your mind.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.700]   It is every bit as expansive and magical and vibrant.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   And you are there with the Quisach Haderach.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.700]   And you're participating.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:40.700]   And there's, you know, there's no weird Kyle McLachan getting your way.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.700]   It's there.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.700]   You're in Dune.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.700]   And I love that.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   In fact, at this point, I don't go see a movie unless I've listened to the book first at Audible.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.700]   You can get your free book right now, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.700]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   That's a book a month.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.700]   Your first month is free.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   So that first book is free.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.700]   It's yours to keep, by the way.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.700]   You can't sell any time in the first 30 days and pay nothing.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.700]   You'll also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:09.700]   I should ask Andy what he's listening to on Audible because half of the books I listen to are yours, maybe more.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   I just finished that Patton Dawes won't book that you recommend.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.700]   I loved that.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.700]   Oh, God.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   That was super political.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.700]   Silver's everything he writes.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   Yeah, he's great.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   Well, I'm trying to backfill authors that I was both forced to write, forced to read as a kid and didn't like because I was being forced to read them.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.700]   So I'm sort of seeking out other things.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.700]   Silas Marner never sounded so good.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.700]   That should be the slogan.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   Exactly.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   Well, you know, if you can get me to enjoy Ethan from, that will be the, that hasn't happened yet, but I believe that you could find the right Audible.com book reader to find that I'm saying, okay, fine.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   I do find the imagery of the color of the candy dish.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:37:01.700]   Really actually, you know, it's really good on Audible Moby Dick, which is a great book, but the Audible version is really comes to you're there on the deck.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.700]   It's the peak wad.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.700]   It's great.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   Which version do you have?
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.700]   Is it like almost like a staged readings is multiple voices or just one person reading?
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.700]   No, it's just one person.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.700]   They have a stage reading now.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   I don't know.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   I'd like to imagine that's one of the things they do.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.700]   I love.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:24.700]   Oftentimes, like Neil Gaiman's work, they did a staged reading of American gods where they basically cast every single role.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:32.700]   So it really is like you're in a theater with like 18 actors behind microphones with a script.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.700]   One of my favorite books.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   I love that.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   You're right.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.700]   But I'm saving it for some reason.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.700]   I'm saved.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.700]   I have never read Moby Dick.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.700]   I am saving it for.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.700]   I feel like I have to read it in the original text.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.700]   This is the version I read.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   Frank Mueller, who I really love his narration.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.700]   This is the one I read.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   It's from recorded books.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:01.700]   When you get a book like that where yes, maybe you were forced to read it in school.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   But it's like almost a 200 year old book.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:11.700]   People are still claiming that it is one of the greatest novels ever written, not just for, you know, but if you, yes, it's a little bit dry.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.700]   It doesn't really, it's not really relevant today.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   But if you understand the importance of this book, no Moby Dick is like, no, it's still one of the most gripping and chilling books.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:27.700]   That's why I probably actually it was, I probably have three copies of it, both like in the live library and in the book depository in my stores unit.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:34.700]   Because when I go to my go to use bookstore, it's like, oh, maybe, maybe it's because I don't have it in this really nice cloth binding.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.700]   I'll buy this used copy.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.700]   That would be the copy that I finally read.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   I'm sorry, recommendation, I'm reading the cats cradle by Kurt Vonnigan.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.700]   I've only read breakfast of champions so far.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.700]   And it was one of those things where I got a deal on this book someplace else.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   And then as it happens, you just don't want to, you have to put the book down because you have to go wash dishes or you have to go like it should work on your email.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:10.700]   But if you have the audible version of it, then you can keep reading it as you're doing all this drudgery work and you don't have to leave the world of that book.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.700]   It's good for longer.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.700]   Actually, maybe that would be the best way to do Moby Dick.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:21.700]   Just basically have four or five days of my life where I'm doing nothing but every waking in free time moment, reading or listening to Moby Dick.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:23.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   Well, I think Kurt Vonnigan is a good choice.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.700]   So Slaughterhouse 5 is a wonderful audio book.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   I've read that on an album.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   Anyway, now we're just making it hard for you to choose.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.700]   Audible.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.700]   Audible.com/Mac.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   Break Your First Book is awaiting you in a lifetime of great listening.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.700]   I've now been a member for 16 years.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.700]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.700]   Love Audible.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.700]   Let's move on.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:54.700]   We have a great panel here, not only Andy Inako, but also from Red Sweater Software, Daniel Jalka.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:03.700]   And from Tidbits, one of the longest, the longest running Mac newsletter free at tidbits.com, Mr. Adam Inks.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   It's the planet of the apps.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.700]   I'm kind of, on the one hand, what a great name.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   And Apple's going to produce this.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:17.700]   But on the other hand, I'm a little disappointed that they really are going with just a straight ahead reality show format.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   It feels like that's not as innovative as it could be.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   Especially when you look at how reality shows are produced, where they don't, they really are shaped by producers.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:39.700]   Or at least the understanding when you're watching them is that they didn't just simply pick, like, if this is supposed to highlight the development of apps, they didn't pick the five most promising apps.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:45.700]   They decided they wanted to cast a role of, here is the socially, socially demented nerd.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   Here is the team that works good to well together. Here is the husband and wife who's probably going to, whose marriage might come apart as nerves are frazzled.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.700]   Here's the 12 year old wonder genius.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   And you know that, like, if this world America's got talent, you're like, it doesn't matter who they show in the next 11 weeks.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   You know that they pick the adorable 12 year old girl who cries every time a judge says something nice about her singing.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.700]   They know that they pick her to win.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:23.700]   Well, we like, we love reality shows. I mean, the ratings are great. People love American Idol in The Voice and Survivor and on and on and on.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   Naked dating or whatever it's called.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.700]   By the way, they may be naked, but you don't get to see it. I don't understand. What's the point?
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.700]   OK.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   OK.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:40.700]   The point of the point is scabs. You get to see these scabs in all kinds of places, except for just two or three.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   So I guess this is going to be kind of like, I don't know, Shark Tank or Project Greenlight where you've got 10 app developers and they try to convince the big shots that they're got the next big app and then blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:42:00.700]   Applicants must agree to have their app functional on iOS, Mac OS, TV, OS or Watch OS by late October.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.700]   If they're accepted onto the show, developers will receive guidance from tech experts.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.700]   Potential fund.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.700]   I think they need to be in front of all of us.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:17.700]   Potential funding from VCs of up to $10 million in promotion in Apple's iOS store.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   So they're going to there's an open casting call.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.700]   It will be filming later this year.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.700]   Daniel, are you going to are you going to try out?
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   I wanted to be the Tim Gunn of this show.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.700]   I thought that would be more appropriate.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.700]   We want to be judges.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:45.700]   I have nothing against reality shows, but I just feel like it's as you say, Andy, it's going to be archetypes, but it's also inevitably going to be misrepresenting the real process.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   Oh, of course.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:57.700]   Especially because, I mean, what have we been talking about for this whole first segment of the show, frustrations with the app store with, you know, we haven't gotten into frustrations with submissions and app rejections.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   Yeah, but this defines what it means to be a developer on Apple platforms in many ways, these days.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:16.700]   And even even apart from that, if Apple's paying for the show, you're not, you're not either going to even have things like frustrations with like the inscrutability of an API.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.700]   Oh, you'll never hear about that.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:29.700]   All the kind of stuff that might make for natural drama in a show that's like about something that's kind of hard to jazz up, I think, you know, software development.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:38.700]   But the natural drama, the natural drama will be dealing with problems that Apple doesn't really want to put the spotlight on.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:44.700]   No, and that's my concern is this really just going to be a great big ad for Apple and how great it is.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.700]   And, oh my God, you've won the jackpot. You're going to be the next, what's happened?
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   And that's really, I think, not the message should be that the kids, especially, were thinking of this as a career should be.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:03.700]   Yeah, I had an idea for Apple's, you know, why would Apple choose to do this show of all shows?
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:12.700]   And Apple is sort of like so many tech companies just famously troubled by recruiting, right, trying to find employees.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.700]   This is how you find talent.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:30.700]   They're going to have a roster of ambitious, you know, probably not all of them talented, but they're going to have a pretty good dossier here of people who are willing to really, I guess, fight for being a developer, fight for building great apps.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   And then Apple being the one in charge of all this, I guess, they can just come swoop in and say, regardless of whether you got on the show or whether you won the show.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:45.700]   Would you like to come interview for this? Oh, that's a really good point, Daniel. That may be the real reward, the job at Apple.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   Yeah, forget that. I mean, how much trouble are they having attracting talent as it is?
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   Daniel, by the way, we didn't mention this, but you were an Apple. You worked at Apple. You were developer at Apple.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:06.700]   I was, yeah, starting in 1995 through 2002. So I've been out of Apple for much longer than I ever worked there, but I do have some experience with the company.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:12.700]   And of course, it's fueled my interest over the last. Yeah, and you were there at the Reapers. What did you work on?
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:21.700]   I worked on System 7, System 8, and then I jumped ship from the System 7 team and went to work on very early OS 10 stuff.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:29.700]   And the stuff I was working on was always really low level stuff, usually stuff with no graphics interface, you know, so stuff on System 7.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:44.700]   I worked on stuff like the process manager. And then I switched over to OS 10 and worked on stuff like the code fragment manager, which was the thing that loads the code literally from disk to make an app run.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:53.700]   So it was real low level, you know, real nerdy stuff, but yeah, it was an experience. And to be there at that time, I was hired.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:04.700]   I was actually hired as a full time employee in 1996, a few months before Steve Jobs came back. So really quite a time to be there.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   And, you know, people talk about it a lot these days, but that was the time when, wow, the folks who were at Apple then and stuck around, that was like a time to really believe in the company because everybody was leaving to go to companies that, you know, conventional
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:36.700]   wisdom would say had a shot in the world and Apple was at the bottom of that list for almost everybody, including many people, you know, many of us who were in the company, I think still thought it was a long shot, but we were just couldn't find anything better to work on.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:51.700]   So I was excited to be there. And I'm really, I'm really proud of Apple for, you know, making it as far back as they have. And now that now that I only complain to say they're so powerful that, you know, I certainly have no, no ability to
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:57.700]   to rain in that power. So, see, see how far they go, I guess.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:07.700]   Eddie Q gave a interview to the Hollywood reporter. You know, at first I thought, oh, this is great. Let's see what Eddie says. But it really was.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:19.700]   It wasn't what I'd call a hard hitting interview. It was basically Eddie making his pitch to Hollywood, right? Remember, he's talking to Hollywood.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:36.700]   For why Apple is going to be the next big creator. They did ask him about Planet of the Apps. They also asked him about Dr. Dre's reputed TV show and he didn't, he denied knowledge of it. He said, I think Dre's filming something.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:41.700]   Given Eddie's job, I think he probably knows more than that.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   The bit about the skinny bundle, what was interesting. Yeah. So he didn't want to, I mean, basically, he was saying that Apple wasn't a big fan of the skinny bundle where you get to pick and choose what you want.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:59.700]   He was claiming that people are mostly just frustrated by how hard it is to deal with the fat bundles.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:10.700]   Yeah. So when I read that, I thought, oh, yeah, he knows who he's talking to. And he's reassuring them, don't worry. We're not going to do it to you what we did in the music industry.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:21.700]   Because, of course, what was Apple's big change in music industry, the 99 cent single, the elimination and effect of the album format, the skinny bundle of music.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   And he said, so I think whether it's true or not, I think it's a message, right? Don't worry. We're not going to disintegrate. He says, if Time Warner or Direct TV wants to offer a bundle themselves, they should do it through Apple TV and iPad and iPhone.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:49:01.700]   Of course, well, just be the middle man. Whatever you want. Yes. I still don't understand the pitch that they would make to cable companies or even individual cable channels that would not make them just another player among many.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:09.700]   Anything that would give Apple a distinct advantage over anything else. Apple's ambition is not to be a better Roku. I don't think I would hope.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:22.700]   That's that'd be that'd be a tall order for them to put for them to actually do. Not even be able to do it. Okay. Yeah. I can't think of anything that I'm getting on my latest generation Apple TV that I can't get on other boxes and clean the Roku.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:37.700]   And it's not because of Apple's not doing their job or the technologies fall in behind, but because a company like sling, what is it in? What's in it for them to create an app or create a service that works on Apple TV, but does not work on competing services.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   And I think that the Apple's part of Apple's whole business plan is let's make stuff that is an exclusive Apple experience and not necessarily lock people into the platform, but essentially make give them the advantages of a one overseer overseeing the hardware, the operating systems,
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:50:10.700]   the and the app platform all at once. So this is not me saying that this doesn't make sense merely that I don't immediately understand what they could say to HBO or another company saying that this is why you should give us an advantage that you're not going to give to other people.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:17.700]   But what would we like Apple to do? I mean, where's the real opportunity? If you ask me and we've been begging Apple to do this all along and they starting to move in that way.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:34.700]   And music is to disintermediate artists and creators and to become a direct conduit just as they are for you, Daniel, of your apps to Apple customers to be a distributor of music and television and movies direct to the audience.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   Right. Can you imagine if Mars at Acorn, you had to, you know, we had to go through Warner Brothers or something to get and we take that for granted now.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:53.700]   And, you know, maybe it is, maybe starting with stuff like Planet of the Apps. Maybe that's the first step towards that.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.700]   The way you start, of course, is by going down a Hollywood and saying, "Don't worry, we're not going to do that."
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:05.700]   Well, exactly. And it's funny when you were talking about IDQ's comments, it's like, what usually precedes Apple doing something.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.700]   Right. This is taking the Steve Jobs role.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.700]   Right. Right.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.700]   Nobody wants that.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.700]   Absolutely. Nobody wants that.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:20.700]   Well, also, you could also, for showing that line, you could also say that the Planet of the Apps is sort of like the Motorola rocker.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.700]   And you're doing content business saying that we don't intend for this to be as success in any way, shape, or form.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:35.700]   We just want to like, we just want to kick a rock down the pile, see where it bounces so that when we kick our own rock, it makes it to the bottom safely.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:47.700]   On the note of the Planet of the Apps, I've also heard a lot of things I'm sure you all have as well about Apple's sort of like semi-secretly or completely secretly funding some of these music videos that have gotten.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.700]   Yeah. Taylor Swift's.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.700]   And who was that guy? I don't even remember his name, but some rapper.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.700]   Drake. I think there was one of the Drake.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.700]   I think there was a rumor that Hotline Bling was a...
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.700]   Hotline Bling, right.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.700]   Yeah. Right.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   Is that Drake? I don't know.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.700]   Yeah, I'm not really up on this stuff.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.700]   I'm not either, but the kids...
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:15.700]   But, you know, if that's music, obviously, that's sort of inherently different, I think, from fully produced television programs and such.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:23.700]   But I guess if you've got a team that knows how to make television shows, and Apple offers you a bunch of money, why wouldn't you consider that?
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:28.700]   Eddie says... This is again, remember who he's talking to.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:34.700]   We are only going into the content business with projects we think are really tied to our products.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.700]   Right now, that's Apple Music.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   The rest of it is about giving talent a platform that allows them to be creative in new ways.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:49.700]   If I was an agent, I would be very, very excited about what Apple is doing because it lets the people that I represent be able to do more.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:54.700]   So, if an agent came to you with a show, a package with a big star, would you take it?
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:59.700]   No, probably not right now. We're not in the business of trying to create TV shows.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:08.700]   If we see it being complimentary to the things we're doing at Apple Music, or if we see it being something that's innovative or not a platform, we may help them and guide them and make suggestions.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.700]   But we're not trying to compete with Netflix or Comcast, Evan, for fun.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.700]   I'm sorry, that was a dramatization.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.700]   Oh, I thought you had Eddie on the show.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.700]   He does not sound like that.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.700]   I'm sorry, an audible, you're on audiobook of the interview.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.700]   Yeah, the Eddie Q story.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:33.700]   But it does indicate that they have at least, they're starting to learn the culture of entertainment.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.700]   No, no, no.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.700]   We just, we just, there's a way that we can enhance your product.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.700]   We have a few notes.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.700]   They're just notes.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.700]   Just notes.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.700]   They can't leave them.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   They don't wait.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.700]   It's more telling that they deny it.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   It is really that thing of, oh, we wouldn't do that.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   It's almost saying, yeah, we're going to do that.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.700]   We're thinking about it, right?
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:58.700]   Or at least what purpose, or at least the Eddie Q and Apple has some purpose for making that
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   statement.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.460]   And that's, you know, I don't think they do a lot of things by random, or, you know, by
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.700]   accident, I should say.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.700]   And it's no accident that Eddie Q is spending.
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.700]   What does he say he goes to Hollywood five times a month or something?
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.700]   I mean, which is a strange number.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.460]   I'm trying to figure out, does that mean twice in one week and then once a week, the
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:17.460]   other weeks?
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:18.700]   What's the basketball schedule?
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.060]   Oh, he's going, you know what?
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.060]   That's right.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.060]   He's a big Warriors fan, isn't he?
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.060]   That's right.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.060]   We saw him during the playoffs down there on the floor.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.060]   Repeatedly.
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.060]   The cover of everything.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.060]   Repeatedly.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:38.580]   But it's, you look at it, well, Amazon's tried to do something like this with Amazon Studios.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   But how many?
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.100]   I mean, well, that Netflix is different.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.340]   They were, they were an entertainment portal to begin with.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.380]   It was a really natural thing for them to do.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.940]   And also there weren't they kind of like the first one to come up with this idea of, well,
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:57.780]   what if we were to offer not quite as much money as CBS, maybe not even quite as much
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:03.980]   money as HBO, but we will give you a good amount of money and make us, we will, we're
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.380]   asking for eight episodes and then just, we will, we will expect it.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   We will expect it.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.580]   It be delivered by FedEx on flash drive on this date.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.060]   And that's the last time you'll see with this.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:18.300]   The last time you'll see anything written from us is our name on a check.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.780]   It's, it's, it would be interesting if they could do something along the lines of let's
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:27.860]   Louis, Louis CK, when he did his last, his last series, he did it direct to his fans,
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.420]   like through his, you know, through his email list.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:36.060]   And if they created a system by, as a result, a lot of people didn't know anything about
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.060]   this new series.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.500]   I can't even remember the name of it.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.100]   I've just heard people, people writing and talking about it.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.340]   If they could do something like that where they, Louis will take 30%, but we will, we
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.340]   will distribute it.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.700]   We will, we will, we will let it be promoted with the, with social media.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.420]   We will occasionally do put it in an editor's picks.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.820]   You don't have to worry about distribution.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.700]   You don't have to pay about, pay for anything other than just creating it and then just
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.620]   giving us a master files that will do it.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:04.620]   It's, it's interesting.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.300]   I, I, like I said, most of the, when I talk about this, it's, I just don't understand how
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.620]   this could work.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.860]   But that's usually how innovation happens when you create something that is so new that no
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.060]   one could have seen it.
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.940]   But as soon as it is, you, you show it in front of them, they could say, Oh, this seemed
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.340]   inevitable, like the iPhone.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.340]   Apple always likes to do an event, the inevitable.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:29.420]   It's never inevitable to lapel, does it?
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:38.260]   Um, I love the register and I did, I love their, the, their take on stuff.
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:43.700]   Here in McCarthy says headline McCain, come to my encryption hearing, Tim Cook.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.980]   No, no, I'm good.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.180]   McCain, I hate you.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.180]   I hate you.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.180]   I hate you.
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:55.260]   Um, clearly that's not the verbatim transcript of the conversation.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:57:01.620]   Um, John McCain, uh, invited Tim Cook to attend a Senate hearing on encryption, the
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:06.420]   committee on arms services, hearing on cyber security last week.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:10.940]   McCain went out of his way to note that Cook has declined the senators invitation to give
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:15.660]   testimony alongside three opponents of end to end encryption on the company's iPhone.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:20.940]   I must note for the record that these were not our only invited guests.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.900]   McCain said the committee extended an invitation.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.300]   Apple CEO Tim Cook, he declined.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.740]   I hope we were considering the future.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:30.300]   So this committee can benefit from the widest possible variety of perspectives.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.940]   That doesn't sound like I hate you.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.940]   I hate you.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.940]   I hate you.
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.740]   I hate you.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:41.620]   But, uh, you know, the fact that none of the people he really wanted to talk about, you
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:47.260]   know, why I wish Tim Cook had gone or sent a proxy because I think it's important to educate
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:55.060]   these guys on why we need end to end encryption and why it's impossible to stop it.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.940]   But they continue to have hearings.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:57.940]   Hmm.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.940]   Well, also, McCain's been saying some kind of harsh stuff.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.820]   He's up for reelection, I think, this year is me.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.660]   And so he's been saying he's been saying a lot of things that I think that Tim Cook may not
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.340]   be very, very happy about.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.460]   So but I don't know if that would preclude him actually.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.460]   That's why you go.
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.460]   Sending a representative.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.820]   Well, or you don't go yourself, but that's why you send if you weren't if you don't feel
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:23.740]   like anything productive to Apple is going to happen or anything productive to the world
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.100]   in general is going to happen.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.140]   You don't go just to get the free pin.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:33.060]   Well, it's also the third rail because it's best at this point for Apple just to shut
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.620]   up about this stuff.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.620]   Right?
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.300]   Because on the one hand, they can be forced.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.620]   It doesn't, you know, uh...
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.020]   I think Apple picks its battles.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:42.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:47.300]   And this is not, this is not currently one of them that they wish to be playing in.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:51.020]   They want, they want to make sure that when they're pulling out the big guns that they're
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:55.220]   actually doing it in a place that it matters, not at a time when, you know, it's going to
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.220]   be Tim Cook with three guys shouting at him.
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:04.100]   I think they got as much as they needed and wanted from the San Bernardino court case.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:09.740]   They demonstrated to the public that they want privacy and that they care and we're
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:13.100]   the privacy company, we're the security company.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:19.260]   Anything more they say will not be beneficial particularly since what could happen is the
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:23.220]   public could understand that it's not up to Apple.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.020]   And then in fact Apple isn't necessarily protecting their privacy, things like that.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.860]   That's the kind of conversation you don't want to have.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:34.500]   I think it would be smart for Tim to get up with his winnings and walk away from the table
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.700]   and I think that's what's happening.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.020]   I don't think it's a sniff fit.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.020]   He's a smart guy.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.020]   Unlike Steve.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:43.340]   I mean you could, Steve, Steve would say, you know, would have a sniff fit.
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:44.380]   But I think Tim does not.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:50.580]   I think Tim is very measured, cautious and smart and I think he says, "No, we're good."
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.580]   Exactly right.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.580]   We're good.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.180]   We're exactly where we want to be on this.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.020]   And the further conversation is not going to help.
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.940]   As you said, Amy, it's going to help our business.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.940]   Yes.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.660]   Also wonder how much the fact that this is an election year could affect things, not just
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.300]   with Senate and race, but with the presidential race.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:16.140]   Because you could, it's, I think we're all kind of relieved that treating encryption as
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.940]   a tool for terrorism and for no other purpose.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.980]   I feel as though that have been floated as a trial balloon by a lot of people.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.180]   Is this something that can really get people scared?
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:30.300]   And if so, can we scare people into voting for our person based on this?
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.180]   And that's why we haven't seen this.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.780]   It went up and then went down and no one really cared about it.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:40.300]   Maybe part of the decision making is also, is this going to be a thing where, well, you
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:45.700]   know, I brought Apple right into this conference room and I told him that they, you know, he
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.420]   that they just can't talk to these people.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:49.900]   That's why you need to put me in the Senate.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.540]   That's why you need to put me in the governorship because only people like me can protect you
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.940]   from damn nangers.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:02.620]   I think the encryption, I think the encryption is a little too complex for a campaign that
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.140]   that it's just one of those things.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.340]   It's hard to, it's hard to get it.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.980]   Not, not, not as complicated as not as simple as international terrorism.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.140]   I think you can make it.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.100]   I think you can make us drum it down to you are in danger right now.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.940]   I'm going to protect you from danger by fighting those people.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:27.860]   I saw, I saw a flashlight commercial a commercial for a cheap Chinese made flashlight that said,
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.740]   okay, well, even if it runs in the rain, that's great.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.140]   And if you can drop it and that's fine.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.140]   That's it.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:37.420]   Oh, it also has this if, if burglars try to attack your family, it has the special strobe
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.260]   light mode that'll scare them off.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.260]   You don't want it.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.100]   You don't want your people to your family be attacked by burglars without the fact that
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.100]   they're off this special flashlight.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.100]   Do you?
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.500]   I'm like, it's a flashlight.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:53.020]   Is this so easily we can, you think we can be controlled by fear that we have a magic
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.340]   flashlight that scares off bad guys.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.180]   Like, oh, God.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:02.860]   So yes, I, I do believe that they could dumb it down to the purpose of being this is the
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.620]   weapon that Isis wants to use against you.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:09.860]   I don't want Isis to have this tool, but the person I'm running against, he wants or she
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.260]   wants you to have, you want, wants Isis to have this tool.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.260]   Okay.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.940]   We just need that, that John Oliver interview with Edward Snowden, where he gets Snowden
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:22.380]   to go through all the different, all the different NSA programs, which were designed
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.220]   to, to, you know, get a, get a, get a look at your picks.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.740]   We're going to take a break.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.180]   Adam Anks is from tidbits is here tidbits.com.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.060]   Great to have you and your giant penguin.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.260]   I never go anywhere without my giant penguin.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.540]   By the way, that is not a Linux penguin.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.940]   But don't get your panties in a bunch.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.940]   Right?
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.140]   It's just a penguin.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.860]   This, this, this penguin, well, it doesn't predate Linux, but it is indeed unrelated.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.860]   It's not a tux.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.740]   Actually, now that I notice you have three penguins in view, at least.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.740]   Okay.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.740]   Are you?
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.740]   I can see at least five.
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.740]   What's a, what?
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   Oh, four.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:02:59.740]   Holy cow.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.700]   You can't, when you can't see the post behind me.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.900]   No, I see five.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.340]   I see, is that light switch a penguin?
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.340]   Light switches are penguins.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.340]   Holy camoly.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.940]   It's a good game we could play.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:16.300]   I spy with my little eye, a flightless bird.
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:20.700]   So the, the poster on the door behind me is this photographer who has, he's taken, I
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.540]   think Andy's done some stuff like this with cows, where he took some plastic penguins
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:28.100]   around the world and took pictures of them all over the place.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.460]   And he published a book of this.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.100]   It's a wonderful, wonderful poster.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.060]   I'm just going to start calling you Mr. Popper.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.060]   Are you?
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.900]   Oh, I have a copy of that too.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.900]   What do we talked about this?
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.900]   You're kind of a penguin.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.980]   It, I've liked penguins since I was four.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.660]   I have my first penguin from the New York Aquarium when I was four.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.980]   Have you ever smelled penguins?
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:47.980]   Yes.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.180]   They're not the most.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.460]   Well, it did, I mean, have you smelled the chicken house?
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.740]   Yeah, it's, it's no.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.740]   Chicken house is worse.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.580]   A chicken house is worse.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.100]   But I remember going, where was I?
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.540]   We were in South America and going to a penguin colony.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.580]   I visited penguins in Tasmania.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.580]   Oh, me.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.300]   On the, on the Bruni Islands off the coast of Tasmania.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.980]   So, you know, Australia is an island off the coast of Asia.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:20.820]   Bruni, Tasmania is a coast, an island off the coast of Australia.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.300]   The Bruni Islands are islands off the coast of Tasmania.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.340]   It's islands all the way down.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.740]   It's, well, no, it's 1500 miles to Antarctica.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.740]   Wow.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.420]   You're, no, there's nothing left.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   Wow.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:35.020]   So, these were the little blue penguins come to, come to next.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.020]   Oh, neat.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.900]   We went there in 1998 and enjoyed a immensely.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.300]   I really did enjoy seeing the penguins.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.500]   Actually, that was really cool.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.540]   And I want to see more penguins.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.180]   Those are emperors behind you, right?
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   The one behind me is from Emperor.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.900]   He was actually, was a friend, a present from a friend from Australia who brought him over
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.060]   from Australia.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.780]   We're going to also with us Daniel Jalkut, red-swetter.com, red sweater software, one
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.780]   of my favorite--
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.020]   Look at his ground.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:06.020]   What is he had pictures of?
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.020]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.020]   He has an improvised corner here.
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.020]   Yeah, no.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:13.540]   Did your wife actually get-- did she, like, have to leave?
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.540]   We have a big house.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.540]   Okay.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.540]   I feel bad.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:17.700]   Probably the kids were most impacted.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.140]   We moved to the only house, only room in my house that has a wired ethernet connection,
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.260]   which is right where the TV is, of course.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.300]   No, I have the same problem.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.300]   No, there's, you know, yeah.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.180]   It has to be near the cable outlet.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.180]   Right.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.140]   I don't have to figure out how to wire this place up a little better.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.020]   Well, thank you for doing it because I tell you what, great picture, great sound.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020]   It works wonderfully.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.860]   I'm glad it worked out in the end.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.180]   It solved the problem.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:47.700]   And of course, Andy Inaco, who has cleverly sanitized his background to reveal nothing
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   about himself.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.700]   It's all for his admire.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.980]   The rest of my office is immaculate and spotless behind the right.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:57.380]   I put up the screen so you're not intimidated by the cleanliness and the odor and the tidiness
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:59.100]   behind my office.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.300]   By the way, the rebuttal from the chat room is, yeah, penguins smell, but have you ever
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.300]   smelled humans?
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.900]   What do you think we smell like to penguins?
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.060]   They, they go, the penguins.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.060]   Oh God.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.060]   What's that?
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.060]   Oh, it's more humans.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:21.900]   Oh, if they had, if they could, they'd wave their little fins.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.380]   We invented breath mints.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.980]   What have penguins done about that fish breath?
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.980]   That's true.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.500]   That's true.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.460]   They perhaps like fish breath.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.380]   They probably say have a mackerel instead of have a breath mint.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:40.620]   It's like just smelling a little like polar bear have a mackerel or show today brought
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:45.340]   to you by the employer.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.500]   They proud by the Adobe marketing cloud.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.020]   These guys actually have done some great stuff.
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.100]   If you're, if you're marketer, you know Adobe marketing cloud.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.620]   They do a lot of white papers, a lot of interesting research.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:59.540]   They help train people on using marketing more effectively.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:02.740]   And now they've made audio, I guess I could call it a podcast.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:08.540]   It's on iTunes podcast for reading their audio white papers and they're read by they hired
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.580]   really good readers and if they really are great.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:17.300]   Audio, if you want to find them, go to iTunes and search for audio white papers for marketing.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.540]   If you're marketing pro or you know, just in business and you, you know, you want to
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.740]   market your business better and want to stay up to date on the latest marketing trends
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.100]   and technologies, these are great because they're all under a half an hour you can listen
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.620]   to on the way in.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.180]   You'll learn so much like the differences between interaction metrics, engagement metrics
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:39.820]   and value metrics help you figure out what create, which part of your creative is working,
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:45.100]   creating personalized content is relevant to customers using predictive analytics, creating
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:48.860]   a 360 degree view of each customer no matter where they're interacting with your brand
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.860]   a lot more.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.540]   Here's the best way to do it.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:57.060]   Go to, just open iTunes and search audio white papers for marketing or you could Google Adobe
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.860]   audio white papers for marketing or go to adobe.com for more information and really
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:02.860]   is great and they're free.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:07.380]   By the way, did I mention free audio and it's not a big sell for Adobe or anything.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.900]   It's just really useful, valuable information.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.260]   Audio white papers for marketing.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:22.860]   We thank Adobe marketing cloud for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:29.860]   Turns out that the special forces is no longer going to use a Samsung Galaxy phone.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:34.460]   The army special operations command has ditched the Android.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.660]   What are they going to use?
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:41.820]   The iPhone 6S because they say it's faster and smoother and when you're sneaking up on
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.380]   the enemy, you don't want to wait for the phone to load.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:49.620]   You got to make sure you flip that little switch so it doesn't rang accidentally.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:56.740]   Oh God, that would be terrible.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.260]   According to a source not authorized to speak to the media, which explains why he's talking
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:06.740]   to TechCrunch, the Samsung device that acts as the brain of the Android tactical assault
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.500]   kit is a clunker.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.460]   Well yeah, they're using a note too.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.900]   It's four generations old.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:16.940]   And the battery's almost dead.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.860]   It lags, it freezes, it needs to be rebooted.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:25.220]   The iPhone 6S apparently is faster and smoother.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:30.020]   And get this, a split screen view of a drone's live video on the map showing its route, for
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.100]   instance, is better on Apple hardware.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.020]   The source says it's seamless on the iPhone.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.220]   The graphics are clear.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.900]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:40.660]   Wow.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.380]   So I didn't know this, but they had ATAC.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.820]   They had the Android tactical assault kit.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.780]   This was a real thing.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.100]   And I guess it'll now be ITAC.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:58.500]   Does it come up to fucking ungo?
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:04.460]   I wonder if the people in government who want Apple to reduce the security of their
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.460]   voice.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.460]   That's a point.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.420]   Talking to these guys because you know, I always feel pretty good when I realize I've
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:16.580]   got a phone that apparently the US military thinks secure enough for their purposes.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.300]   So, you know, it kind of occurs to me.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.860]   I had this thought earlier, Leo, and this is something I'm curious to get your take on.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:31.460]   So you talking about leaving like the, you know, leaving the OS makers like Apple and
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:36.100]   Windows Microsoft and stuff because you should only because they left me first.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.100]   Right.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:43.180]   So one of the things that came to mind is I have a hard time imagining how security gets
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:49.620]   addressed quite as well as it does with Apple when there's not the sort of funding power
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.860]   of millions of customers buying hardware.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.700]   Well, that's a really interesting point of view.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   I'd never heard.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.500]   I want to open sources inevitably more secure because the source code is published.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.860]   You don't know what Apple's doing behind the scenes.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.180]   But I don't know that that's true because the source code being published means that
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:14.140]   anybody who has an incentive to crack it also has complete unfettered access to it.
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.380]   And you know, there's bugs.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.380]   Absolutely.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.460]   The bugs will surface, but it's my, you know, they're going to surface anyway.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:26.420]   They will surface and be fixed much faster in the track record for open source software
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:27.660]   and securities.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.500]   You know, I mean, heart bleed aside.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:34.980]   There are, you know, in open SSH, there have been issues, but I think you're far more
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.300]   secure.
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.420]   And by the way, you're less of an attack surface because if you're a bad guy, you're
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:45.740]   going after Windows, maybe Mac and absolutely not free BSD.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.660]   It's just not going to pay off.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:48.660]   You know, what are you going to get?
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.660]   A couple of neckbeards in a closet.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.660]   It's not.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.660]   And me.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:54.660]   It's not.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:58.940]   So no, I think the security and if you look at BSD particularly.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.140]   Now there's a, I'm going to use free BSD because it has a larger community.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:08.180]   But if you go to open BSD, that is widely agreed by every security expert I know to be
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.620]   the most secure and private operating system.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:15.260]   And because there is no commercial entity behind it, there's no incentive to gather your
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.340]   information.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.020]   You fully control what's happening with it.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:24.340]   So I think Daniel, there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that I am not only more secure
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.580]   but more private using open source software.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.580]   Here's my concern.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:33.020]   So I do agree on the whole that the source code being out there makes it more likely to
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.300]   be vetted for problems.
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:42.900]   There's some, the place where I'm still not quite with you is Apple is in, it has an incentive
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:48.700]   to make better secure, not just to be more, not just to be more committed to security,
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.220]   not just to be like, I trust that all these free BSD open BSD people are committed to
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.300]   security.
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:57.460]   But the question is, what kinds of things can Apple do whether it's like coming up with
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:03.140]   better encryption algorithms, whether it's usability stuff that just makes it easier for
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:08.500]   you to sink your password, say encrypted over the web.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:13.980]   What is the sort of breadth of things to address user security issues that we sort of get
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:21.740]   quote unquote for free by funding Apple's massive enterprise that you could have in
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:27.580]   purely open source stuff, it's limited to what those geniuses who happen to put their
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.860]   time into open source software are able to come up with.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.740]   And I guess this is a common question about open source in general.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.500]   Somebody has to be this on the radio show.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.900]   But where's the money in it?
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:43.180]   And I think that you probably know, Daniel, that there's quite a few very accomplished
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.580]   programmers who do it for reasons other than the paycheck.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.700]   Many of them do have day jobs and do this as a hobby.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.260]   I think some of the top security people in the world are working in open source.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.620]   Phil Zimmerman did PGP in open source.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:03.700]   GPG, which is the truly open because he sold it, truly open version of PGP benefits from
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700]   that.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:11.500]   I'm not convinced that a commercial entity shares our interests in privacy and security.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:16.020]   I admit they have the funding, but I don't know if money is the signing factor.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:22.580]   And I think that a lot of people wonder why is there so much, why is Linux so why is that
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:26.220]   such a diverse ecosystem when there's no money in it?
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.380]   Because programmers do it for a variety of reasons besides money.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.380]   You know that Daniel.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.260]   Well, I know that absolutely.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:39.620]   But I guess I just don't know the, I'm just ignorant on that front about how much active
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:44.260]   really like cutting edge security work is going on in the open source community.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.300]   We may very well be completely right and may outpace what Apple's doing.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.900]   I guess I have a bias because of it accepting Apple's marketing, right?
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.900]   To some extent.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:57.500]   Well, it out paces it not only because they're, believe it or not, larger numbers of people
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:02.780]   working on it, but they don't have the same marketing commercial pressures that somebody
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.340]   working at Apple does, the same limitations.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.620]   They're working at it because they care and they want it to be.
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:13.660]   And I think there probably is nobody more security and privacy focused than the open
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.660]   source community.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:21.380]   I don't doubt in any way that they are, every single one of them cares a lot about this.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.980]   And the users care a lot about it.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:26.740]   And the users are the ones who are giving them feedback.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:32.740]   So I look into it because I think you, I think you'd be very impressed in fact.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.380]   And if you're going to use encryption, are you going to prefer file vault over true crypt?
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:42.340]   Actually true crypt's gone, but let's pick another open source program or let's say Vera
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.340]   crypt.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.460]   I far prefer to use Vera crypt.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   I don't know.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:50.260]   I don't know how, you know, I know what white papers Apple publishes and think I really
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:54.300]   am grateful that Apple publishes those white papers because they're very forthcoming about
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.820]   their security a little bit less.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:01.660]   So we'll see what they say about differential privacy, which could be good or could be bad,
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:02.820]   depending on how they implement it.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.700]   We got to see the white papers on that.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:08.100]   But at the same time, we don't know what's in that file vault blob.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:15.700]   And in fact, due to the way the laws are written in this land, there absolutely could
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.420]   be governmental back doors on it that Apple wouldn't be able to talk about.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:24.100]   And the other thing is it kind of ties into the story we just talked about.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:29.700]   It's it's it's nice that the people in field operations now get to use a much faster and
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:34.220]   more responsive phone than a note to when they're doing their very important jobs.
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:40.380]   But remember that a couple was it a three or four weeks ago that it got out that Obama
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.220]   finally has a smartphone and it is an Android device.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.780]   It's not and that's not because Android is necessarily a better platform, but because
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.860]   it's a more open platform.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:56.620]   It's more easy for for the Department of Defense and others to customize all the system software
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.100]   so that it can do the things that the president's phone needs to do.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:05.340]   So it's it's that that I don't I wouldn't say that it's necessarily more secure to have
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:10.060]   an open source operating system though, only because remember that one of the great thing
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:15.140]   with the great advantage of open source software is also its greatest problem in that it assumes
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:18.980]   that you know what you're doing and you know what each parts in this engine are for and
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.260]   what they do.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:25.380]   And so if there is a weakness somewhere inside your system, it understands that the the
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:31.500]   implication is that you are a seasoned system administrator, you know that you're doing tests,
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:36.660]   you're doing the penetration operations on your own systems and you know how to fix this.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.300]   Whereas you're going to have with Apple, you just all you know, all that happens is with
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.740]   an Android phone with with an iPhone with with a Mac, you get a security update, you
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.220]   click OK, and then you hope that doesn't blow up your system.
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:50.900]   But then your your system is already investigated and patched.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.900]   Life is life.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.740]   I mean, look, all life is trust, right?
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:58.220]   I mean, and using it any software is trust unless you're writing it from scratch yourself
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:03.100]   and oh, by the way, let's go to the foundry and make our own chips while we're at it because
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:04.740]   that's software too.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.260]   So you have to trust people.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:11.620]   I mean, you know, one of the things about open BSD, which is interesting is their decision
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.420]   is to make all the default secure.
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:18.140]   So if you without knowing anything installed open BSD on a computer, you would have probably
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.900]   them and I think this is widely agreed.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:25.620]   I'm not making this up the most secured system possible without now you can of course break
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.860]   that security.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:33.300]   But but if you just installed the defaults the way they've set that up, it would be highly
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.940]   secure.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.020]   And then privacy issues and other issue.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:42.180]   It's funny because I I give up privacy all the time and that's my choice.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:47.540]   But I think you can you Apple pays lip service.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.220]   But you know, one of the things they don't want to talk about and they still not talking
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:55.020]   about is the fact that they have the keys to your cloud, your iCloud.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:00.700]   And in fact, I I inferred from the San Bernardino discussion that they willingly turn over people's
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.700]   iCloud information to long.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.700]   They have to.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:04.700]   They have to.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:06.700]   Right.
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:11.580]   So and what I was hoping to see at WWDC is some statement to the effect of and we're
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.020]   going to encrypt your cloud.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:21.620]   And I actually I thought it was very telling in the absence of that.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:26.100]   I don't maybe they just don't have something in place yet.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.100]   I don't know.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.060]   I don't know of any again, not a lawyer.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:34.420]   I've been having I've been I've been the beneficiary of having a lot of very good lawyers confuse
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:38.180]   me with with what the laws are for data retention.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.500]   I don't know of any law that says that if that Apple is storing stuff on behalf of customers
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:46.780]   that they have to make sure that they have access to that data for the purposes of providing
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:51.060]   to law enforcement, I wouldn't I do believe that Apple would try to do that.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:56.380]   They their policy seems to be our best defense against government intrusion is to make sure
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:02.940]   that even we do not have the ability to decrypt the messages and encryption and messages.
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.980]   They've they've done that with the phone.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:10.260]   I would really like to see them step step up and say and by the way on iCloud trust no
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.900]   one only you have the keys.
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:18.940]   But they they barely got iCloud work into like I know I get the right document back.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:24.620]   One thing at a time and also see this is this is another reason why I I to have like a cloud
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.260]   system on my home server.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:32.180]   But I wouldn't you I the thing is I trust Dropbox to be very much much better at securing
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:36.220]   that data than I am given that I just want this darn thing to work.
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:39.500]   And once I get it working, particularly if it's a networking thing where I'm lucky to
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.980]   just make sure that okay the port forwarding works.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.380]   I've been at this for three hours.
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.380]   I can access this from outside the office.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.620]   I don't care anymore.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:51.180]   I'm just going to go I'm just going to go home and just just chill out for a second
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.180]   there.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:57.060]   There's not everybody is going to be their experts on data security.
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.220]   Those people are paid for a lot of money because they are very, very smart and they
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.100]   know how to harden your data against intrusion.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:09.940]   I feel as though even giving my data to Google Drive makes it safer than relying solely on
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.140]   a box that I put on my own network that I'm responsible for configuring.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:19.460]   For all I for all I know I've just I've added a Wi-Fi extender to my office here.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.420]   For all I know there's some sort of default password that was not documented that I don't
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:28.500]   know about that will allow pretty much anybody to get in including the government.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.500]   Right.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.940]   They know that they know that well look this dope is has just been podcasting about how
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.340]   great it is that he's not using not trusting Dropbox or Apple anymore.
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:40.460]   He's got this box of his home network and now the whatever three letter agency is saying,
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.660]   oh that's great.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:46.740]   We don't need we don't need to warrant to take advantage of a box that he has willingly
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:53.060]   put on the internet but failed to fail to secure it successfully.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.740]   This would be difficult if he was actually using a free account on Google Drive but hey
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.060]   he's just given us his daily diary.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.540]   Well and his scooter exploits at our chatroom is very possible.
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:06.940]   It's even likely that if Apple did do and encryption would break a lot of functionality
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:11.580]   that we want things like sinking and the ability to log into your Apple account on the cloud
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:15.100]   and see your stuff and maybe they decided it's not worth that.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:19.260]   If you look at some of the services that have done that like crash plan and I think
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:27.060]   sugar sink one of one of spider oak one of those one of those spider oak yeah spider
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:33.620]   oak you have to you have to basically it creates a user barrier to because you have
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:38.500]   to generate your password your encryption key and use that.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:44.660]   And again you lose that key you literally no one's getting it back ever again and I
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:51.020]   think Apple has enough times also gotten stuff back for people that for them you know support
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:58.300]   has done this and they probably are not super happy about losing that capability as well.
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:02.300]   I think you know look for most people it's fine.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:06.060]   Even for me it's fine I you know I don't it's not too worried about it.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.620]   You need to make a statement.
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:11.260]   But I mean actually well again for me it's just my new game.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.260]   Yeah right.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:15.060]   So how secure can I make it a private can I make it this is what I'm going to use is
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:22.060]   a program called sandstorm.io which is a really interesting hosted platform it runs on Linux
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:29.460]   but it uses a really smart kind of encapsulization of all your data.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:33.020]   So they're really focused and you of course host it yourself.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.620]   Everything's encrypted and then you add apps it's kind of interesting because you add apps
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.420]   it has an app store.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:45.660]   So you add apps to you know add capabilities word presses an app for instance.
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.980]   There are a lot of apps in the I'll show you the app market.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:54.260]   The word processors every kind of Google Drive kind of similar capability drop box similar
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:55.260]   capability.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:24:00.420]   I'm really interested in replacing Evernote with this with PermaNote.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.180]   I think there's some very it's just to me this is going to be fun and by the way it's
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:10.060]   really costly I have to buy a server I'm going to host it myself I have to be have to have
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:14.620]   the technical ability to do that I also have to spend a significant amount of money on a
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:20.580]   wild card search so it's got HTTPS and who knows it could break all sorts of things could
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.940]   go wrong with it and there could be a massive hole in it.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:28.780]   So I know that I you know to me it's a game I'm going to do this for fun and out of kind
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.940]   of a journalistic interest.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.620]   How do you know if you've won?
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:37.060]   You only know if you've lost.
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:42.420]   I really love that attitude there are people who buy older cars not necessarily because
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:46.020]   they're cheap skates or not even necessarily because they think that the 1963 whatever
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:51.540]   was the car their dreams when they're when their dad talked about it but it's fun to
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:58.220]   have this this closed box that you will learn stuff about and it's insanely empowering when
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:03.420]   you get to yourself to a level of gameplay where you realize that I now know I know I
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:08.300]   feel as though I understand everything that's going on inside this inside this box I understand
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:13.220]   how all the software works I understand how this interacts with the other nobody is shielding
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:19.180]   me from with a with a wizard on how how how how this box now communicates with the rest
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:25.100]   of the world so now if something bad happens I know how to fix it and if you can do it it's
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:31.380]   fun and why not do it you know it's I'm a geek this is what I do for a living this is
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:37.060]   what I do for my hobby so of course I'm going to play with stuff like this but I understand
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:43.620]   that very few will or should have to so I welcome a company like Apple you know at least
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:48.060]   putting a flag in the sand and say work you know we're going to do this they need to and
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.380]   by the way there's no good mobile solution for this you know I mean you know if you want
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:58.340]   to carry a smartphone you're carrying a spy device with you you know just that's that's
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:04.340]   why I think that's why I know well that's well that's yeah and that's that's why I think
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.540]   that there's a there's a little how hardcore you can get about saying see this is why I
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:13.340]   use all Apple devices because of yeah but you're you're you're stepping outside into
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:18.420]   a world in which there are going to be devices that that could be just wheeled out in a public
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:24.220]   faces and capture all the phone data all the ideas we know they do that we know they use
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.220]   it and they don't and they and they gather every everybody's information not just the
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:35.460]   guy thereafter's information it's it's legal it's raining everywhere outside your house
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:40.380]   and trying to have the goal of being completely dry all the time is not an attainable goal
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.500]   the best thing to do is to make sure that the water is not going to hurt you a girl
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:48.500]   get you sick and oh and by the way I'm about to buy a car that if I do anything wrong the
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:53.740]   guy who runs the company will blog about it because he has all the telemetry from everything
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:27:06.260]   I do try and buy a private car I tell you let's say here what else so Apple did a song
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:12.620]   royalty rate proposal and I don't know enough about the business to know if this is good
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:21.780]   or bad or what Apple has an Apple be given its power in this industry probably will win
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:29.380]   Apple wants to set once every service that offers streaming music to pay 9.1 cents per
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:35.740]   hundred plays which seems like a weird way to say it but I guess you don't want to say
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:43.340]   point nine cents per players for an oh nine cents per play so that would be very straightforward
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:48.220]   it would also end free tears or if you did if you if spot if I had a free tear become
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:54.260]   straight out of their pocket at the rate of nine point one cents per hundred plays and
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:28:00.500]   in fact the New York Times says this is a direct attack at Spotify this has to be approved
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:08.300]   by the librarian of Congress I believe I'm not mistaken the copyright royalty board is
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:14.940]   oh I'm sorry is a panel of federal judges who oversee these rates in the United States
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.380]   it's apparently fairly complicated right now and musicians have a hard time figuring
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.740]   out what what they should be getting
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:29.900]   how many is this a flat text proposal yeah this is the flat text of the music world that's
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:36.980]   exactly what this is how many songs do you have to play in a month before you get you
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:43.340]   know up to a point where that's challenging a business model like some nine point we say
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:51.500]   nine cents for hundred songs so nine cents for every 300 minutes of streaming music
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:58.100]   seems like you'd have to play an awful lot of songs to um to cost apple or Spotify enough
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.740]   that your monthly membership wouldn't know but that's the point it would put them out
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:07.460]   of the free business and that's and that Spotify considers problematic oh there's no
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:15.780]   way chance to read and send some ads right yeah yeah yeah so and and you know it's interesting
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:22.220]   because when when apple did something Spotify considered any competitive earlier refusing
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:27.540]   to allow Spotify's app in the app store Spotify made a big deal about it they haven't said
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.500]   a word about this which makes me think that maybe they've come to some sort of agreement
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.500]   with Apple or I don't know maybe they gave up I think they're open to get bought I wouldn't
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:43.060]   be surprised if apple said you know we could just write you a check and if I were Spotify
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:48.500]   if I were Daniel I could be looking for check right now because this is a tough business
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:53.620]   but is apple the one to do that because they don't need them probably but they don't need
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:58.220]   them and then there's also a competitive issue maybe right maybe there's a lot there's title
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:04.140]   and you know there was a rumor that apple's trying to buy title right Jay Z's company
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:09.420]   so I was just looking I was curious what the CPM the cost per thousand is to advertise
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:14.860]   on Spotify and how that compares unfortunately it turns out you can't just find that information
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:20.820]   actually ask Spotify and negotiate so it'd be it'd just be interesting to see what how
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:26.260]   much Spotify actually makes on the ads and how that compares to the the whole 9.1 since
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:31.500]   I'm like 9.1 I mean if there's no more to pull a number out of a hat like nine or ten
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:36.220]   make ten sounds better doesn't it yeah I mean just really nine point one it's magic
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:42.860]   it's a magic yeah Jim and dal rimple I think we'll be happy he will be pleased apple has
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:49.700]   decided to take the audio fingerprint feature from iTunes match that apparently helps iTunes
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.420]   match from making mistakes although if you ask me they still make mistakes with iTunes
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:57.660]   match they're gonna bring it to their apple music they've also announced that they will
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:02.820]   no longer put DRM on your cloud music with apple music I'm not sure I didn't know why
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:08.100]   they were doing that in the first place so Jim who of course has been on the show many
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:13.180]   times he's at the loop in sight or sorry loop insight dot com was one of the people who
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:20.460]   complained that apple had deleted some of his music maybe this will make it better I
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:26.460]   don't know it's gonna be a real question but iTunes matches 25 bucks a year and apple
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:33.860]   music is 10 bucks a month so there's a big discrepancy there and I have a feeling that
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.620]   I will be I will be I wouldn't be surprised if I turn to music when away or iTunes match
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:42.180]   when away oh yeah that makes sense but as you start adding a match features to music
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:46.860]   precisely I mean they bring the audio fingerprinting they bring the other stuff suddenly 25 bucks
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:51.940]   a year was just too good a deal yeah yeah but that's there they're bringing this into
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:57.580]   solve a big problem it's it's really realize the thing that the third rail of this this
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:03.100]   adoption is trust us with your day trust us with your music library we will only screw
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:09.420]   it up kind of a little places as long as you don't have anything too weird in there you're
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:15.580]   gonna be good yeah I mean that's the best of albums the stuff you see advertised on TV
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:22.380]   everything will be fine K tell I get I want to happen to buy a second hand and a new copy
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:32.140]   of one of my favorite CD 2 CD set of the who's live tour in in 1989 and disc 2 is they play
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:37.340]   the entirety of Tommy from start to finish live I saw that tour by the way it was awesome
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:42.660]   got him I'm jealous it's just amazing amazing and when I'm I said a few weeks ago that I'm
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:47.260]   rebuilding my entire library and that's the time when I found out that at some point iTunes
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:54.780]   had melded this the live CD with like actual tracks from like the the studio album so you
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:33:00.020]   get like this incredibly dynamic like 1800 piece orchestra with 50,000 feet chanting and
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:07.540]   then do you think it's alright I want to wait a minute now so just just to make sure because
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:12.740]   I this is a this is a library that I'm not even letting iTunes ever see I just went and bought
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:17.860]   a second hand copy of it re-ripped it in in in a lack and so now I have it all like good
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:22.820]   good and intended so it's it's it's a problem they're gonna fix this oddly enough though my
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:27.100]   my opinion of Apple music has gone up quite a bit this is gonna sound like a backhanded
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:32.020]   compliment but it isn't once you make the decision that I'm never gonna let it have see my my
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:37.900]   actual owned library ever once you simply say this is a subscription music service that gives
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:43.740]   me curated playlist recommendations live radio and the ability to sample entire albums that's
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:48.900]   great it's a it's a really really superlative service and it might be the best the best monthly
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:55.260]   it's the only of the three different services that I have a lot of experience with not counting
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:34:00.300]   Amazon Prime because I'm gonna be buying Amazon Prime anyway I think that it's the one that
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:07.020]   I would keep if I had to only keep one between Spotify Google music and Apple music again given
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:13.260]   the rules that the this service will never ever ever ever even know where I hide all my music
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:19.740]   because I it's like it's like it's like when when mom or dad that they're great but when they drink
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:24.620]   just make sure you keep your homework books make sure you keep your bicycle heading away for them
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:30.220]   because something bad's gonna happen to it dad always takes the bicycle and goes and gets ice cream
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:36.180]   I will admit Andy that I think that's a good approach I mean I gave up in Apple music after the three
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:42.660]   month trial what do you use you Spotify I just modified I don't like Spotify particularly but I
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:50.460]   used RDO and I liked RDO a lot so Spotify's interface is ugly is sin and it really doesn't provide the kind
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.460]   of discovery and I just ran into this did you know there's a limit and how many tracks you can save
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:02.100]   I did not yeah I hit it I don't know what is the number though it must be pretty big yeah but but
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:06.780]   see the way at the way I way I like doing this was kind of doing the you know follow the path you
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:11.460]   know I start with a song I like so you would cash everything as you listen to you download it yeah
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:16.660]   well not download just just literally add to my songs list oh and there's a limit to that there's a
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.380]   limit to that well there shouldn't be a limit to that I can see how they might have a limit to how
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:24.860]   many you could download this is just literally adding to a list oh that's weird 10,000 or something
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:30.340]   must be a saw jeez you have a long that's a long list you could start a new list Adam you could have
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:35.060]   lists too well it's the thing is I don't know if it's playlists or if it's just literally my
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.860]   songs list oh I get it it's like really there's a limit I mean a thousand slow I mean most of these
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:48.260]   services 25,000 you know Google music I think it's more it's 50 yeah so Jim says this is the biggest
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:53.020]   change one of the most significant updates to kind of the service since it was introduced he says if
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:58.980]   you're currently an iTunes match an Apple music subscriber as he was you probably won't see much of a
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:03.500]   difference if you're but if you're an Apple music subscriber that doesn't have iTunes match you're
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:11.140]   gonna start to see matched as a check mark in the iCloud status column of your iTunes on your Mac so
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:18.220]   it's gonna start matching your music I love iTunes match I can live with that Apple music because like
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:24.860]   you I have Spotify also Google music but I love iTunes match and frankly it's the kind of thing you
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:32.020]   might just buy for one year match everything and then back it up I'm you know not to get back on
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:38.700]   this open source kick but one of the things that the Sandstorm server has is a music player and I'm
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:43.500]   gonna try putting all of the music I have on this cloud and then I could play it from the wack
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:49.700]   instrument from the web on my phone or anywhere else I really think that when the best investments
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:54.980]   you can make especially if you are if you have a family inside the house is to just spend $250
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:37:00.980]   or $500 on a NAS because they're there their cheap though the box itself only cost $100 200 bucks if
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:05.580]   you want to get like a family type one to put four terabytes or eight terabytes of storage is only
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:11.060]   another two or 300 bucks and every time you think about a solution that you need to have if you just
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:16.380]   go to the sun if you just go if you just log into your NAS and give you bring up the desktop and take a
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:21.380]   look at what's available for it you'll realize that oh there is actually an entire remote access I
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:26.380]   can basically build my own version of Apple music on this device at access and there there'll be
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:32.180]   Android apps it'll be Apple TV apps there'll be Roku apps and there'll be iOS apps what's missing my
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:39.100]   movies and music everywhere is Sonos and Amazon Echo and I've got to figure out a way that I can use a
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:45.780]   local source you know of music and use it and play it on my because I echo does Spotify now which
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:52.540]   is I mean actually always does but I don't know my default yeah well I do it by I buy I've paid for
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:59.580]   like the unlimited music storage on on Amazon and so I just have like a I don't know what the what the
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:07.020]   sync script is but just basically syncs my master library to Amazon music so it runs exactly so and
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:11.860]   because Amazon Echo of course is going to be intimate with the Amazon music library that's that's how I
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:17.220]   get working but yeah I really wish I could just simply point point my point my device it might I
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:22.620]   don't want to say it point Alexa at at the NAS and say this is where I want you to get music from
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:32.700]   from now on please Plex up yeah I think that'll happen yeah I'm loving the iOS 10 messages playing
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:38.660]   with it a lot I was able to convince my poor wife to switch to iOS 10 just so I could use it with
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:44.500]   her because otherwise I don't know anybody I can message her and Renee Richie but tough choice
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:49.940]   tough choice bad news they're not going to support those new things on Mac OS according to Mac world
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:57.980]   magazine yeah I think that there's a technical problem because the I haven't looked into it too
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:03.100]   carefully but isn't part of this whole deal that you know developers can make their own sort of
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:10.700]   additions to messages and I think it's all based on iOS touch stuff it's all based on UI kit which
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:17.500]   is not the AI is doesn't come over yeah right so unless Apple were to do some major thing you know
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:23.780]   as they've intermittently been rumored to do like somehow bringing UI kit to the Mac then I think
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:28.940]   that they couldn't just like flip a switch and say okay all this fancy stuff for messages now also
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:35.780]   works on the Mac I understand what you just said but I think the average user is gonna go what do
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:40.940]   you mean right what you're gonna get is descriptive text you know Leo sent you a message with
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:45.860]   exploding fireworks yeah I think it's a problem I mean to be honest and I think there's other
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:52.820]   problems they're actually kind of closing up the gap to a great extent you know things like Siri
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:59.860]   coming to the Mac but to the extent that you kind of can't do the same things on a Mac as you can on
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:04.780]   an iOS device when it makes sense I think that that's a that is a problem for Apple whether it's
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:12.140]   technical in nature or not doesn't really matter it is frustrating if you know something you that
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:17.740]   something that makes just as much sense to do on an iOS device or a Mac device if you can do it on
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:23.700]   one and not the other so I think that's a challenge they should try to sort of address over the years
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:27.940]   I think so how well they'll do it I mean that's one of the strengths of messages that I can sit down
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:35.020]   at a desktop or a laptop and continue the conversation and often I do that because I like the keyboard
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:47.220]   support is much easier than this on-screen tapping I agree I'm not gonna talk about the iPhone 7
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:53.620]   because it's not here yet it's not here yet so I'm not gonna talk about it it's not here yet and I'm
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:58.380]   not gonna talk about Pokemon go because I haven't been able to play all day
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:03.260]   down or something oh I thought you were just gonna say you haven't even been busy and so I know I'm
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:08.380]   trying to play right now what are you talking about yeah hey I got my priorities you know it's it's
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:12.820]   it's it's funny how many people thought that oh I can't believe that all these companies are wasting time
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:18.220]   on augmented reality and virtual reality Apple is so smart to not even like talk about messing with
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:23.900]   that but all you need is one app that everybody loves a yeah I think it is very pleased I could
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:29.820]   try out a hollow lens that may be kind of fun there is a Pokemon go hack that puts it on the
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:36.540]   hollow lens which might be really cool right Nintendo doesn't doesn't keep you from looking like a
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:42.100]   dork walking around a public park Nintendo has benefited oh no but so what you know because it
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:50.180]   doesn't matter because you got to catch them all and you look like it's like ash that's how you
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:58.660]   sell the hollow lens oh man this is just frustrating as heck I just I can't it won't by the way Nintendo is
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:11.340]   now more valuable than Sony Wow it's value has doubled because of an app so when you when you beat
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:17.260]   Twitter in two weeks yeah it's a little they get I will say that's impressive and I don't see any I
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:22.300]   don't know about where you guys are especially you Adam you probably don't have a lot of pokey stops in
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.900]   your neighborhood actually we're we have Cornell so yeah Cornell's are out anywhere there's a college
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:34.020]   yeah they've been sending out mail saying you really can't just go in any building you want some of
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:40.820]   them are off limits and you know oh man this is this might be this might be my age talking but I
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:46.260]   remember when I went to school it was really really hard to put myself through school but I could
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:51.780]   at least put myself through school I can't imagine how upset I would be as a parent say we're paying
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:59.620]   thirty eight thousand dollars a year thirty eight five sixty you are I'm talking about this I'm
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:05.860]   talking about the state's college I'm saying I know you're not going to spend any time looking
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:11.140]   for invisible pokey but you're gonna spend time figuring out how you can get a job and start paying
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:15.940]   us back for at least some of this is how it's always been Stephen King spent his entire college
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:23.060]   career playing hearts Bill Gates played bridge at Harvard from all years he was there and then he
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:27.300]   dropped out how did you think his parents felt man it's lucky he became the richest man in the
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.940]   world because otherwise just think if you had Pokemon go he never would have done done
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:37.460]   he played bridge kind of incessantly I'm told in college that was like non-stop and I remember
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:43.620]   there were a lot of people in college like that who just whatever whatever it was be it the bong
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:49.700]   be it the hearts they just didn't stop right that's all they did and I look at my son who has joined
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:54.900]   a frat and I do hope he's learned something in the four years and a hundred thousand dollars later
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:44:06.660]   number class it's beer then liquor ever so interesting to me about this Nintendo valuation
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:11.620]   thing Leo like you said they like doubled their their value or something they did that's based on
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:16.020]   ownership they only have thirty thirty three percent ownership of the Pokemon company you see
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:22.180]   thirty thirty percent ain't bad you see you see hey go but here's what's interesting I just this
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:28.020]   thought pops into my mind it seems like Nintendo got disproportionately more valuable than I don't
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.620]   know who else has I think more than 30 percent is Google well right doesn't I the niac the niac
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:38.500]   part of this it's a spun off from Google and Google has a big stake in niac and I don't know
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.940]   I said I don't know how they split their their money how the how the revenue is planned to be split
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:50.500]   on this but it just goes to show that just making the Pokemon brand sort of resurging value I guess
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:56.180]   is enough for people to just get excited about Nintendo yeah yeah well I think actually I mean
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:01.140]   to be fair the reason the stock market likes it first of all stock market is mercurial best right
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:05.300]   you know but the reason the stock market likes it is because they're Nintendo's was struggling
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:11.380]   with hardware and it shows that there is a path forward in software for Nintendo and that
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:16.660]   that what they have that's very valuable is their IP their intellectual property their characters and
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:23.060]   and those can be monetized so I think the stock markets probably saying oh they're you know we
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:28.420]   thought Nintendo was done and they're not speak okay let's also I'm talking about money and
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:38.180]   acquisitions arm whoa arm which of course was a spin-off of acorn computer the BBC computer
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:46.340]   they spun off arm apple put a huge chunk in it for the newton they needed a mobile chip apple was
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:53.380]   one of the founders in effect of arm and had a huge stake in that which they sold off arm powers
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:59.620]   almost every mobile you device you use your iPhone your iPad yes I know it's the apple a7
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:04.340]   but that's based on an arm architecture arm never made the chips arm only designed the chips and
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:11.060]   then licensed the design to companies like apple billions of chips a year in almost every smartphone
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:20.740]   just purchased by soft bank which I used to work for SunSan soft bank owns Ziff Davis briefly
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:26.740]   and when I was working for ZD TV 32 billion dollars
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:36.820]   the the founder of arm says it's a dark day for Britain wouldn't be the first one wouldn't be the
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:44.580]   first dark day for that half a week yeah but a soft bank has been at great pains and I believe
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:48.740]   this to say no you know what we're not taking any of the engineers out of Britain they're all
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:52.100]   gonna stay there the you're gonna the founders are gonna stay there the people running the company
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:57.140]   are gonna stay there soft banks become increasingly more like Berkshire Hathaway and a company that
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:04.020]   invests in companies so I don't think a SunSan has any desire or intention to bring arm to Japan
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:11.140]   nevertheless they now own and you know what if you if you put it this way they own the chip
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:17.220]   that powers all mobile computing and will tap power all internet of things 32 billion is a pretty
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:23.300]   good deal I think it's pretty interesting I don't know a ton about this but I know that
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:29.380]   Apple I think has an unusual deal with arms still even though they don't own any of it
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:37.140]   my memory is right they have a kind of unusual license that allows them to make their own chips
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:44.740]   to the arm spec so it sort of gives them an amount of freedom that I think most arm licensees
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:51.620]   don't have because they have to buy arm chips off the shelf from other other makers so I wonder if
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.620]   you know I wonder if that makes them like sweat a little less about things like major changes in
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:05.940]   ownership of of arm I don't know if any of you has any I mean I think Apple has been moving toward
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:10.180]   doing their own thing for a while anyway right they have more than a thousand chip designers
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:14.900]   working for right and I guess what's what's valuable about that license where I remember hearing
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:20.500]   about it is basically like they got that license at the right time in history where they're now I
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:27.140]   think empowered to continue making their own arm architecture chip regardless whereas like it might
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:32.340]   be one of those situations like the other comparison that comes to mind is a PDF like you know Apple
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:38.580]   got that PDF license really early on so they're able to integrate it into the OS and I think that's
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.940]   those kinds of licenses that some they own some of these licenses where I don't think if they went
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:47.620]   to the company now they'd get they'd get the license do you know if they get though from arm the new
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:53.860]   designs you know the A8 the A or whatever they call it the the Cortex-8 then as the new designs come out
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:59.140]   does Apple get those look at them and incorporate them into their chips or is it as Apple now on
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:05.780]   their own moving forward I don't know but my assumption would be that they have have some kind
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:10.420]   of like because I don't think this is a license and I'm I'm really speaking look no knowledge about
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:17.300]   this but it doesn't strike me that this is a license that has to be like perennially updated with new
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:23.300]   right you know arm stuff I think it's sort of like they they got something really really low level in
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:29.700]   the in the in the arm architecture where they you know they call it an architectural license so I
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:35.860]   think what it means is they are sort of allowed to parody it they're doing homage to arm yeah right
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:39.300]   well yeah they can adjust it or design their own other so I was just researching this too and
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:44.740]   you know an architectural license allows them to take the arm cores and adjust them so they you
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:49.220]   know most people would just be able to you know license the actual thing and use it and by the
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:54.500]   way Apple never mentions arm right I mean they don't say the A7 is based on the arm it's just yeah
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:58.740]   right and it's probably that architectural license that allows them to make a chip that
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:03.300]   completely complies with whatever it is they need from the arm architecture and does
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:08.420]   other stuff right I don't know having the the secure enclave and all this other
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:14.100]   Apple only junk which you certainly will be able to buy it was also a claim here that's Apple does
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.820]   not use arm designs they use certain principles present in the arm architecture in the ISA
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:24.500]   so it's almost a patent light it's almost as a level of you know you're not going to sue us for
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:29.620]   doing some of the same things you do at this point yeah maybe yeah I would bet that this
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:36.740]   doesn't really affect Apple except to maybe Hase in their desire to be armless they had there had
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:44.740]   been some discussion of Apple looking to acquire arm but that was about a year ago I feel like
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:52.100]   this is a good acquisition because how many IOT devices are on the horizon yeah you know Raspberry
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:58.100]   Pi uses arm every smartphone uses arm everybody uses arm yeah I think you're really onto something
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:04.580]   with the question of whether it's so much like a patent that other companies would be infringing
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:09.620]   just by using some of those principles right so yeah if there is that value to just owning
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:15.540]   the idea of an arm style architecture then certainly seems like seems like it's not going
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:22.980]   anywhere well it's okay because Apple has cornered the market on sensor equipped led smart jump ropes
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:30.500]   so that's going to be a huge business going forward wait till it's integrated with Pokemon
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:37.620]   Go be honestly believe it's the best punk of rope that's ever been made
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:44.580]   this is going to be you'll find him at Apple retail stores and online it's the tan gram
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:49.700]   smart rope it uses magnetic sensors attached to ball bearings in the handles to count every jump
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:56.180]   sending it to your iPhone and your Apple watch and you can see really bad graph in the health
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:02.740]   yeah and 23 LEDs are built into the rope which flash thousands of times per minute to create
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:09.140]   an animated effect in mid-air oh well that's cool so this will be a new olympic sport in four years
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:16.340]   you want to see the video let's let's watch the evolution of a classic jumping rope right
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:18.740]   isn't that a good exercise is what boxers do right
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:28.580]   uh what's that oh my god it's it's oh my god so the LEDs are projecting the number of jumps onto
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:34.500]   the wall in front of you no no it's it's persistence of vision well whatever whatever
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:39.140]   basically whatever it looks like they're on the wall it's oh i see you're seeing
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:43.700]   it's like you ever seen those other things where you have a bank of LEDs that spins yeah
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:48.180]   there you go yeah you're seeing the rope because you're seeing it at a corner your eye pretty cool
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:55.540]   yeah that's cool all right i'm i mocked it i was wrong opera has just been sold to a child this is
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:02.580]   bad the opera browser to a chinese consortium for six hundred million dollars the Norwegian
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:11.300]   company sold the browser the performance apps the name by by opera it's not the biggest browser in
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:16.660]   the world although mobile they have a you know they have a decent uh percentage i think uh what let
[01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:22.980]   me see it was in the article here it's small on the desktop desktop like one yeah so tens yeah right
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:32.260]   all right i think i'm done do you want to talk about apple pay touch id coming to 70 000
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:39.380]   atms across the us i think we talked about that last week didn't we did we uh yeah that's good
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:45.540]   that's good that's enough just to mention all right let's uh unless somebody has something they want
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:49.300]   to talk about we can move on and get our picks of the week yeah i'm happy
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:55.060]   jenny oh this is a new feature the show where we ask are you happy
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:04.580]   intersection time i'm happy you're happy are you happy adam and rank your happiness before
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:11.060]   the show on a scale of one to ten how much pain are you if you ever seen that the the one to ten
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:16.340]   the real one to ten pain scale that a cartoonist did no oh this is fabulous because if you look at the
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:20.500]   ones in the hospital it's like you know you have to get up to three or four before the the face isn't
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:26.500]   smiling um you know whereas i think any pain is did this you can find it while i'm talking it's just
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:32.260]   a look to your peccar is that i think so basically the last one is like a bear is eating my entrails
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:40.740]   it's got to be xkcd right it's uh it's a bear is eating my entrails
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:48.020]   i can't i can't make any sense where you're eating it's it's much much more accurate
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:51.540]   what for those who actually have had pain you know from surgeries or what not you're trying to
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:55.620]   report to the doctors like well you know it's like someone's hitting me in the head with a blunt
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:01.860]   instrument you know or it is xkcd or maybe not but here's an xkcd that's yeah yeah that this isn't
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:07.380]   it but there's another one that's better but yeah all right but yes it's uh it's pretty impressive
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:12.260]   all right let's take a break ladies and jettled but
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:17.460]   we'll have your picks of the week at a bit but first get ready to get hungry because i'm
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:22.980]   gonna talk about blue apron blue apron's mission statement you ready

[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:47.460]   time for our picks of the week let's start with india not cohere
[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:53.300]   i've been really excited about this since i started beta testing it earlier earlier this year
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:59.460]   finally uh scrivener my favorite word processor is coming to ios it's gonna be released
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:04.100]   uh we're recording on tuesday the 19th it's gonna be released tomorrow the 20th
[01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:07.700]   uh and they've done a whole blog post about it at literature and latte the website so i can
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:13.060]   talk about it uh and it's just amazing now it's always been my favorite word processor because
[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:18.500]   it's not just here is a document and write your document and then print it or email at someplace
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:25.700]   it's always been for the the best word processor for writing projects such as a whole novel a
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:30.580]   whole nonfiction book i've written a couple of different like an entire like four or five
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:35.860]   hundred page textbooks uh entirely in scrivener uh if you're doing like a thesis paper where it's
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:40.100]   not just the stuff that you're writing chapter after chapter after chapter but it's also all
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:45.060]   the research that you're doing and all the outlines you're making and all the random scraps of notes
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:50.740]   this is the no other app can tie all this together into one nice organized pile like scrivener can so
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:56.180]   it's always been like my go to app for for the mac uh and this is they've spent a couple of years
[01:59:56.180 --> 02:00:02.180]   trying to make an ios version of it and they did an entire restart of it last year and what they
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:07.220]   wound up with is an app that is one of the most beautiful one the most powerful apps that's ever
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:13.060]   been made for ios i think uh it really does i'm unfortunately i've been liking it so much that
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:19.060]   even in beta i've been doing like real work with it so i can't really show you like all i can't really
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:23.300]   show you the real app because a lot of this is like kind of like secret stuff that i can't really
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:29.460]   show you he's novel oh no something stuff it's not ready to show yet but it means for us to do a lot
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:33.940]   of research on you might have heard me talk about this piece of piece of art that i'm doing research
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:38.180]   on and this has to really live as a scrivener doc because i know that i'm going to write something
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:43.780]   about it and i'm writing actually notes and stories as they come to me and actually come coming up with
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:48.660]   data only like scrivener will allow me to put this in this really nice and you can't really see it at
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:52.420]   there again i should have i should done a screen capture me we'll do it later on but
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:59.460]   only only scrivener lets you do stuff like i have an entire folder here called research
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:06.740]   that i can tap on and uh i can get every single every single piece of research by topic uh in a
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:13.620]   hierarchy here uh stuff that isn't really something i've written yet uh can be things like uh i've a
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:20.420]   photo call photo just for folder just for photos so i can tap on that and see now all the stuff that
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:26.740]   i've been finding online on my ipad and just drill down and just see all the stuff that i've been
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:31.780]   finding it so i've got it someplace nice and organized so that when i need to refer back to it uh it'll
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:37.540]   work for it'll work really really nicely uh and it's a really really studly ios app it does support
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:44.420]   script it does supports split screen so i can have my scrivener research while i'm in safari someplace
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:52.420]   else or while i'm doing uh doing uh reading stuff elsewhere and it syncs beautifully to the desktop
[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:58.260]   version of scrivener for mac it uses dropbox as a conduit i don't think they're support uh i have
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:02.580]   to double check i'm not sure if they're actually supporting any other uh cloud services yet
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:07.380]   oh just drop yeah just just dropbox i don't know if they changed it since the last time
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:13.620]   i checked the notes uh but it's really just it makes me want to it makes me love the fact that i
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:19.460]   bought my ipad pro it makes me love the fact that i decided that scrivener was the best word processor
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:26.020]   on the planet for me several years ago and it's just another reason why i can keep my my macbook pro
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:32.260]   at home uh and just use this even if i didn't even as a matter of fact even if i weren't using it uh
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:38.180]   on the on the mac or on windows i feel as though this would be a great thing even to use just as a
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:46.500]   standalone app on ios now there are uh other there's a an app that's not kind of in the same category
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:54.900]   it's called eulisies that will also let you organize uh files by folder and project what i like to say
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:03:00.900]   is that uh eulisies is they both have the same kind of attitude eulisies is very very simple
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:05.300]   which means that you will be able to get it and exploit get it all the power out of it almost
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:10.340]   immediately but it is limited to pretty much just text files you can't really format things
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:15.860]   you can't really export everything from there and make it into a book for instance or put it into
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:21.060]   something uh like word or something something bigger like that or at least not very easily
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:26.260]   a scrivener or something that you won't you'll use it at a very basic level for the first month
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.940]   and then when you start realizing oh wait what am i using an outliner for it i think they're
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:34.020]   supposed to be an outliner here and then you start thinking in terms of oh wait here's all
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:38.180]   here are all these features that i could be taking advantage of that for organizing my my data
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:42.980]   organizing my thoughts plotting things out i have i do have a couple of novels in scrivener
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:47.940]   and a lot of them just simply start off as an empty scrivener project with just simply one note
[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:53.140]   card that has the entire story in two sentences and then i figure well actually this it'll end i
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:57.620]   don't know what happens after that but it ends like this so there's another note card that simply
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:02.980]   says the ending and then two months later i've got a complete outline many scenes all written out a
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:09.620]   couple chapters actually written and scrivener allows me to organically figure out where this
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:15.940]   piece of writing is going a lot it really is beautifully tilled and cultivated soil to grow ideas in
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:20.100]   so can't speak highly enough of it it's going to be available starting tomorrow from literature
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:27.060]   and latte and i believe also the the ios app store uh 20 bucks worth it i really want to put
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:31.620]   put up but i have i have a free version of it but this is the sort of thing where i'm
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:36.340]   basically going to definitely be sending them real money because i want them to have money for
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:43.300]   this like i said it's if if apple does not feature this on the app store and actually the next uh
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:48.340]   and the next time they talk about the ipad give people a demo of this to show how beautiful an
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:52.500]   app that's intended for a large screen can be uh they're kind of silly it'll also work on the
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:57.700]   iphone by the way uh but uh on the on the ipad it really stretches its legs i'm you can tell by
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:05:02.900]   by tone of voice really excited about this because i've i've never i'm i'm the guy who tells you don't
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:07.940]   entrust real data and real projects to beta software but there was such a lack of anything
[02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:13.860]   even similar to this for the ipad that i'm like uh to help with the anti-i'm gonna start i'm gonna
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:16.580]   start developing this project the ipad instead because i like scrivener too much
[02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:27.060]   scrivener for io x s and o s x and windows 10 of all things uh daniel you got to pick something you
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:32.100]   want to highlight tell us about i have a pick for you and you know i like to promote um
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:37.940]   indie software developers the little guys right so i have one from verizon wireless
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:45.060]   which is the setup there you have the software that uh the software that came to mind because i
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:53.780]   recently traveled to uh england for two weeks and this is a problem that you may be familiar with
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:59.700]   if you ever travel internationally and you refuse to pay the exorbitant roaming fees of your carrier
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:03.780]   um of course if you have an unlocked phone more and more of us do these days
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:10.100]   you just buy one of these cheap sim cards in uh countries country or countries you're visiting
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:15.940]   and then you have this challenge because from that point forward you can't get any of your sms
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:20.100]   messages which isn't really a problem if you're doing things like iMessage or using
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:25.380]   WhatsApp or Snapchat or whatever other way you have of keeping up with your friends but it is a
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:30.660]   problem for um especially things like two-factor authentication you want to log into twitter or
[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:37.380]   something if you've got two-factor authentication setup it wants to um text you a code and um this
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:42.580]   has always been really anxiety inducing for me when i travel because i i really don't want to pay
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:49.300]   the outlandish data fees but um there's no way i thought there was no way to continue getting my
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:55.940]   sms messages while on the run and um the truth is this i have to hand it to Verizon not only does
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:07:02.980]   this message plus app on the uh on the iTunes app store not only is it you know free not only does
[02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:08.660]   it do what it says which is bring um you know sms messages to my attention even when i don't have
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:15.140]   my Verizon sim card installed um but it's actually you know it seems to actually kind of work well
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:20.660]   and it you know would do things like pop up uh on my um you know notifications would come through
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:25.540]   instantly i tested it a few times before i left and you know texting myself and they pop up instantly
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:32.340]   um it's funny when you install it it tries to encourage you to turn off iMessage which is just
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:37.700]   a dumb idea but um you know because you do want to keep your iMessage if you have uh relationships
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:44.180]   that you know chats with people by iMessage but what's great about this app is it just fills that
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:50.420]   that hole where you could no longer get sms anymore on your native you know telephone number
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:56.980]   um so i recommend this to anybody who has Verizon and is planning to leave the country and you want
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:08:02.180]   that flexibility to be able to buy a sim card um and i i wonder if you know i i haven't researched
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:06.660]   because i'm not an AT&T customer but i wonder if um there's something similar it's worth looking
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:11.620]   into because i don't know have you guys ever done that left the country and then suddenly
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:16.180]   realize you don't have your sms or do you usually just kind of try to get by on Wi-Fi
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:21.540]   etc and bear it on the damn data plan the damn data plan right to google phy baby get google
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:26.100]   phy you won't ever have to worry about this it has uh it's amazing you get the full you get your full
[02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:34.100]   service everywhere you go yeah but then i wouldn't get my iMessage's oh that oh that yeah that's just
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:38.980]   a little thing called uh platform lock-in yeah well you were gonna get your you weren't gonna get
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:45.140]   right messages anyway just give it a right oh i know you like it when the when the emojis can't
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:52.500]   really be really big what do you what do you got for us uh adam inks well i'm gonna go for something
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:09:00.420]   that uh that's that's well everyone has it um preview yeah it's in your applications folder it's
[02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:06.260]   awesome and preview we started Josh Sunner's start managing and i started writing some articles
[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:13.460]   about preview and the deeper we got into it the more we just kept saying my goodness do this app
[02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:19.700]   has so many features it's it's incredibly deep um i mean did you know you can open hundreds of
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:24.100]   images in a single window you can trash them with a keystroke you can move images and you know
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:32.100]   with it from within preview you can play slideshows of pdfs if you want it um you can even edit an
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:39.060]   image live while looking at the original version of the image it's just it's amazing what preview
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:47.380]   can do people have no idea um and uh say we wrote this bunch of tidbits articles and then we actually
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:53.460]   got requests for this so we have just turned into control of preview control of preview wow wow
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:58.500]   wow that's awesome let me tell you you wouldn't think that you could write 166 pages about preview
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:03.380]   until you get into the app you're like holy cats it can import from scanners it can import from
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:10.980]   your iphone you know it can it can put uh encryption both types of password encryption on your pdfs
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:16.660]   all sorts of things we were just just shocked at how capable this app is i sort of want to i want
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:23.060]   to know who are the developers and apple behind preview because this is a truly classic map app
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:29.860]   yeah it has a ton of keyboard shortcuts they all make sense you know control command a gives you
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:35.220]   an arrow instantly you know stuff like that where it's like once you've learned them the app is
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:41.940]   is just it's just brilliant and there's things that you don't think about like um uh when you're
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:47.060]   at it working on an image all your all the things you add to it are in layers and you can't control
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:53.140]   the layers it's not photoshop but you can by duplicating and then you know duplicating something
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:57.380]   and then erasing the or deleting the original one you can actually change the order of the of the
[02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:01.940]   layer so if you want to overlay something there's all these techniques we figured out while writing
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:07.940]   this book and um i just want to encourage people to play with preview because man does this app
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:13.780]   have features very nice it's one of those things that we've had it for so long we just kind of take
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:18.740]   it for granted so it's nice to be reminded of all things it can do i mean just you know context
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:23.460]   sheet view thumbnails view you can collaborate you can annotate a pdf and then go through in the
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:29.780]   sidebar all the annotations right there how much are those taken for all books 15 bucks and you
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:34.180]   find them on iBooks or would you rather i go to tidbits well i would rather i'm not gonna be
[02:11:34.180 --> 02:11:38.900]   sure i'll show you about this i'd rather be bothered for me um the fact is it doesn't make any
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:43.700]   difference you know and the ratings or anything in iBookstar so um you buy them from us then we can
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:48.420]   much more easily send email when there's free updates whenever so actually so you saw that picture
[02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:52.740]   i had on the on the web page i learned two new techniques that i are not in the book while doing
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:56.820]   that picture oh that's a story i have to do a free update and give that to everyone that's hysterical
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:12:02.580]   adam angst thank you always a pleasure and now i'm going to have you close your eyes if you're
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:10.260]   watching and listen to these sounds and see if see if anything comes to you
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:20.100]   it's sesame street as a dim a dim memory from your past monochrome monochrome graphics flash
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:27.060]   this is a test of how long you've been using a mat
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:35.700]   if you hear that that sound and you get chills i know you're an old timer this is a great game
[02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:40.980]   isn't it dark castle we love the game i'm gonna i'm gonna read some names see if you see if you're

[02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:17.380]   book about it you know early mac shareware developers because there's it was just such a
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:22.260]   wonderful vibrant scene before that gd mac app store came along
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:28.500]   hey you know i wanted to add one more thing about sure that classic games on the mac thing um
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:33.380]   something i noticed a few months ago was that that one in one of the names listed there was glider
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:38.020]   yeah you know john alhoun love jac who has a lighter so uh for anybody who's technically ambitious
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:44.100]   with source code you should know that glider's source code is completely available on github um
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:49.380]   oh my god searching for that and i poked around at it and it's not trivial to get building or
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:54.340]   anything um because it's all it's all old is it pascal what's it written yeah i think it was
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:16:01.140]   c but it's all old carbon uh c stuff so you kind of have to you know you have to this is going to
[02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:05.460]   be somebody's fantasy project to pursue but it's kind of cool even just to look at it and be able
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:11.860]   to download uh and see you know how this classic mac game was organized in source code so i guess
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:18.020]   it's i guess it's from john right is but his handle is soft dorothy yeah i think that's him
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:25.220]   yeah um and uh and yeah look he's got all kinds of stuff up there um but you see that uh mcp
[02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:31.060]   for instance file extension that's like a um metro works like if she's metro works that was
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:37.620]   this that was a great c compiler yeah boy i loved metro works kept the mac alive i'd say for yeah
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:44.340]   oh man i wrote so much stuff and then i love it was fast had a great i de i man there's a blaster
[02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:50.900]   that i forgot about metro works yep i loved that uh any anaco chicago sun times always a tip of the
