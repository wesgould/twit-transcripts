[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.540]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers,
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.500]   all the Apple News and boys and Apple News this week.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.860]   Joining me right now from, I guess, from the shelter is Andy
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.760]   and Aco.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.400]   I hope everything's OK in Boston.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.800]   It's OK.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.240]   In New England, we mostly-- the hurricane mostly
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.440]   passed us to the West.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   So there are a lot of communities that are without power,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.600]   which includes my area.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   The real bad story was, obviously, it's just geography,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.800]   geography, geography, up in Vermont.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.960]   For instance, there has just been massive flooding.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.320]   A lot of people just now completely homeless.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.880]   And there have been some lives lost.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.680]   So although I might be a little let's see today,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   because it's been three days since I've been
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.040]   able to actually have a real workday, that's kind of OK.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.840]   We got up OK.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.120]   It's tough not to have power for that long.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.560]   That's a long time.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.400]   Today, I know that a lot of our viewers
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.880]   are New England raccoons and badgers.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.720]   So I'm saying that if you go to the dump, like in my town,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.280]   you'll find five really premium rising crust frozen pizzas,
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.160]   not from the store, but from a restaurant.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.960]   So just make sure that the supreme pizzas--
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   the churro is a little bit spicy.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.600]   So if you're going to start with that,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.040]   you might want to go a little easier,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.840]   or you're going to have a little bit of a rumbly
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   tummy frozen today.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.640]   So I'll say the sausage ones, that's OK.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   But enjoy those.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.360]   I plan to over the next month and a half, but I guess.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.640]   As long as I can support local wildlife, I'm OK.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.040]   Well, I hope you get back at home.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.480]   I know you could be in your home.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.160]   You just don't have any power in your home.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.240]   It was like that scene in Animal House
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.480]   where Bluto watches that guy trip and fall
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.200]   and dump that entire case of Scotch.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840]   Like, ah, no.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.480]   The pizzas are defrosting.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.160]   Well, we're glad you made it fine.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.400]   And we do send out our hopes and prayers
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.560]   for the people who are suffering.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.920]   You know, it's funny because my sister, who lives in Cranston
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.880]   Rhode Island, went to Maine for her vacation, perhaps thinking
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.680]   she might avoid the effects of the hurricane.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   And I don't know.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.960]   Maybe it followed her.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.320]   I don't know.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.720]   Anyway, we do hope everybody's OK.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.600]   I know my mom is-- I think my mom probably still has a hazard
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.800]   but doesn't have her power either in Cranston.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.280]   Is that a spare bedroom?
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.080]   She can stay-- yes, she does.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.120]   She actually does, and very good high quality internet.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.920]   Yes.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.360]   I've always liked your big mom.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.000]   Nice, nice, great person.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.600]   Very lovely.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.840]   The mom.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   Also joining us, it's the body and hair of Breen, Chris Breen,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   Mac Daddy from Macworld Magazine, Macworld.com.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.640]   Hey, Chris, how are you today?
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.480]   I'm well.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.160]   I have power.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.240]   I'm on the west coast.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   All right, we're OK.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.560]   I'm fine.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.400]   Yeah, we're just watching.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.480]   Hurricane Irene did not make it this far.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   No, thankfully.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.680]   No.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.200]   So were things like crazy on Thursday at Macworld
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.240]   with the Steve Jobs announcement?
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.440]   Yeah, it was big news.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.400]   Scramble.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.640]   Yeah, when it broke-- because we have staff on the east coast
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.360]   as well as on the west coast, Wednesday, when the news broke,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.720]   suddenly the east coasters were getting calls on the red phone
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.920]   saying, your workday is not over yet.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.280]   So let's get to it and start writing about it.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.520]   So we've produced a ton of stories about Steve and his past
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.320]   and where things are going and probably a lot of the same things
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   that you've been talking about.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.120]   Yeah, Andy, Enocho joined me and Tom Merritt and Alex Lindsey.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.800]   We talked about it.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.880]   We went to a live breaking news, of course, when we got the news.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.400]   And it was hard not to be kind of elegiac about it,
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.840]   to kind of to eulogize Steve Jobs, even though, of course,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.000]   he's still alive, still.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.960]   In fact, chairman of the board of Apple,
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.000]   how much do you think Jobs will be running things?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.800]   I know not day to day, but how much input
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.880]   is he going to have going forward?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.320]   I still think he's going to be lead dog.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.720]   I still think he will still have the ability to say,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.960]   no, we're going to be going towards that mountain, not
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.400]   that mountain over there.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   But I'm not sure that from the reports
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   that we all have been reading that he's
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.880]   going to have the same amount of influence that he once had.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, there are no end to the list of stories
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   of tiny, tiny little details that Mr. Jobs got himself involved
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.400]   with, like the colors of screens,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.120]   that sort of metal fittings that would be holding pieces
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.720]   of glass together in an Apple store, all that sort of stuff.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.920]   I think that era has passed.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.040]   But I think that if Tim Cook read that Onion parody article
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.840]   and said, you know what?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.080]   I think we should start getting into printers.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.960]   I think that at that point, Jobs would raise his hand
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.520]   and say, yeah, no, you're not.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.960]   He's still involved.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.600]   Vic Gundotra, Google+ told a great story.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.960]   He was in charge of all of Google's mobile apps.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.680]   And he says that he was at religious services
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   when his phone rang, a number he didn't recognize,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.200]   so he didn't answer it.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.320]   Immediately afterwards, he checked his messages.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.880]   And it was, hi, Vic, this is Steve Jobs.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.480]   I've got an urgent issue to discuss with you.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.120]   Please call me as soon as you get this message.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.160]   Vic did, explained to Steve that he was at religious services,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.240]   which was why he didn't pick up.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.120]   And Steve laughed and said, well, unless the echolardee says,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.720]   God, you probably shouldn't pick up during religious services.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.920]   But then goes on to say, I have a problem
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.040]   with the yellow gradient in the O of Google on one of your apps.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.960]   I've assigned a designer to fix it, if that's OK with you.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.800]   And we'll just move forward if you don't mind.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.440]   And that's just an example of how I mean talk about the gradient,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.320]   the yellow gradient in the O wasn't quite right.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.840]   And usually, that's a mark of a guy who's a total jerk who
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.320]   has no idea what's going on, but wants to be able to say,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   you know that problem with that yellow--
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.760]   I'm the only person who saw that.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   So you're welcome.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.120]   It's good when you have someone who is big picture,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.280]   but also--
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.320]   You know that he's looking at little details like that.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.400]   And the stories like that are coming out from everywhere.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.560]   Chris, you probably have some Steve Jobs stories as well to tell.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.080]   What do you think Steve's impact will be going forward with Apple?
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.280]   You know, one person said, I thought this was kind of interesting,
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.600]   that Apple will be just fine for the next five years or so.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.080]   But who's going to come up with the next category
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.680]   definer?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.800]   In other words, they can coast along great with the iPhone,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.600]   the iPad, the Macintosh.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.360]   They can continue to do what they're doing with iTunes.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   But who's going to be the person that says, what's the next iPad,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.280]   the next big new innovation?
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.560]   That's what Steve did, isn't it?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.640]   Well, I think that's one of the things that Steve did.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.960]   He certainly wasn't the guy who went home and worked on his garage
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.840]   every night and manufactured something and brought it back.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.640]   But I do think he was the guy that people would bring stuff to.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.440]   And Steve would say, no, into the lion's den for you.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.320]   And maybe, but I want to tweak the following things.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.720]   And then they pass it down and bring it back when it's ready
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.440]   and you've done what I've asked.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.400]   But I think what we've seen a lot in the evolution of Apple
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.880]   is that we've seen products that have changed and mutated over time.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.120]   So you can see the connection from going from an iPod,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.560]   then to the iPhone.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.400]   And certainly from the iPhone to the iPad and the iPod Touch.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.360]   You can see they're starting to move in a touch interface
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.200]   into the Mac OS.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   So what does that mean then for the next generation of Macs
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.720]   or the generation pass it?
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   Or for multimedia devices, if they're going to get into something
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.000]   like a television set?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.360]   So how is the big rumor?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.120]   Yeah, yeah, that they might do that.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   Right, because I think I look at lion.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.560]   And I don't know about you guys, but I don't use it all the time
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.800]   because I'm mostly a mouse guy.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.080]   But I have to think there's got to be another shoe that drops
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.200]   of this thing because I don't fully understand what the big deal
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.760]   is about touch on the Mac OS.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.880]   Unless I can actually touch a device so that I remove
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.600]   that level of abstraction where I'm touching a trackpad
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.400]   under actually touching the device as I can with my iPad.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.240]   As far as Steve's involvement, I think it really
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.080]   depends on why he's left and how he's feeling.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.160]   Because if it's really about his health, who knows how much
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.000]   effort he can put into it.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.560]   If it's simply that it was time and he couldn't realize
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.600]   his obligations to his level of satisfaction,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   certainly he's going to be standing up there
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.640]   or sitting in the big seat and saying, no, I like that.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.320]   But he has to give Tim Cook room to breathe, too.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.960]   He can't very well come out for the next iPhone
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   and say, hey, look, I'm back.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.000]   Because it's like, well, when does Tim really become the guy?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   And so I think at this point, publicly, Steve Jobs
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.520]   definitely has to step back.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.960]   I mean, I don't think that you can't discount the fact
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.120]   that Apple has one of the strongest executive teams in tech
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.000]   or maybe in corporate America.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.880]   It's not just the one guy who's giving the orders
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.920]   and people carrying them out.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.880]   It's also an executive team.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.920]   We're all on the same page.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.840]   The more questions I ask, the more convinced I am
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.280]   that they work extremely cohesively so much so that, yeah,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.360]   I wonder if they're just really, really good at lying
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.120]   about how well they work together.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.920]   Because you don't have that sort of infighting
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.680]   that you would not have at Apple a case where one executive
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.280]   team decides to cancel a tablet product.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   Meanwhile, the manager of the OS that runs on
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.840]   is unaware of that and keeps working on the next version of the OS.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.160]   That would never happen at a company like Apple.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.360]   But I think the only question that's left in my mind
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.880]   is we are going to see exactly how--
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.040]   we are going to see evidence of exactly what influence Steve
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   used to have.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.720]   Because my picture has always been that Apple can do Batman,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.800]   the character, without Steve Jobs.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.640]   But with Steve Jobs, the guy who said that-- if a script came
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.680]   across and said, have Batman firing guns
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.840]   into a crowd of people think, no, Batman would never do that.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.720]   You can't do that.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's not Batman.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.280]   That's not the product we're doing.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.240]   Because Apple has always been about--
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.000]   I keep coming back to this again and again,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.520]   so I'm sorry if I keep repeating myself.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.080]   But I really do believe that they see their product line
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.120]   as characters in a story they're going to tell.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.240]   I think that everyone of the company
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.800]   knows these characters and knows the story.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.520]   And if someone tried to veer off into a different direction,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.440]   it would get squashed.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   But we're going to see proof of concept of that
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.680]   in the next two or three years.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.680]   Let's talk about Tim Cook a little bit.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.400]   He, of course, is the new CEO of Apple Computers.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   He's been there for 12 years.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   Prior to joining Apple, he was vice president
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.440]   of corporate materials at Compaq, procurement
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.800]   and management of all of Compaq's product inventory.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.720]   Before that, he was an intelligent.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.920]   This is a guy who is all about supply chain.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.120]   In fact, it's pretty clear that he's the guy
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.800]   who's made it possible for Apple to make millions and millions
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.120]   of phones and tablets, corner the market and flash,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.400]   things like that.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   This guy is absolutely an operations guy.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.560]   That's what he did.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.720]   He was the COO.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.440]   Apple's awarded him a million shares of Apple stock
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.480]   and guaranteed that he will be at Apple for--
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.080]   what did they say?
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.600]   It was another eight years, 10 years.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.960]   What do you-- Chris, do you know anything of Tim Cook?
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.520]   I don't know much except his history.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.840]   And as you suggest, one of the big things he did is--
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.120]   during that period when Apple was just all over the map,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.080]   he-- Steve brought him in.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.520]   He came in and he looked at manufacturing.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   And Apple had its own manufacturing plants.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.240]   And he said, well, this makes no sense.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.880]   We're spending an enormous amount of money
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.640]   to produce stuff.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.120]   We have too much inventory.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.480]   We need to streamline this.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.800]   So he's a deficiency guy.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.560]   He came in and said, OK, these plants are closed.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   We're not going to do that anymore.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   We're going to outsource this stuff to these manufacturing
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.000]   plants in China.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.800]   We're going to keep very careful watch on this stuff.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.160]   And it made a big difference so that they didn't have
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.680]   a bunch of inventory sitting around every so often.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.080]   They're a little short on inventory.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.840]   But in some ways, that actually reflects well on Apple.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.520]   They show, we can't make enough of these iPads
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   because everybody in the world wants them.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.880]   So I think having somebody who is that detail-oriented,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.320]   where they're that efficient, was certainly
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.720]   part of Steve Jobs' job.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.920]   And so in that sense, he's a good guy to have in there.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.800]   The question is, does he have the artistic eye that Steve has?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.680]   And at this point, we just don't know.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.440]   I'm looking at the executive profiles on the Apple site.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.080]   These are the nine middle-aged white guys
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.320]   who run Apple computer.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.760]   Scott Forstall arguably not quite middle-aged yet.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.600]   Yeah, I think he would argue with that middle-aged one.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.240]   He's the youngest of the bunch.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.120]   He's in charge of iOS.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.200]   You've got Johnny Ive, who is absolutely
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.440]   the best industrial designer out there.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.120]   There's no question about that.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.360]   Ron Johnson, who is in charge of retail right now,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.120]   will leave for JC Penney's in a couple of months.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.400]   We met Bob Mansfield.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.480]   He's the senior vice president of Mac Hardware Engineering
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.320]   when that unibody came out.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.560]   Of course, we all know Phil Schiller.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.240]   He's their marketing guy.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.160]   But I look at this crew as good and competent as they all are.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.760]   You don't see a standout who's--
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   you don't see a Steve Jobs or even a Bill Gates or Jack Walsh
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.920]   or anybody who could just kind of step up and say,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.960]   I'm going to lead this company into the 21st century.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.920]   No, but maybe that's OK.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.440]   I've been thinking that in five years' time,
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.360]   even if Steve were still the CEO of Apple,
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.680]   it might have been a good idea for him to step back
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.600]   as that face of Apple.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.080]   Because I think even this week, we're seeing the problem
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.000]   of when the entire public associates one person with one
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.240]   company, what happens when Apple Computer resigns itself?
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.160]   It's amazing how many emails that I
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.240]   was getting for the first two or three days from people
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.040]   who were asking, is Apple going to be OK?
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.400]   As if the breadwinner of a family of three had just died.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.440]   Which is absolutely not the case.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.240]   So I think that I would be very, very pleased if Tim Cook did not
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.280]   take the center spotlight in upcoming events,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.400]   that if they let that spotlight just be whatever
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.560]   the next thing is, because Apple shouldn't be about anyone
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.400]   person, Apple historically has always
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.760]   been about whatever that next thing is.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.600]   It's just so hard to disentangle Apple from Steve Jobs.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.000]   I mean, and the one time that it happened,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.040]   the eight years or whatever that Steve was wandering
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.160]   in the wilderness with Next and Pixar,
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   Apple didn't do so well.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160]   It did not fare well.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.080]   And Jobs, it's interesting, because Jobs came back
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.160]   a changed man.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.800]   I would say that those years running Next, which
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.640]   was arguably a failure, and Pixar, which was obviously
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.840]   a success, he learned, I think, to be a true leader.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.240]   Instead of the pirate running up the flag on the Macintosh
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.000]   building, he really came back and took charge big time
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.880]   in that company, made the deals probably that were
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.360]   repugnant to him, but that he had to make with Microsoft.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.040]   He killed the clones immediately,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.400]   something that was, of course, controversial at the time,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.040]   but in hindsight, was exactly the right thing to do.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.160]   He introduced almost immediately,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.280]   I remember the Bondi Blue iMac, which was an instant hit.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.080]   He really took that company and pushed it in a completely
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.920]   new direction and has been a stellar leader since 1997.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.280]   Well, and he had carte blanche, too, unlike when he was
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.800]   at Apple the first time.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.400]   They really-- there was a lot of infighting.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.160]   There was Jobs and Scully in the board and everybody else.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.720]   And Steve is the kind of guy who can make people angry at him,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.760]   because he's a very demanding person,
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   because he wasn't purely in charge at the time,
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.800]   they showed him the door.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.600]   When he came back, however, Apple was struggling terribly.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.360]   They could have easily gone out of business in a couple of years.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.640]   And even though he was brought in as a consultant,
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.000]   Steve managed to go well beyond that.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.960]   And at that point, I think Apple was just saying,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.040]   please, Steve, anything you can think of to get us back on track.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.560]   And he said, fine, I'll do that.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.440]   And he threw out a bunch of people
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.640]   that he didn't think were appropriate for the company
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.880]   more, brought a bunch of his own people in.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.080]   And he really did turn things around
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.480]   through the-- his pure will, I think, in a lot of cases,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.960]   plus being very smart about design and where's--
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.640]   So smart.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.360]   --it was going.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.200]   I think there's no question that Jobs is brilliant
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.040]   and a brilliant leader.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.480]   And a great article on ours, Technica, this week,
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.120]   about Apple products that didn't make the cut.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.920]   People focused-- you did a great piece in Macworld.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.880]   Macworld Magazine did a great piece on Steve's success,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.280]   is those are obvious.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.800]   And of course, we can't forget that he had some failures,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.200]   not just next, but the cube, the Lisa, the Apple 3.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.640]   Apple has not been the Newton, which I think really
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.200]   is John Scully's failure.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.720]   You can't describe that to Steve Jobs.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.560]   But Apple hasn't been perfect 100%.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.240]   But boy, the successes they've had have been remarkable.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.880]   But look at this.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.120]   This is the Pippin, the game machine that never was.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.720]   I don't know if that was in Steve's time.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.080]   I have a--
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.160]   I think that was pre-sto--
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.320]   I think that was Scully.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.600]   Same with the Newton.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.160]   I have two.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.840]   I love the Newton.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.000]   But yeah.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.480]   This wasn't exactly a success.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.200]   The 20th anniversary Mac, it was pricey.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.840]   That's why.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.240]   Actually, I'd love to have one right now, wouldn't you?
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.360]   Yeah, well, they had a fire sale on them at one time.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.200]   $1,500 you could have gone them for?
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.520]   They were originally, I think, $7,500.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.320]   The Mac clones.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.520]   The Mac Johnny Ives first design?
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.480]   Pardon me?
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.440]   Wasn't that Johnny Ives first design?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.840]   Really interesting design.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.800]   Yeah, I could be wrong.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   An Apple TV, is he going to look like that?
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.320]   No.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   But it's a TV player.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.800]   On its side to take up the most amount of room possible.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.280]   Now, this--
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.320]   I feel like the cyber dispenser to the left of it, though.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.000]   Yeah, that's actually a Bose speaker system that it came with.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.400]   Yeah, but with the Apple logo on it.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.840]   Yeah, this is within day when screens were so small that in order
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.240]   to fill this display, you actually
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.040]   turned the CD-ROM sideways to maximize the real estate
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.720]   that it's consumed.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.160]   I think that might be one problem with it.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.600]   Yeah, that's the Bose subwoofer.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.840]   This is one that I don't know if I would call that a failure.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.400]   I bought one.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.960]   I loved it.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.640]   I think that was a case of--
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.080]   It's the cube design.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.960]   Design plus money does not equal success.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.200]   This was a Johnny I for design, by the way.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.120]   I loved it for a couple of reasons.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.800]   It was my 24/7 uptime machine forever,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.280]   because it was a completely silent Mac.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.640]   It was a very powerful machine.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.880]   But the entire cooling system was just a convection
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.840]   from the beginning.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.120]   I love the fact that it was just such a cool process
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.360]   getting inside it to swap off memory during anything,
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.480]   because it was replacing core memory inside house
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.640]   mainframe CPU, because you have to push down on a handle
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.880]   to handle the pop-up.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.520]   You grab it, you pull it out slowly,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.160]   and now you're carrying the entire core.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.640]   The other thing is that now-- this was sacrilege,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720]   but I didn't do it myself, but I had to admit,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.600]   when I saw a friend convert his old G4 cube into it.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.160]   It also makes a really good tissue dispenser.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.840]   $1799 to--
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.960]   I bought this on the day they discontinued it.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.240]   It's when my bad streak began.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.560]   Oh, you bought-- you paid full list for that?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.200]   I paid full list at Mac Adam.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.720]   Remember Mac Adam, Tom Sanders?
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.520]   This is a great computer store on Harrison Street in San
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.020]   Francisco.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.880]   I went down there and bought it.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.600]   I was really happy, brought it home, got home,
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.000]   and saw on the internet that day discontinued.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.800]   But I loved it.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.520]   And they say one of the reasons people didn't buy this
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.240]   is because of the hairline cracks from the screws.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.000]   That didn't bother me.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.320]   I just think this was a work of art.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.360]   I really like this.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.200]   And I love the idea that it was silent.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.600]   So this is maybe a debatably Johnny I failure as the cube.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.080]   But you can count the failures or the canceled products.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:09.960]   But nevertheless, when you say Apple II, Macintosh, iPod,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.840]   iPhone, iTunes, and the way it completely
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.000]   changed the music industry, the iPad, the Apple stores even,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.880]   these are successes that completely overshadow
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.440]   any small failures under Steve Jobs' watch.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.480]   That's why some of the debate that popped up
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.760]   about Steve Jobs' legacy after the announcement,
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   there was a title which I immediately
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.360]   spot OK.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   OK, copy and sensors indicate no intelligent life in this thread
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.960]   be mount immediately.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.000]   And because people--
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.080]   I'm just amazed by people.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.040]   Oh, you know, there was a touchscreen phone on the market
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.720]   three months before there was a piece of crap phone
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.680]   that had the same kind of component,
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.280]   but not like any-- not any of what made the iPhone, the iPhone.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.080]   And every single time they look at it, well, it wasn't the--
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.000]   apparently you're not familiar with the apricot PC,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.320]   the first commercial PC, but it's a product.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   And I'm like, yes.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.840]   It's in 2005, 2006, every computer had a mouse
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   or windows interface, and they were copying the apricot PC.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.800]   So you can make this sort of claims
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.560]   if under Steve Jobs' run, if he had one of those, two of those,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   you can say, OK, he spotted a trend early
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.280]   or beat someone to market.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.640]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.160]   It's just success after success after success--
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.000]   with, of course, a couple of failures.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.520]   But you cannot really deny that even the failures
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.760]   had their influence.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.120]   I mean, I had the really cool brochure from the next PC,
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.560]   which is the life size-- if you want to go to go trick or treating
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.160]   as the next cube, it was the brochure
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.840]   was the size of the faceplate of the next cube.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.320]   And so you're flipping through the specs,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.760]   and you're seeing every single detail in 1985, 1986,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.160]   1987, of every PC that started being made in 1999,
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.400]   2000, 2001, and that sort of thing.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.760]   So what I'm saying is that you don't get that--
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.440]   one or two, that's a happy accident.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.000]   When you get that kind of string of success,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.720]   you have to admit that however he's getting these results,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.520]   he is one of the reasons why these results are being had.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.440]   And people also point out-- and I
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.720]   don't blame them-- that of late Apple
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.960]   has become more closed, that they have perhaps
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.440]   been a little overletigious, over patent law.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.080]   And nobody's perfect.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.440]   But it's kind of like we're--
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.200]   Doc Sturl's compared to the Beethoven of technology.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.680]   I'm my compare him to an athlete who just has amazing
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.840]   success after amazing success.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.720]   And you just say, can he keep it up?
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.480]   And he just kept doing it.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.200]   And I have to say, it's very impressive, very hard not
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.560]   to eulogize Steve Jobs.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.040]   But we have no idea what his health situation is.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.480]   We're not going to delve into that.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.640]   TMZ fake photos notwithstanding.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.200]   This is not the day to talk about that by any means.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.440]   I think that if you enjoy technology,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.080]   it's hard not to say, there's a guy who really changed our world.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.000]   Period, and leave it at that.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.080]   We're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.120]   We've got the great Chris Breen here, the Mac Daddy,
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.840]   from Macworld Magazine, Macworld.com.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.600]   Always great to have you on Chris.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.360]   Andy and Akko as well from the Chicago Sun
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.600]   Times in the Celestial Waste of Ban with Alex Lindsey
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.200]   is on assignment.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   Actually, he's in San Francisco with Dreamforce.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.760]   He's with the big Dreamforce conference.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.280]   He was going to be doing a pixx course.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.000]   He's going to be doing a lot of streaming from that.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.240]   So that's where he is today.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   Coming up, let's talk about that Apple TV.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.520]   Apple deals for network programming.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.520]   Apparently, something is in the works.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.040]   And the iPhone as well is in the news.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.520]   But we're going to take a break right now
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.120]   and talk about our friends at Citrix, who do the fantastic
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.400]   go-to meeting now with video.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.600]   Go to meeting with HD faces is really remarkable.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.000]   If you've been using Go to meeting,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.600]   we've recommended it certainly.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.920]   And if you probably tried it out,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.120]   that's the product that lets you meet online on a Mac
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.280]   or Windows with clients anywhere in the world.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.160]   It's very easy.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.720]   They don't have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.440]   You send them a link in the email and invitation.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.000]   They accept the software.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.400]   When they click the link, the software downloads in 30 seconds.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.600]   And boom, you're talking to them.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.120]   They have as built-in VoIP or a conference bridge
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.680]   if you prefer to use the phone.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.760]   You could see their screen.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.680]   They could see your screen.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.560]   You can show them the PowerPoint or the keynote presentation.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.080]   Completely cross-platform, completely SSL so it's secure.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.560]   But now they've had a new feature that absolutely takes it
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.160]   to the next level.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.160]   It's called HD faces.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.520]   And it's the ability to see the people you're meeting with.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.040]   And I have to say now that it's here,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.640]   I don't know how we live without it.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.680]   The ability to see what your meeting attendees are doing,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.320]   whether they're nodding or frowning,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.640]   whether they've got their arms folded
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.320]   or they have an open expression,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.960]   can tell you so much when you're meeting with a client.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.720]   And of course, a client sees you.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.920]   That's valuable too.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.520]   You can move these windows around so they're
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.760]   at the top of the screen at the side or the bottom.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.120]   You still get the screen presentation.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.240]   The video is spectacular.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.680]   All I need is an internet connection and a webcam.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.840]   Most people now, especially at work,
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.000]   have enough bandwidth to do high def.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   It just looks so good.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.720]   It's really like your meeting with these people.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.040]   Now you might have looked at video conferencing systems
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.560]   from the big guys like Cisco.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.920]   Tens of thousands of dollars later.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   And you still don't get this kind of quality,
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.440]   this kind of presence.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.360]   And now it's free for the next 30 days.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.560]   All I ask you to do is go to gotomeeting.com.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.840]   Click the try at free button.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.480]   It's that big orange button right in the front page there.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.640]   And enter in the offer code MAC break.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.160]   That's all I ask you to do.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.480]   We'll get credit for it and you will get a free trial
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.360]   of what is absolutely mind-boggling software.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.640]   The fastest, easiest way to meet online,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.920]   now with video HD faces.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.040]   By the way, it works with not only Macs and PCs,
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.440]   but iPads, iPhones, Android devices as well.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.880]   Up to 15 attendees per meeting.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.600]   And I think the limit on video six, I don't know.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.680]   That's how many we got in there.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.200]   Maybe you can have more.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.240]   Go tomeeting.com, use the offer code MAC break.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.920]   It is truly amazing.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.640]   It's all we do now when we have online meetings.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.480]   I just love it.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.240]   HP is saying maybe we won't kill the touchpad after all.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.320]   That's a shocker.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:29.080]   Somebody said that the touchpad wasn't a failed product.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.640]   It was a failed price because as soon as they moved it
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.400]   to 99 bucks, everybody wanted one.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.680]   Except I don't buy that.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.800]   I think people bought it because they thought it was
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.520]   interesting, cool.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.280]   They didn't buy it because it was a vital product.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.200]   And had it, do you think Andy, if it had gone out the door
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.160]   at 99 bucks, it could have competed with the iPad?
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   I thought that that would have been a really brave
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.040]   and smart move from HP to say that,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.600]   to see the writing on the wall, to realize that they've already
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.840]   committed to manufacturing a quarter million of these things
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.280]   and that there's no way that they're going to effectively
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.960]   compete with the iPad at that price.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.440]   But they could say, you know what?
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   We believe in WebOS, we are going to sell these at a loss
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   just so that people who want an early look at the hardware
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.840]   can get an early look at the hardware.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.440]   Now everything's pre-released right now,
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.680]   so if it starts crashing, think about that wonderful
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.960]   $99 price and that $200 that we're losing
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.440]   on every single unit.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.680]   But come and take a look at this again in 2012
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.200]   and we'll have touchpad too.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.640]   - It's not unheard of for a company to lose,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.720]   to sell at a loss like that, to gain market share
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.960]   so that you get the developer community behind you,
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.320]   you get the apps and you get the ecosystem.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.240]   In fact, if somebody's going to beat the iPad,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.600]   that seems like one of the few ways
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.960]   you could actually do it.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.000]   - Yeah, it would have been even better if they had simply
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.120]   said anybody who wants to join our developer program,
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.320]   our developer program costs $149 to join
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.280]   and you get a free touchpad with it.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.120]   - There you go.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.520]   - So you would get developers saying for 149 bucks,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.480]   I want to learn how to write apps on this.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.920]   And you get just as many people saying,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.120]   what you mean that the Kindle app is actually,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.880]   it has a solid web browser, a male client
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   and the Kindle app for $149,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.400]   I'm not going to ever write software for it,
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.200]   but gosh, I want to at least have one.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.520]   And which would have started off on a really great foot
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.680]   and a year from now, it probably would have had
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.600]   the nicest library of true tablet apps,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.680]   certainly more really true tablet apps
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.400]   than are available for Android right now.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.720]   - Did they fumble this, Chris Breen?
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.240]   - Yeah, I think they did.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.880]   I think it's very difficult to come out
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.120]   with any kind of tablet device.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.560]   It's priced close to what the iPad costs
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.440]   and certainly more than that.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.200]   Nobody's been able to do it so far.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.280]   I do think that 99 prices use a lot of people to say,
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.760]   huh, why not?
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.360]   - Well, yeah, it's 99 bucks, why not give it a try?
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.200]   - Yeah.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.480]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.640]   I mean, maybe they sold for 99 bucks in a year from now,
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.440]   they say, okay, well, now we're actually going to release
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.320]   the real one.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.160]   And I don't know if at that point everybody would use this.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   Now, this is great for 99 bucks, but if I wanted a tablet
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.000]   for 400, 500 bucks, I'm going to get an iPad
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.360]   because that's what's happening now.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.720]   And this is very interesting for 99 dollars,
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.600]   but it's not so interesting when it's $400.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.520]   - HP is clearly a company in disarray,
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.720]   the chief of the HP Personal Systems Group,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.560]   the group that would have been sold,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.800]   Todd Bradley's in China, talks to Reuters yesterday.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.560]   He says, oh, maybe we're not going to,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.400]   maybe we'll spin it off.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   Maybe we don't want to sell it.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.360]   Maybe he says, quote, tablet computing
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.880]   is a segment of the market that's relevant,
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.600]   absolutely, well, duh.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.880]   He says, a number of companies have expressed interest
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.720]   in using WebOS.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.520]   He says, Samsung could be eyeing the software.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:34.400]   He said, we're not going to sell the company.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.920]   The numbers don't support that that strategy works.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.880]   He said, points to Acer saying, look what they acquired
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.640]   Gateway in 2007, they're dying.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.560]   So they looks like they're going to spin off
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.000]   the Personal Systems Group, that includes WebOS
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.320]   as a separate company, and they're really implying,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.240]   - That's a fast.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.360]   - Yeah, you know, I mean, take this back to Apple.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.320]   - This would never, ever, ever.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.640]   - Some is managed.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.480]   - Some is managed.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.000]   If this were Apple and they had this kind of failure,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.120]   they would take the product and the entire team
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.480]   and bury them in the backyard and say,
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.680]   - Exactly what they did with Elisa, apparently.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.480]   - Exactly, just like, okay, fine.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.320]   - Sorry, dead.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.160]   - Yeah.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.840]   - And we're moving on, and HP, and I'm sorry to say that,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.400]   but since Carly came in and just ripped the guts out
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.240]   of that poor place.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.200]   - Acquired compact, then Mark heard--
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.480]   - Like they had a culture before,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.720]   and they had a real shot at being something,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.880]   and then Carly came in and destroyed the company,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.160]   and now they're running around like Apple,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.400]   just after Steve Jobs left for the first time.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.520]   It's like, well, what are we now?
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.880]   - It really has been a series of executive missteps.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.560]   Carly Fiorina acquires compact.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.760]   Mark heard acquires Palm.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.400]   Leo Apotheker comes in and says,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.560]   we're getting rid of everything.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.600]   And we're gonna be a services company.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   - Commit to something, be brave, have some guts,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.400]   and if you really believe that the WebOS is where it's going,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.600]   then stick to it.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.480]   I mean, I was shocked that they'd had it
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.000]   for just such a short period of time,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.960]   and then just said, okay, well, no, that's not gonna work.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.440]   Well, then what are you, HP?
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.640]   What are you now?
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.800]   Are you a medical equipment manufacturer?
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.360]   - You got war.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.920]   - Calculators?
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.760]   - Yeah.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.040]   - They're gonna follow the Tim Cook onion strategy.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.440]   Printers, printers, printers.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.880]   - Printers, printers.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.320]   - Divestment, the new fragrance from HP.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.520]   - Smells like...
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.200]   - Feels like overheated ozone components.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.080]   - So, okay, but there's a little line in here
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.800]   that's kind of interesting that Samsung
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.040]   might be interested in this business,
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.680]   'cause you know, remember, Samsung and Apple
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.760]   are kind of in a tussle right now.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.320]   There's rumors that Samsung might buy WebOS
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.600]   to say, maybe put that, I don't know why,
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.720]   but maybe instead of Android or maybe on their tablets,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.000]   I don't know, I think they're doing all right with Android.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.760]   Samsung has launched, I think this is very interesting.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.160]   In fact, I'm gonna immediately,
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.880]   as soon as this is available in September,
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.960]   download this, a new messenger that goes after
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.520]   Apple's eye messenger, Blackberry's messenger.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.000]   It's called Chat On, and it will run on all platforms,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.480]   including by the way, desktops,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.680]   which is something that's kind of, the only Facebook
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.520]   right now works on everything, right?
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.960]   So, I think that's an interesting.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.400]   Samsung might be the dark horse here, you think?
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.560]   - Maybe, because I do think that in the tablet space,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.880]   Android has really had a nice race car
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.360]   that just stalled at the starting line,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.200]   and meanwhile, all these slower cars
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.800]   are able to catch up and surpass them, my God,
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.640]   I didn't think we'd be able to beat Android,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.000]   but now maybe we can actually beat 'em.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Just make sure it's clear.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.760]   I think they have a great phone OS.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.200]   It's competitive with iPhone,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.320]   and if I didn't love the iPhone apps,
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.840]   and basically the iPhone way of life so much,
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.880]   I'd be really, really tempted by 4G speeds
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.920]   and some of these other cool things.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.320]   So, I'm not talking about the phone OS,
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   but they've totally, totally shanked Android for tablets.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.840]   So, I think this is making some people step back
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.200]   and saying maybe having a completely open system,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.040]   or, excuse me, idealizing a completely open system
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.280]   is not the way to go.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.600]   Maybe the way to go is to maintain control,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.920]   not in a way of refusing to allow people to do things,
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.720]   but at least showing people that this is the way
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.680]   a WebOS app should work.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.080]   This is the way that two different apps,
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.560]   made by two different companies, should work together,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.440]   and moreover, here's how we can keep this platform
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.320]   from absolutely immolating itself
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.840]   with bloatware and stupid third party addons,
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.280]   and Trojans, and all kinds of stuff
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.080]   that's giving Android's to BlackEye right now.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.800]   - I think that's, there's chat on, by the way,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.560]   this is the video that Samsung distributed.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.200]   I have to admit, the fact that I can run it on PCs
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.600]   is very, or Mac's is very intriguing to me,
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.840]   it's really everywhere.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.920]   - That's a nice fit for WebOS.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.520]   One of the things I really liked about WebOS
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.120]   is the idea that they thought of messaging
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.480]   as my connection to you, Leo, not to,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.920]   oh, I'm connecting to the AIM network
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.600]   and Leo is also on AIM and though it doesn't matter
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   where the message came from via Twitter, via email,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.680]   via fax, via teletype, it's all put together
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.800]   in the same place.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.680]   So there could be some room for these two companies
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.080]   that work all together.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   - Very, very intriguing.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.960]   Let's see, what else?
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.880]   OS 10, oh, I know what I wanted to talk about.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.920]   In fact, let's take a break and talk,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.440]   come back and talk about it.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.120]   The developer preview of iTunes matches out now.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.160]   And have you played with it, Chris?
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.480]   Have you had a chance to look at it, or Andy?
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.120]   I'm very intrigued by this.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.240]   Some new features.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.920]   - I could say officially that I have not been able
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.240]   to download any betas of anything.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.880]   - Oh, Andy's like that.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.360]   (laughing)
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.520]   So yes, I have seen that, I thought, gosh,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.080]   it might be interesting to be a developer
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.480]   and have access to that and try it out.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.640]   - No kidding? - But oh, well.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.880]   - Well, we'll tease it.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.360]   It has streaming, but that's coming up in just a second.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.400]   Andy Nocko, Chris Breen here with us to talk about
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   the latest from Apple and Cupertino.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.480]   But first I wanna mention freshbooks.com.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.600]   Somebody called me on the radio show yesterday,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.120]   or Sunday, I guess, and said,
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.000]   I'm looking for invoicing software.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.520]   I don't wanna hold big accounting package,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.120]   or maybe it'll tie into my accounting package.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.440]   I use Quicken, but he's quick on the Mac.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.160]   I kinda had a little sorry for him.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.240]   But he said, I want invoicing, and I said,
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.000]   oh, this is better than any application.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.320]   This is freshbooks.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.520]   This is the way to do invoicing, and you do it on the web,
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.240]   although they do have an iPhone and iPad app.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.480]   You can do time tracking from the iPhone app,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.880]   and then have it automatically go into your invoices.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.520]   You upload your logo, and it creates invoices for you
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.160]   easily, automatically, in some cases.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.760]   You don't have to, you don't have to,
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.120]   you can set it up so that every month
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.920]   it does the invoicing for you.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.120]   And here's the best thing.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   It'll send out that email, very professional looking
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.800]   with your logo and everything, and a button on it that says,
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.840]   pay now.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.760]   Believe me, your clients would like to pay you right away.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.280]   It's just a pain for them to go out
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.040]   and do the print, the check, and all of that.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.280]   They just click the button, and they can use their credit card,
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.240]   or PayPal, or authorized.net, or one of 11 other payment
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   gateways to pay you immediately.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.320]   If they don't, you've got automatic ticklers.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.920]   They'll keep track of where that cash flow is,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.640]   where your receivables are, and even send reminders
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.240]   to your pleasant reminders to your clients
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.480]   that they haven't paid you yet.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.960]   Time and expenses, go, as I said,
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.800]   go right in there from your iPhone app.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   And if you have clients around the world, this is fantastic.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.720]   I used FreshBooks because I was working in Canada,
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.680]   and I was billing people in Canadian dollars and US dollars.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.960]   This handles it all transparently for you,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.920]   which is fantastic.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.880]   They're a Canadian company.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.440]   Of course, they're going to be international.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.720]   You can even, and for those clients, we're kind of old-fashioned,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.600]   have FreshBooks print, stamp, and mail your invoices on paper.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.480]   Paper?
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.640]   So you've got it all for additional fee.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640]   You've got it all in there.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.920]   I'll tell you, this is a great package.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.880]   Try it right now at freshbooks.com.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.560]   Freshbooks.com.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.880]   If you look at the pricing, I think
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.880]   you'll be very pleased to find out
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:19.560]   that your first three clients are absolutely free.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.760]   That is a great deal.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.240]   Just go to freshbooks.com.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.120]   Give them your company name and email.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.800]   You'll have a log-on page that's secure available to you only.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.840]   And you can then start sending invoices automatically.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.680]   It is just fantastic.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.440]   Get started free for up to three clients.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.480]   Once you try it, you can upgrade to 25 or more clients.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.760]   25 clients to $20 a month is very affordable.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.720]   Takes about a minute to set up this account.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.840]   And don't forget, we still got the birthday cakes.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.200]   Every week, FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.320]   to Mac break listeners.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.360]   Doesn't have to be your birthday to win the cake.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.080]   Just let them know you heard about it on.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.920]   Wow, Mac.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.080]   Mac break weekly.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.000]   No, I like the guitar.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.680]   I didn't like it.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.760]   It was hitting me in the head.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.120]   Was that supposed to be a cake?
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   I was saving that for Andy and that was sweet.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.640]   Eileen Rivera running the board.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.800]   She's doing a great-- this is a new thing we do,
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.320]   where we have the producer of the show.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.360]   I mean, she's like the person who produces this show.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.080]   Actually, doing the technical directing,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.040]   switching cameras and everything.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.280]   Doing a great job.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.320]   She's like Holly Hunter in broadcast news,
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.560]   only cuter perkier and even more capable.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.080]   But she is in my ears.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.320]   She is in my ears.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.240]   And yours too apparently.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.320]   FreshBooks.com, try it today.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:41.600]   So iTunes match is, I think, the killer app for iCloud,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.560]   if you ask me.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.360]   The deal is, for $30, is it $30 or $25?
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.400]   $25 a year.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.200]   It will go through all of your tunes,
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.760]   even the ones you stole.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.160]   Even the ones from Napster, circa 1999.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.200]   Even the-- I mean, everything, right?
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.280]   It doesn't care where you got it, right?
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.440]   If it sees an MP3 on there and it has that file
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.560]   in the iTunes library in high quality AAC,
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.280]   it'll substitute it.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.840]   It's like being a Kennedy nephew.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.760]   You're untouchable.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.040]   You can fire away out of anything.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.480]   I think this is so brilliant.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.160]   Obviously, this is a-- boy, this is Steve, right?
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.440]   This is Steve Jobs marching into the music industry,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.560]   saying, look, the music has already been stolen.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.080]   We're going to give you a chance to at least
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.600]   make some of that money back.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.120]   For $25 a year-- and I bet you Apple gives a big chunk of that
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.800]   to the RIAA, right?
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.960]   For $25 a year, we will-- and for us,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.760]   it's get out of jail free.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.040]   It's amnesty, because now I'm replacing all that pirated
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   music with legitimate high quality copies of that music.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.960]   And here's the best part.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.160]   It sits in the cloud.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.440]   I can download it, right?
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.040]   But now we know, thanks to this developer beta,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.240]   I can also stream it to my iPhone.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.640]   I presume to buy anything with iTunes on it as well.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.520]   That's awesome.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.840]   Yeah, I have to wonder about the--
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.320]   Your musician Chris, does this bug you?
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.600]   No, no, I love it.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.120]   I mean, I'm-- look at all those albums this guy's purchased.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.040]   I love subscription music services.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.480]   Me too.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.280]   This is great.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.920]   And because it's only the music you don't know.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.640]   So I give subscription the benefit, because it's music--
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.480]   you know, it's all music.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.600]   But I do wonder, because Google talks about doing
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.160]   the same kind of thing, although they're in the fine print.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.280]   It does say, however, if we think some of your music is
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.480]   suspect, we're not going to offer that to you.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.520]   So I'm wondering if there's something in there as well
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.560]   where Apple will say, I don't remember this grateful dead
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.640]   concert being released commercially.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.200]   Well, they would have to have a commercial copy of that
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.040]   concert, right?
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.240]   Right.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.560]   So the way it works is, if they have it in the iTunes library,
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.640]   they will stream it to you.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.160]   If they don't have it, you upload it.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.080]   And you're allowed to upload up to 25,000 tracks.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.400]   So there could be a lot of bootleg stuff in there.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.640]   They may not allow the bootleg stuff.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.360]   But I think of all the tunes that I've got from Napster,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.840]   the good old days, the original Napster, not the new one,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.720]   that I would basically-- it will replace that 96 kilobit
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.520]   version of 16 tons by Tennessee Earney Ford,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.880]   with a high quality AAC, right?
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.960]   And I could download it.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.360]   And to listen to it on a stream, I don't have to upload it.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.400]   Which you do right now with Google Music, you have to
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.560]   upload everything, which I've done, by the way.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.640]   I've uploaded hundreds of gigabytes, I think, to Google
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.480]   Music.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.800]   So that's nice.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.880]   That means you can stream this music, which probably most
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.160]   people will want to do.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.200]   But I agree with you.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.720]   I'm a Spotify fanatic.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.080]   Spotify, MOG, RDO.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.840]   I think these subscription services, for me, like--
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.920]   so I see a Dell on-- I love a Dell, and I've listened to 21.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.520]   And the reason I had is not because I bought it, because
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.440]   I listened to it on Spotify.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.480]   Mumford and Sons, stuff like that that I didn't know about.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.280]   I've discovered on these subscription services, I follow
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.400]   you, Chris, and a lot of people.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.760]   And it's just great.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.760]   And it's also-- it's absolutely the nice, biggest piece of
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   birthday cake for music industry, trying to get people
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.000]   to discover new music.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.200]   Every now and then, maybe once or twice a year, I'll
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.920]   realize I've been listening to the same music over and over
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.120]   again.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.920]   So I'll just tweet, recommend me one track.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.720]   One track only.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.080]   You did that.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.120]   The Handful of Tracks.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.640]   Not an artist, not an album.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.920]   One track only.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.240]   And I'll take a look at it.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.640]   And I did that on Google+, and wound up with a wonderful
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.520]   thread of 300 to 400 tracks from all kinds of people.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.040]   And then somebody who was paying attention to the thread
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.480]   said, you know what?
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.560]   I'm on Spotify.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.720]   I'll create a Spotify playlist with all of this stuff.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.760]   And now there's a playlist of 280 just here are random
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.240]   people who happen to see that message on Google+.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:40.960]   Here are the tracks.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.880]   If they don't recommend only one track from their library,
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.120]   here's what they went with.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.080]   And I was there for like two or three hours.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.760]   They're like, oh, that's good.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.920]   I want to buy-- oh, that's good.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.000]   I want to buy-- oh, that's good.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.760]   I want to buy that.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.200]   Right.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.920]   And it cost me about 50 or 60 bucks.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.440]   And that's money that would not have gone into the
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.880]   recording industry's pocket if it had not been for Spotify.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.200]   So these are good things.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.800]   Well, and you didn't have to buy it if it's on Spotify as
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.120]   long as you don't need to have a copy of it on your hard
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.600]   drive, you can stream it.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.520]   Well, I mean, it's interesting that you decide to buy.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.960]   Because I like to have--
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.680]   I agree with Mr. Jobs there.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.760]   I like to have an unlocked file on my hard drive that I can
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.480]   then move on to anything I want.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.640]   I also realize that you can't get access to the mobile
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.320]   features of Spotify unless you're paying one of the
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.560]   premium raise for it.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.040]   So just as with iTunes Music Match, it's possible if you
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.440]   don't keep coming across with this money, that music goes
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.480]   away.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.920]   And for most of the music I listen to, you've kind of
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.600]   fade in, fade out.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.200]   But there are kinds that are just get moved into that most
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.880]   awesome, most critical playlist.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.080]   And you want to make sure that not only do you want to make
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.160]   sure you have access to that, in some way you want to make
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.920]   sure that somebody gets some money for this because you
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.120]   really love it that much.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.720]   By the way, you've been using Google+ really well.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   And I think this is one of the most fun things that you did.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:02.120]   You got 382 people recommending cuts.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.000]   So you're going to do this again because I think it's a
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   great idea.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.440]   Basically, you say pick one song.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.200]   I don't want to review.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:09.840]   I don't want comments.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.480]   I just want one song.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.560]   It started off when a number of years ago, I think Chris
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.400]   will even remember this.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.680]   Tonya Anxt was having a birthday party for Adam Anxt and
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.800]   just emailed all of his friends like privately saying, I want
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.560]   to basically give him a CD, burn with one recommended
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.280]   song from each one of his friends.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.360]   And I love that.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.720]   And the thing is, I don't want to be overwhelmed.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.000]   Just give me one track.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.320]   And I just thought it was really fun thinking, if I can just
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.240]   recommend one track, and then which one would it be?
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.840]   And it doesn't necessarily have to be the best one.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.200]   Doesn't necessarily have to be the most obscure one.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.080]   If there's one track that I think I want this person to
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.840]   listen to this, I think they'll enjoy it.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.080]   Which one would it be?
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.200]   It's also fun because of the plus one.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.680]   You've got actually people voting.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.800]   So you could see which one, like plus eight for sowing the
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.240]   seeds of love from tears of fears.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.520]   Tears for fears.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.520]   I was really pleased to find that a lot of these tracks I
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   already had, and not even, you know, cheers for fears or
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.240]   five for fighting or anything like anything that popular.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.360]   I'm saying, wow, other people or other people, no cab
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:14.880]   callaway?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.440]   Great.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.200]   All right.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.480]   And then now I like this because now all of these songs on
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.320]   Spotify, I could play this playlist.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:24.640]   What is it?
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.400]   159 tracks, 12 hours.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.360]   Just go right through it.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.240]   And I think every one of these songs is going to be a great
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.360]   song, many of which I've never heard of before.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.440]   So this is a very good example of why Spotify and why
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.720]   subscription services can beat something like iTunes Match.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.640]   But I have a feeling there are a lot of us who have, you
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.800]   know, thousands of tracks in our hard drive that we would
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.360]   love to legitimize.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.080]   And they are two completely different things.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Remember that iTunes Match is only for music you have
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.240]   already acquired in some fashion.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.880]   We're asked this one could say, oh, Leo just recommended this
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.480]   person called Adele.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.520]   Was it Adele?
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.520]   She's not that one.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.800]   I recommended Little Lion Man from Mumford and Sons.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.520]   That was the song I put on the list.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.000]   That was one of the ones I bought.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.320]   That's a good song, isn't it?
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.520]   That's a happy tune.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.040]   I've become a Mumford fan.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   OK, sorry.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   Sorry.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.320]   Yes.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.360]   And then there's CY music is huge.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.400]   And then there's things that album with Dylan was--
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.160]   And then there's PING that would hold it up from time.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.480]   Which could be this.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.200]   It is not getting away.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.360]   But there isn't because you don't have the ability to stream
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.280]   a playlist to somebody.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.480]   You can't just say, here's my playlist, and here's everything
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.720]   on it, and you can go through it.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.880]   Instead, Apple is--
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.920]   they're stuck with this purchase model.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   And so PING doesn't quite work.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.680]   And it could.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.240]   I mean, that's exactly where PING should be going.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.960]   But it requires that Apple has to provide some kind of
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.920]   subscription service, and they don't seem to be interested
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.880]   in doing that.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.080]   If they were ever a book written about the entire process
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.160]   of developing and shaping and deciding what PING should be
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.600]   inside of Apple, like if there was a version of that,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.280]   like Soul of a New Machine, which is all about,
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.080]   we're just going to--
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.200]   we're not an Apple fan.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.640]   We're not talking about the industry.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.600]   We're just telling you about, here's
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.400]   how something like this gets designed and built and deployed
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.720]   by a company like Apple.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.880]   I would love to see where all the branching points went
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.160]   on that decision, where, OK, should we
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.800]   make it more of a people talking to each other
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.360]   and telling people things, or should
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.880]   be more of a this person bought something
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.080]   so their French wants to know that it was bought.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.640]   OK, well, should we make it a community hub for people
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.440]   who are fans--
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.480]   don't know each other, but they're fans of this artist,
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.680]   or should it mostly be so that your circle of friends
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.120]   can be carried into the iTunes market space?
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.960]   Because, I mean, you're right, it just doesn't work.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.040]   I mean, I've noticed last week or the week
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.480]   before that I have something like 10 more times followers
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.120]   on paying than Tony Bennett.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.800]   That's not right.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.720]   This is not a universe that I want to live in,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.760]   where I have 10 more people following me on media service,
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.440]   than Tony Effing Bennett.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.400]   And I have to say that some of the success at Apple here
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.200]   is that they took the time, Steve, took the time
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.120]   to make these deals with the recording companies,
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.040]   because remember Google just recently got a mostly favorable
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.560]   court decision.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.000]   Actually, it was Michael Robertson who works at Google.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.400]   He was the guy behind mp3.com and mp3tunes.com.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.520]   The court ruled that it was OK for services like Dropbox
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.800]   and mp3tunes.com to have one copy of a song provided
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.720]   they could make sure it was an exact match
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.200]   and serve it to many people.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   That validates the Google, upload your music model,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.040]   and saves them some storage space.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.480]   But frankly, without the licenses, you can't do it.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.160]   Apple is going to be the only man standing that can do this,
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.840]   which is say, all we have to do is run this program.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.320]   It'll say, oh, I see that song.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:58.960]   Yes, we've got it.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.920]   You don't have to upload it.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.720]   That's huge.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.120]   Yeah, it's a big deal.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.880]   That close versus open locker system.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.160]   And the fact that Apple was able to do that is brilliant.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.000]   And that's a Steve Jones there, baby.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.480]   I mean, you got it.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.080]   Well, and they've got a lot of history
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.200]   with the music companies, too, and a lot of leverage.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.840]   They can certainly go in there and say, you know,
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.440]   we're selling an awful lot of your music here, Universal.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.560]   And we have the ability to stop doing that.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.840]   And so I think that there probably
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.880]   were some very tough meetings between Apple
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.800]   and the music companies, because they don't always get along.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.240]   Oh, no.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.400]   In fact, I'm sure the music companies are terrified
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.720]   of Apple's clout.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   And we'd love for Amazon.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   They turned them upside down.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.360]   We'd love for Amazon and whoever else to come along
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.120]   and give some competition to Apple.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.520]   And until somebody tells me that it was somebody else,
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.760]   I'm going to give credit to Steve Jobs,
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.480]   because he's the guy who would go in those meetings.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.400]   And he's the guy with a Hollywood street cred.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   He's Disney.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.200]   He's Pixar.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:50.880]   He could go in.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.640]   And I think he could wield a mighty big club
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.960]   and was not unwilling to really stick it to the music
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.040]   companies from day one.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.720]   And until somebody tells me otherwise, you know, that, oh,
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.800]   no, it was really, you know, I don't know, Johnny Ive.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.520]   No, Eddie Q would be the guy who talks to me.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.480]   Eddie Q is the music guy.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.920]   But you know, it's got to be Steve, right?
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.000]   And Steve's the guy who goes into the Wall Street Journal
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.040]   or goes into Capitol Records who says, I want to,
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.680]   we're going to make it, you know, he's the big gun.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.200]   He's the big gun.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:21.840]   We're going to make it.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.040]   Well, that'll be interesting to see if Tim Cook is that guy
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.560]   who can then say, Steve's not coming in anymore.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.760]   I'm the guy who's going to walk into your office.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.080]   And whether they say, well, you don't
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.040]   seem to be in charge of Disney and you don't seem
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.200]   to be in charge of Pixar.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.440]   And why should I listen to you?
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.240]   Well, I suspect they'll give him initially because he
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:39.960]   represents Apple.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.480]   And of course, Apple's the big dog.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.760]   But it's more than just representing and having the club.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.200]   It's knowing how to wield it.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.480]   And I think there's some subtlety and some skill
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.080]   and weeding and talking and negotiating
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.000]   that obviously Steve had in spades.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.400]   Maybe Tim does.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.480]   Tim is the supply guy.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.400]   I mean, he's the guy who's been able to make these deals
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.240]   with China.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:00.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.520]   No, I suspect that he's fearless and he can get this stuff
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   done as well.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.720]   It just, he doesn't have quite as many attack points
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:11.000]   as Jobs does, where he's involved in so many industries.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.720]   And he's a known quantity to these people.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.280]   And whereas Tim, they may say, well, maybe we can slip one
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:15.920]   over on this guy.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.160]   I doubt they can.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.400]   But they certainly will have a shot at it.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.480]   All right, we're going to go to the crazy file now.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.840]   iPad Bridesmaid attends wedding via FaceTime on her,
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   you know, on an iPad.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.960]   Apparently, the wedding of Jonathan Alberico and Jamie
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.680]   Wilborn in Denver, Colorado, just not convenient for Bridesmaid
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.600]   Renee Armstrong.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.920]   She lives in Richmond, Virginia.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.800]   So she dressed up and FaceTimeed in.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.960]   She's apparently the bad economy made it impossible for her
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.720]   to come.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.360]   And they actually carried her iPad down the aisle.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.840]   There it is.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.240]   And she had a front row seat.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.080]   There you go.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.480]   Is that Dorky or what?
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.400]   He looks, he looks real happy.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.080]   At least it's a white iPad.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.240]   You know, it goes with the thing.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:04.880]   No, no, no.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   She's not supposed to be wearing white
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.000]   and taking attention away from the bride.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.320]   You're right.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.040]   Oh, man.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.160]   She may as well open up the red iPad.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.640]   Here comes the iPad.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.560]   So the funny thing is we did the similar thing
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.520]   at our grand opening party on Sunday the 21st Dicty Bartola
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.960]   Mads, Mads writer and a host of our Daily Gizwiz Show
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.880]   couldn't make it.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.360]   We set him up with a Skype presence and a camera.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.320]   And so this is going to be more and more people
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.520]   are going to virtually attend events.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.840]   We should have used an iPad than he could have, you know,
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.120]   wandered with the guests.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.880]   That is just bizarre.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.920]   But hey, at least you could be there.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.040]   Just, well, it's this true.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.760]   I mean, also you think about if I didn't really
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.160]   want to fly 3,000 miles or to go to do
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   to get on some sort of windswept-bolly temple to do this,
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.080]   I could say, OK, here's the deal.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.480]   It's going to cost me $1,200 to a 10-year wedding.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:06.040]   Or I can go to my Apple store, buy a $500 iPad, mail it to you.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:06.840]   I tend that way.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.920]   And you can do the iPad.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.320]   Above and beyond, I'm going to get you for your wedding gift.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.680]   You know, she can't catch your bouquets, the only negative
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.800]   as far as I can tell.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.440]   And the funny thing is, really, aren't we doing exactly the same
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.520]   thing here with you guys?
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.840]   You know, you're telepresencing into the show.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:26.560]   I keep sending you invoices for that video that our airlines will
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.360]   give you that month pass.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:28.880]   But apparently--
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   I am out.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.720]   Somebody blew all of his money on fancy wingback chairs.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.960]   I'm not going to point any fingers.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.640]   Hey, at least it was a bridesmaid, not the bride.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.560]   True.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.080]   But I have-- I've faced time with family at Thanksgiving
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.840]   when they can't be there or at a holiday event.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.480]   So this is a little more of a stretch.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.080]   But I think increasingly you do see this now,
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.920]   where people can't make it for one reason or another.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.400]   And they'd like to feel like they're
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.880]   part of the family, still are part of the event.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.240]   And it's nice that they make the effort.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.760]   And then we have this technology that provides that kind
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.680]   of capability.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.800]   I think it's kind of cool.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.520]   I will say that the slightly more mainstream answer
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:09.960]   would have been, we're going to set up a streaming camera
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.840]   somewhere in the ceremony so that anybody who wishes
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.800]   to could not attend for any reason.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.560]   Here is the private link, and you can watch it.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.920]   I think a lot of people do that, actually.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.760]   Otherwise, it's sort of like being the only person in the wedding
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.240]   party who is wearing a Starfleet uniform.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.360]   It's OK.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:25.960]   You're unique.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.600]   You're individual.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.200]   It's cool.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:27.720]   But--
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.220]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.680]   It's really actually more about those two people over the thing.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.200]   Right.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.120]   It does steal a little of the thunder, doesn't it?
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.000]   I'm a traditionalist when it comes to weddings.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.400]   Good man.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.600]   He never wears white.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.760]   Tampa Bear.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.440]   Well, I don't.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.280]   That's how we post as I mustn't wear white at a wedding
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   gym.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.120]   I don't want to cry.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   Only before Labor Day.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.240]   Tampa Bay Buccaneers buy every player an iPad
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   instead of those big phone book playbooks
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:56.640]   that they hand out every year to the players.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.720]   All the plays will be on here, including video, which
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.480]   is kind of cool.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.560]   And they could be automatically updated.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.840]   And one of the reasons that the owners of the Bucks
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.560]   were glad to do this is they say,
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.000]   unlike the real playbook or the traditional paper
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   playbook, if it's lost, we can wipe it, exactly.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:15.440]   Exactly.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.160]   There's some incredible infrastructure going on,
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.480]   even in college football.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.840]   When I was at the University of Colorado,
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.600]   Boulder during the athletic department,
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.720]   the guy who runs the video there was happy and was kind enough
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:34.320]   to let me use his massive, massive internet connection.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.840]   As you can guess how fast their internet is
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.200]   in the athletic department to do the show from.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.680]   And he gave me a tour of the facility
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:45.800]   and showing me exactly everything that goes into their support
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:50.440]   of the football program, where I'm allowed to talk about this.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.280]   And there's nothing secret.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.800]   This is a commercial product where all the coaches,
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.560]   everywhere they go, they have an iPad.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.000]   And if they want to see, if they have a request for, give me,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.480]   I'm going to show how little I know about football,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.560]   but give me every left, left favorite passing play
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.200]   on artificial turf that happened when the sun was low
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.520]   in the field to a guy whose stats were less than this,
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.040]   this and this and this type of game.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.840]   And eight seconds later, they can get that video
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.840]   just nicely queued up everywhere that wants to go.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.840]   And it's used for analysis, it's used for instruction.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.760]   Basically, any clip from any practice or any game
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.560]   can be called up on these iPads.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   It's completely secure and it allows a level of,
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.440]   a level of intergalactic planetary destruction
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.920]   that is probably inappropriate for what is an amateur athletic contest.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.280]   - Absolutely, whatever he said.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.360]   - I was pretty blown away. - I concur.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.240]   - Yeah, here's something from Urban Outfitters for 20 bucks
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.840]   that you might want for your next iPhone case.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.920]   It makes it look exactly like one of those big cell phones
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:00.480]   that Michael Douglas used in Wall Street, the original,
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.680]   and the iPhone just snaps right into there and nobody will know
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.760]   that you have a modern smartphone.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.240]   I love that. - Really?
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   - Six-minute illegal.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.280]   (laughing)
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.800]   Actually, I am actually waiting for a month to get the new iPhone.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   My old iPhone has been handed out to my,
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.560]   my children manage to break iPhones pretty quickly
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.200]   and they don't like cases.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.360]   It's funny, they really don't.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.080]   And the iPhone 4, it's like, you know,
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.840]   I'm carrying a piece of glass in my pocket
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.480]   and it just always breaks.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.320]   We've gone through it.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.920]   - Well, and clearly it's not bulky enough for you.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.680]   So you're kind of holding the big thing.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.240]   - You're holding the big thing.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.080]   - I can't break.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.400]   But no, I guess the new iPhones will be out.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.000]   Now, Kara Swisher was adamant.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.840]   She says, "No way in September.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.480]   "Our sources we know at all things D, October."
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.360]   Anyway, I told my daughter a month
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.800]   and you can have the new iPhone.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.280]   Do you think it's worth waiting for?
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.560]   - I still don't know.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.440]   I think it's gonna, I still,
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.120]   my money is still on an incremental
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.280]   like component upgrade to the iPhone 4.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.840]   - You don't think there'll be two this time?
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.480]   It'll just be one and then another one in June.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.160]   - I think that we're gonna see one
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.000]   that's available for sale this year.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.840]   - Okay.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.160]   - I don't know about it.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.080]   - That'll be like the 4S,
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.280]   the kind of slightly better one.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.160]   - Yeah, I just can't imagine
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.120]   a revolutionary thing that would do to the iPhone 5
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.840]   that would not require a lot of developer support.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.320]   Or the sort of, you know,
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.240]   these distant early warning signs that come
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.080]   when there's something really, really big coming.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.920]   - Right.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.520]   - And you know, it really has to happen in September
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.280]   or early October and we're not seeing any of those signs.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.120]   - Right.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.000]   - So I'm thinking about component upgrade to iPhone 4.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.560]   We'll see the iPhone 5 next year.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.960]   - Okay, makes sense.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.480]   Let us take a break and we're gonna come back
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.200]   with your iOS and Lion tip.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.600]   Chris Breen, if you wanna do a Lion tip,
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.840]   you can, otherwise I can fill in,
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.280]   but I know Andy's got a good eye.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.120]   Is that right?
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.960]   Andy, you got the iOS tip?
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.880]   - No, I have the--
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.960]   - Chris has the iOS tip.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.960]   Andy, if you wanna do a Lion tip, you can.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.320]   If not, I have a Lion tip.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.280]   And then we also will get your picks of the week,
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.120]   but before we do that.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.600]   - I've been more concerned about getting orphaned animals
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.440]   to safety through the hurricane.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.680]   So if you wanna do the Lion tip, by all means--
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.600]   - That was my tip.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.440]   - I'm sorry, I didn't want--
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.760]   - I had to get a Lion to safety through the hurricane.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.440]   No, I have a Lion tip I could give.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.560]   - Under, it was a terrified,
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.160]   under my porch, wouldn't come out.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.680]   I had a kill a groundhog,
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.680]   it just like sort of trailed the blood outside
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.920]   to get him to follow.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.800]   - Our cat, we at my son had a 17th birthday party
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.480]   at our house, it was in his words a rager.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.360]   And that was on Saturday night,
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.400]   our cat just came back, so.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.760]   (laughing)
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.600]   - That's a good party.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.440]   - Did you say?
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.800]   - Jennifer was so upset, she was like,
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.960]   Charlie, where are you Charlie?
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.560]   - The middle of the night last night, she jumps up.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.120]   The cat is back.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.560]   - The cat's like, I don't want to be
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.160]   in another damn YouTube video.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.080]   It wasn't even funny the first time.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.360]   I'll be at my trailer.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.160]   And I no longer hear teens barfing
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.200]   and the wind the crash fans, then I'll come back in.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.040]   - Oh. - I'm sorry,
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   I just made you worried tonight.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.840]   - No, I was there, I heard it all.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.880]   There you go, you were running the keg.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.520]   - I would, no.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.360]   - No, no, no.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.200]   - No, no, no.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.240]   - No, no, no, no, no, under age drinking.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.080]   I'm a little disheartened to see the number
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.040]   of teenagers who smoke cigarettes, though.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.960]   I don't get that.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.840]   Does it like they didn't get the memo?
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.920]   Just don't understand that.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.320]   - They have a larger allowance than I had at that age.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.760]   If they can afford seven bucks a pack.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.920]   - I know.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.240]   Either that or their mom or their dad should egg,
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.480]   first quit and be lock up their stash a little bit better.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.360]   - I only know because after, during cleanup,
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.760]   I found a number of,
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.440]   well, some of them are hand rolling their cigarettes,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.320]   so maybe they're doing that to save money.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.880]   Anyway, let's talk a little bit about audible.com.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.960]   It's audio books, my friends,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.320]   and I am just an audible fanatic.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.760]   I have been since I joined 11 years ago.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.640]   Now I have over 500 books in my audible library.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.480]   That's one nice feature about audible.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.520]   Because it's virtual, you know, it's digital,
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.480]   you can download any book you've ever listened to on Audible
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.440]   forever.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:13.240]   So I've got the most amazing library of books
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.400]   and of course there's always new books too.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.600]   Andy, I gotta give you credit.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.240]   I'm listening to Andy and I go,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.120]   picks every time I just finished the
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.400]   Bobby Fisher book endgame, loved that.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.440]   I am now reading the David McCullough book,
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.880]   a greater journey about the Americans in Paris
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.400]   in the 1830s and 40s.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.360]   Fantastic.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.480]   I can't wait to hear what your next recommendation is,
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.280]   but folks, I just want to encourage you to check out
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.400]   audible.com.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.560]   75,000, you're having fun with those transitions, aren't you?
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.000]   I'm chewing them up for the tips and I keep forgetting
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:46.840]   that I got it.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.680]   I like that.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.520]   No, that's a good one.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.360]   That's a good one.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.480]   You can sign up for the gold account.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.520]   That's a book a month.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.600]   The first month is free.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.800]   First book is free and you can cancel anytime and keep it.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.160]   So that's awfully nice.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.760]   Almost every book, there are a few really long books
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.080]   that are not one credit, but almost every book is one credit,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.120]   including all the books that we recommend.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.440]   This looks like an interesting book,
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.440]   1959, the year everything changed.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.160]   My problem is I'm just-- I mean, if I look at my library,
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.200]   I'm so far behind on Audible Listening.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.280]   I just got Secretary at William Naxbook
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.200]   that you recommended Andy Inako.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.160]   I wanted to read Michael.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.040]   I'm a big Michael Lewis fan, the big short end game
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.360]   I finished, Greater Journey I'm Listening to.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.240]   Solaris I'm Listening to, another Andy Inako pick.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.600]   You've got to stop doing this to me, Andy.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.000]   So you can see I love Audible and I
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.640]   think you'll love Audible if you like listening.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.040]   The thing is you can get reading done in the down times
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.120]   when you're in the commute or you're at the gym
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.080]   or you're cleaning the house or you're picking up
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.400]   roaches around the backyard.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   This is when Audible really comes in handy.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.280]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.600]   OK, Andy, fire away.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.080]   Let's get a recommend-- another book to add to my list,
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.360]   my growing list.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.200]   Well, this might be an even better pick
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.160]   because I don't normally recommend a bridge to editions
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.120]   because there's so many good titles
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.640]   and you never know what they cut out.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.520]   But Mine is by Richard Hammond, one of the three hosts
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.920]   of the UK show Top Gear.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.680]   As you do, Adventures with Evil Oliver and the Vice President
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.320]   of Botswana.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.720]   If you're a fan on Top Gear show, you'll definitely
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.000]   like this book.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.600]   If you're not aware of it, I think
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.080]   that you'll still like it.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.000]   Two of these stories are essentially
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   the commentary tracks of two of these really cool extended
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.080]   films that Top Gear did.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.920]   One adventure in which Richard Hammond was in a dog sled,
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.960]   racing the other two hosts who are in an SUV to the North Pole.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.080]   Not the Arctic Circle, but to the magnetic North Pole.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.760]   Hammond's in a dog sled.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.920]   When I was-- it was a great show, but I'm lacking cheese.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.480]   I bet there was a much better story of Richard Hammond,
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.000]   like not inside this cozy cab, actually pouring alcoholic drinks
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.920]   as their buds are bouncing over the tundra.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.440]   It's more interesting, this guy who's actually
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.480]   having to like co-manage a dog sled team and camp out
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.440]   in the snow.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.560]   And so he tells the entire story of what it
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.080]   was like from his perspective.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.760]   And he's a very, very solid storyteller.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.640]   All three of these guys have books and anthologies out
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.640]   because they're also all really good SAS and really good
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.000]   writers.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.400]   They all have columns in the newspapers over in the UK.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.760]   And they're three really good stories.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.720]   One of the best ones, though, is from when
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.360]   he did a documentary about the final days of Evil
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360]   Knievel.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:38.400]   He joined a producer who wanted to do an hour long special
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.120]   about Evil Knievel's life.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.040]   They happened to get him pretty much almost
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.800]   before he passed away.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.360]   So he went to Evil Knievel days in North Dakota,
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.200]   which is a big stunt spectacular.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.280]   Talked him about his life, got to know him
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.040]   as current infirmities and current problems.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:58.280]   And given that Evil Knievel was a childhood hero
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.760]   of Richard Hammond, there's a lot of personal stuff on his.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.280]   And what was like to-- oh, he's really kind of broken down
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:03.800]   now.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.920]   And he made a lot of bad decisions.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.280]   It was kind of a jerk to a lot of people.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.600]   But a lot of people loved him.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.520]   And he was the right person at the right time.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.720]   So I happen to have read this in Kindle edition cover
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.560]   to cover, really, really liked it.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.120]   Sampled the audio edition.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.480]   The audio edition is a bridge to three hours and two minutes.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.520]   So you can look at that as an advantage because I'm kind of
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.040]   like you.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.400]   There are so many books that I like that I will get like--
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.760]   So a 13-hour book, I'll get five hours into it.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.240]   And then I'll be in lockdown mode on work.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.080]   And I will not have a chance to go out and take my walks
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.280]   or take some drives.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.920]   And I'll fall behind for a couple of weeks.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.320]   This one, you can definitely consume in a couple of days.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.240]   It gets me to the gym.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.280]   I have to say that because I want that listening time.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.840]   So I think, well, all right, I'll do the Stairmaster
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.080]   for an hour.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.160]   I just tweeted about this earlier this morning.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.920]   I've been without power for three days.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.120]   And I've got-- I can't even get into it.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.920]   Such a massive deadline on Friday, which has become--
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.480]   I'm starting to suspect that the good Lord does not
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.920]   want this thing to be finished because so many obstacles
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.000]   have been thrown up just in the last week.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.880]   So when I am home for my usual work period, which
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.840]   is the goes into like 3, 4 in the morning,
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.360]   the only power that I have to write on
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.840]   are on whatever I was able to recharge during the day.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.320]   But I got so sick and tired of not
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.720]   being able to listen to any music, not
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.640]   be able to watch anything.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.600]   I actually got out my old iPod, Nana,
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.480]   which hasn't been charged in like 2 and 1/2, three years.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.000]   I charged it up for my UPS just so
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.440]   that I can load a couple audiobooks on it
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.440]   and have something to listen to without fearing
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.520]   that I was draining down batteries on something
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.320]   that I needed to work with.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.840]   So audiobooks, they're a really good investment, I think.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.560]   By the way, just to this search for Steve Jobs,
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.080]   there are a lot of great audiobooks about Steve Jobs.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.480]   You recommended, I think, or somebody
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.720]   did that return it a little kingdom.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.680]   Maybe that was-- I think that might have been Paul Theron.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.200]   I think you're right.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.800]   The original book about Steve Jobs, and of course,
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   then there are subsequent books like Icon.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.240]   And Alan Deutschman is the second coming of Steve Jobs.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.200]   These are great books, if you want to know more about Steve
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:03.840]   Jobs.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.320]   Not necessarily approved of by Steve Jobs,
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.520]   but you definitely get a picture of the man.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.400]   Of course, I'm sure Audible will have an audio version
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.120]   of the official Steve Jobs biography, which
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.720]   comes out in a couple of months.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.920]   Try it free today, one free book, waiting for you.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.680]   Give it a shine.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.840]   No, you're going to like it.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.040]   All right, it's time to get our iOS tip of the week.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.360]   Chris Breen doing duty for Alex Lindsay today.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.320]   Hey, Chris.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.440]   Hey, OK, so I'm going to show you the magic that is DFU mode.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.120]   Oh boy.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.360]   And it doesn't stand for what you think it stands for.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:40.800]   No, no.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.640]   It's device firmware upgrade.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.600]   That's it, of course.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.800]   And so you have your iOS device, like here.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.400]   Where's the camera?
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.560]   Oh, it's here somewhere.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.560]   And what you do is you would hold down the power button
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.560]   and the home button for 10 seconds.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.400]   At which point you let go of the power button
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.560]   and hang on to the home button.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.440]   And this is while it is tethered to your Mac.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.280]   And the point of doing this is that if you find
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.840]   that your iOS device is completely locked up,
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.280]   you need to restore it.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.840]   You plug it into your computer.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.440]   And iTunes says, I don't see any iOS device here.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.920]   You throw it into DFU mode.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.960]   When you do that, a little message
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.320]   will appear in iTunes saying, I see
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.000]   that there's an iOS device here.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.760]   I don't say iPad or whatever it is.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.600]   That is in recovery mode.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.080]   You need to restore this.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.160]   You hit restore.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.520]   And sure enough, it will download the latest iOS software
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.600]   for the device.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.840]   And it will put it on your device.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.840]   So again, helpful if you are completely hosed,
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.920]   and this thing doesn't seem to be working for some reason,
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.960]   and you need to restore the software,
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.800]   and you can't do it through another means.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.520]   DFU is the core of last resort.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.960]   Also, if you're a jailbreaker, that's how they get in
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.600]   so that you can do the jailbreaking on your device.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.800]   So helpful troubleshooting tip to know again,
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.080]   it's the last thing you want to do
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.320]   because it will wipe out any information on the device.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.720]   But totally worth knowing about it.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.160]   - It's the hardcore reset.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.080]   If nothing else, it will work.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.760]   And it's easy to f it up.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.200]   So don't f you, right?
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.640]   That's how I remember it.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.880]   Actually, you know what I recommend?
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.040]   There's some great YouTube videos
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.560]   because timing is critical.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.600]   You have to release the button just at the right time.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.600]   And it's like got to be exactly 10 seconds.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.640]   If you follow the videos, most of these videos
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.040]   will actually show it happening.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.560]   You can actually do what they do, and it works.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.400]   That's how I always do it.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.840]   - Right, yeah.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.080]   - Hey, my lion tip is really more of a don't forget,
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.360]   lion can do this tip.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.040]   I am a big, I've become a big fan of full screen mode
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.320]   on lion for a lot of my apps.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.560]   Almost all the apps I use will run in full screen mode.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.760]   And then using the gesture to wipe through it,
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.640]   this is the three fingers salute
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.320]   where you slide through it.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.800]   It really has changed how I use my laptop.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.920]   I will have different programs running
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.320]   or different desktops.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.000]   I never use spaces before.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.280]   But with this, I have spaces by swiping three fingers up
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.240]   on the trackpad.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.280]   And you see I have the different desktops here.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.120]   Holding the option key allows me to close a desktop
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.400]   that I don't need.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.800]   So if I'm not using a desktop, I can close it.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.880]   But I can also jump to any desktop
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.040]   and using three fingers horizontally instead of vertically,
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.680]   I can swipe back and forth through the desktops,
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.280]   which is really nice because I keep these screens full,
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.440]   my mail, my Chrome.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.160]   I usually keep my calendar full screen
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.360]   in the chat room full screen.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.640]   And it just is a really nice way to be able
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.680]   to move through screens whenever I have a new screen to add,
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.640]   let's say for instance Spotify.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.440]   So I minimize Spotify, let's reopen it here.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.560]   I just swipe up and drag Spotify to the screen,
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.960]   just like spaces, but it just really is a handy way
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.680]   to navigate through.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.600]   My tip really isn't that, just to remind you to look at that.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.680]   And then to change the mission control settings
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.720]   in the system preferences pane,
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.320]   because you'll notice you can use different settings here,
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.360]   different ways to change how you visualize things.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.880]   I actually prefer to use the up arrow,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.200]   the control up arrow to bring up all the screens
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.320]   and then control left and right arrow to move back and forth.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.400]   If you don't have a trackpad that actually works quite well.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.280]   So play with these settings.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.640]   I turn off dashboard, who wants to see that?
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.040]   And I think that this just is actually finally implemented
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.080]   perfectly for the way I use it.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.280]   Take a look at the various controls here.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.280]   I actually love to have the control keys in use
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.480]   for doing this on the systems
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.440]   that I don't have a swipe capability.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.760]   Very handy.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.800]   Mission control and now,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.640]   (grunts)
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.680]   our lion tip, that's our lion.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.040]   He's just looking at me.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.840]   - You know, at Propo and nothing,
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.600]   like there's a lot of down power lines
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.320]   being worked on by the utility companies.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.880]   And one of the flag men like driving over here
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.280]   had the most awesome high on the basis and a heavy metal band.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.880]   I'm just doing this to make some bread
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.080]   until a lot of finish our album.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.320]   He was like, he was a little bit past that age,
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.680]   but the most huge head of,
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.080]   like not fitting, not anything.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.160]   It was like just the hugest head
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.000]   of heavy metal bass player hair I've ever seen.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.480]   - I almost wanted to just like, you know, throw the goat.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.240]   (laughs)
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.520]   And now, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.280]   it's time for our picks of the week,
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.480]   starting with the man to my left, Andy Inato.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.720]   - Well, surprising, nobody.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.760]   I have a couple of hurricane related picks.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.080]   (laughs)
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.920]   The,
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.760]   I'm actually doing a column about things that, you know,
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.160]   the thing that technically it is things
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.040]   I did to prepare for this is gonna be the sun times,
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.480]   probably this week.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.200]   But I'm gonna recommend two things,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.520]   a really cool app for the iPad called Hurricane HD,
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.080]   because when you're watching the earlier,
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.240]   last week when these coasts got a gotten earthquake,
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.040]   it means some West Coast friends were talking about
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.000]   the differences between, well, which would you rather,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.580]   which I would rather not have a disaster
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.360]   where there's no warning, it just happens.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.760]   - Yeah, this is so much better than an earthquake, you know?
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.840]   - Right, and they would-- - You could prepare for it.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.160]   - Yeah, but West Coast people were saying,
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.920]   well, what do you do for an entire week
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.280]   just anticipating that your house could be destroyed,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.760]   so we'll know you do things to prepare
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.600]   and you sort of watch where the storm is happening.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.600]   - We spend our entire lives anticipating
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.720]   that the big ones gonna come.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.600]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.400]   - I mean, we know we're gonna have one, we just don't know when.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400]   - It's like a surprise party.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.640]   - It's a surprise.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.720]   With God giving a present, you really didn't want,
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   but you have to accept it anyway.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.960]   - This looks like a great app, I have to say.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   - It is great, it is great.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.880]   It gives you really very, very fresh hurricane tracking
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.320]   information because the whole point,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.360]   if you've never like kept your eye on a hurricane
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.200]   that was headed towards your community,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.960]   it's all about where is this track.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.040]   And earlier in the week, it looked like,
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.520]   okay, we could be getting a category too
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.440]   that's headed right for my part of the state.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.360]   And yes, I'm sort of near the water in some fashion.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.680]   So this could be really, really bad.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.480]   So perhaps I should be making preparations.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.760]   One set of preparation that says,
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.400]   if you have to get out of here on 20 minutes notice,
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.240]   do that.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.720]   But then as you keep watching where this thing is going,
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.800]   I just noticed, I was noticing it was going further west,
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.960]   further west, further west.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.200]   It was diminishing, diminishing.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.200]   And so while that was sitting in the house
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.640]   on the day that the hurricane was hitting,
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.920]   it was great to have this app
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.240]   and I have 3G working perfectly fine.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.400]   To occasionally see exactly,
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   there's a lot of wind, there's a lot of rain,
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.040]   the trees are really not happy with what's going on,
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.520]   but okay, it looks like the hurricane has actually passed us.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.680]   So it's gonna probably start getting better
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.080]   rather than worse right now.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.480]   So it's okay for me to be sitting in my enclosed front porch
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.520]   with a drink and a book
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.520]   and actually listen to all the white noise
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.400]   as opposed to, no, let's get into the basement
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.000]   and start if we can get anywhere lower
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.040]   than the basement right now
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.800]   because things are getting very, very bad.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.720]   So it's really good to have that kind of information.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.920]   It is loaded with that kind of information.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.720]   And whenever there is an active hurricane
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.000]   that's sort of bearing down someplace,
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.640]   it kind of defaults to that view,
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.680]   or you can tab over to other active storm systems
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.040]   that the weather service is tracking.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.800]   Now, another thing that was also really useful
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.520]   is I didn't even know that Google had this.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.400]   Google has a service called Google Crisis Response
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.920]   where when there is a major, major disaster in process
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.280]   or about to happen, it becomes the front page
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.720]   on crisislanding.appspot.com,
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.840]   at least that's the actual event page.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.400]   And when, gosh, which I had sent you a screenshot,
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.280]   but when the hurricane was happening,
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.640]   you had this map of the East Coast
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.200]   with the predicted track,
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.960]   the actual location of the eye of the hurricane,
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.120]   and its predicted track.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.600]   And you could be clicking on these buttons
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.280]   to overlay information like live radar
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.640]   to see what you're actually looking at.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.200]   The most useful was you had one layer
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.200]   that simply had, here is the line that predicts
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.880]   where all the models think that this is where it's gonna follow.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.400]   But then there was just a useful layer that says,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.240]   here is the degree of error for this track
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.400]   so that if you're still within like that shaded box,
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.360]   you know that, well, you know what, historically,
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.160]   this prediction has been off by as much as 50 miles.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.560]   So you could still be in for really a terrible,
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.200]   terrible day.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.640]   And there's also, if you wanna know, are you in a floodplain?
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.200]   Are you under an evacuation order right now?
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.160]   Keep scrolling down, keep clicking things on and off,
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.080]   and you could really see at a very close glance,
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.560]   up with one simple refresh of a webpage,
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.520]   what the current situation is.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.080]   - This is really amazing, wow.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.240]   - It really is cool.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.360]   And it was, I should say that as of,
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.080]   the storm hit on Sunday as of Saturday,
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.880]   it looked like the worst was not going to happen.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.680]   It was certainly, obviously, it was a serious storm
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.960]   for people in my area, but it was not gonna be a serious storm,
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.200]   but it was really, really important
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.080]   so I could see where things were going
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.480]   and also be able to do that without keeping,
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.080]   without burning through like the batteries on a device,
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.240]   on a house with no power in an emergency situation.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.480]   But the last thing I should say though,
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.120]   is that remember that the hurricane
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.160]   and whether they're gonna do what they're gonna do.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.840]   So just because some webpage says that,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.200]   it's passing way to your west or out of the danger zone,
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.040]   that doesn't mean you shouldn't have that bag in your car.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.520]   - Right. (laughs)
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.400]   - Ready to go.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.840]   But both of these things were extremely,
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.600]   it wasn't a scary situation.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.880]   Again, for people in my area on that day,
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.200]   it wasn't a scary situation,
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.160]   but it's good to have information to know that you are right
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.960]   to not be terribly worried about the situation
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.800]   at that moment at that time.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.360]   - And I guess I presume this would work
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.000]   for any kind of crisis, crisislanding.appspot.com
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.920]   that is map-based.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.440]   They have things like power outage maps,
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.640]   Red Cross National Shelter System,
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.320]   Hurricane Evacuation routes.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.240]   This really is a useful thing to have.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.800]   If you've got internet, I guess,
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.720]   as you're planning for the hurricane.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.600]   - Well, I mean, the good thing was 3G was working just fine.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.440]   - Right.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.680]   - And also, we've realized that what you're seeing
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.680]   actually close to the ground,
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:16.240]   and your local news services are the most,
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.560]   are the greatest arbiter.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.280]   If my local government said, okay, Andy,
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.120]   it's time for you to leave.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.680]   I'm not gonna hold a button.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.520]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.040]   - Google says this is okay.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.280]   - It's time for you.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.280]   - No, I told my mom, I said, and she got it,
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.000]   a phone that doesn't plug into the power
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.800]   so that you can call and be called,
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.480]   and it transits to radio with a battery
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.320]   so that you can monitor evacuation routes.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.680]   - Well, that's another, again, I could go
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.080]   for an hour about this, but I'll go with one last tip,
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.200]   that if you don't have a UPS,
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.440]   this is another really great reason to have one.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.680]   You can buy it for as little as 60 bucks,
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.200]   and the other good thing is that,
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.720]   the days before a storm is gonna hit,
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.000]   there's gonna be a run on water,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.440]   there's gonna be a run on canned food,
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.560]   there's gonna be a hell of a run on any battery
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.800]   for anything that was not manufactured in the Soviet Union,
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.000]   but staples will always have a big pile
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.880]   of unentruthable power supplies,
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.880]   and what that is is it's a big 12 volt lead acid battery
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.680]   that, given 12 to 16 hours of charge,
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.720]   will deliver 110 volts to devices
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.320]   for many, many hours at a time.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.760]   Now, its intended purpose is so that if you have a power outage,
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.560]   it'll keep your computer running long enough
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.560]   that you can, for half hours, you can do,
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.120]   shut things down, close things down,
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.520]   and not lose any data, not suffer any damage,
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.800]   but it also means that when the power goes out,
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.040]   you have the ability to recharge your laptop
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.720]   and recharge your phone several times.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.240]   So that's essentially, it's a big,
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.680]   in my house, it's been this big bucket of electrons
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.440]   so that if I were trapped in the house,
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.280]   I couldn't get the car and recharge my phone that way,
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.200]   or if I really needed to get another charge into my laptop,
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.560]   I could plug it into the UPS,
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.760]   get at least a 50%, 75% charge,
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.640]   and keep working for another two or three hours.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.400]   So, 60 bucks, for all the other reasons why
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.240]   it's a really good idea to have a UPS,
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.600]   if you are in any way affected by storms,
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.400]   it's another good piece of emergency equipment
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   to have inside the house.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.240]   - Great tips, great recommendations.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240]   Thank you, Andy and Ako.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.720]   Chris Breen is, as we all know,
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.440]   a professional musician in his other life,
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.240]   and keyboardist, and loves music stuff.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.160]   - I do.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:26.120]   - And I am so interested to find out more about your pick.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.080]   - Okay, well, back in the day,
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.760]   because I'm clearly by the look of my,
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.040]   this is my-- - Are you gonna say hair?
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.960]   Are you gonna say foss techs?
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.680]   - I am, I'm gonna say foss techs, Porta Studio.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.440]   We used to have these devices about, yay big,
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.200]   and you put a cassette tape in them.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.800]   - You can record Fort Track on a cassette tape.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.960]   - I know, it was amazing.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.520]   And you could get your little band together
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.440]   or have your one man band.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.200]   (imitates band music)
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.680]   You know, and it sounded awful
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.120]   'cause the noise was terrible.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.160]   Yeah, just really bad.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.200]   Although Springsteen did an album on that,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.720]   so just to show it could be done,
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.520]   and then nobody ever did it ever again.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.160]   So now, but here we are at our digital age,
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.280]   and we can still have a device about so big
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.960]   that you can record up to eight tracks on.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.160]   And the company Zoom, which is Japanese company,
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.920]   has come out with something called the R8.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.920]   - Oh, this is so cool.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:21.760]   (laughing)
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.160]   - It's not a little.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.880]   - I don't know what it does, but I must don't.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.480]   - You must own one of these because it's 300 bucks.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.320]   - Wow.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.160]   - And so, you know, price per button--
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.360]   - Very low, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.800]   - Very low, so, and it does multiple things.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.960]   So you can record two tracks at a time
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.240]   and mix up to eight tracks.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.280]   It records to an SD card.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.240]   So you can have an SD card of a capacity up to 32 gigabytes,
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.160]   which can be up to 100 hours of music.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.160]   It will record at up to 96 kilohertz, 48K.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.120]   - On to a SD card?
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.640]   - On to an SD card.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.720]   And very small, it also works as a USB audio interface,
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.240]   so you can plug it into your Mac.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.880]   - How many mic connections does it have?
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.800]   - There are two XLR connections,
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.360]   and there are two standard guitar connections.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.080]   It has phantom power, which for those microphones
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.640]   that need extra power.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.480]   It will also operate as a sequencer,
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.480]   so you can use it as a little drum machine,
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.720]   and the buttons along the bottom of it can be used
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.000]   as your drum pad, so you can sequence a drum pattern that way.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.080]   It does many, many things.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.720]   Oh, and also if you have a digital audio workstation
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.920]   application, it works as a control surface.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.440]   - It comes with Cubase.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.440]   - It comes with Cubase LE.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.480]   So if you have no software, for some reason,
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.480]   you don't have GarageBand, you can use Cubase LE.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.880]   It's an incredible bargain.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.920]   I have yet to have one in my hands,
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.680]   but I've read a review by Craig Andrton,
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.880]   who I deeply trust on any musical matter,
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.080]   and he loves the thing.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.960]   And again, 300 bucks, they make a lot of inexpensive,
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.240]   high quality recording gear,
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.760]   and this is the next step for them,
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.480]   to give you something that you can put in your guitar case,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.680]   and record some great sounding audio.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.520]   - Wait a minute.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.120]   - It has a built in sampler?
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.200]   - It has a built in sampler,
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.840]   and that's for doing drum tracks.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.880]   - Wow.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.520]   - And it comes with 500 megabytes of drum loops.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.360]   - Yeah.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.440]   - Amazing.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.600]   So really, you don't need a drummer, good.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.440]   - No.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.040]   - You can get that guy in the con ed guy
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.360]   that drove by Andy's house, he could play the bass.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.040]   You play the guitar, you do lead vocals,
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.160]   your whole band can record right here.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.000]   - That's right.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.240]   - That's amazing.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.680]   This is really, I'm so tempted to buy it,
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.120]   I have no use for it.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.840]   - No, but 300 bucks.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.680]   - Again, those 300 bucks, why not?
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.240]   - Come on, you're gonna have three touch pads,
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.800]   or you're gonna have this.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.840]   (laughing)
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.360]   - I think this looks really, really cool.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.040]   I do want it very much.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.640]   - Zoom does some amazing stuff.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.640]   Now, I presume it works with a Mac.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.480]   - It does work with a Mac.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.920]   Your son wants this.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.240]   - Yeah, I'm thinking, 'cause you know, he uses logic.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.080]   - Yeah.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.920]   - And he has a synthesizer, he's a Roland synthesizer,
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.800]   he uses to control it, a MIDI keyboard.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.680]   But I think for this, for the vocals,
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.680]   and you know, his friends could come over.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.640]   - And also, he can trigger a lot of functions
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.760]   in logic using this.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.600]   - Ah ha.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.720]   - So he can use this to hit the record,
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.960]   but instead of using a mouse.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.280]   - I think I'll just use playing, just bang on it.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.720]   - I just found his birthday present.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.040]   Look at that, it's tiny, it's not very big.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.880]   - No.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.760]   - Look at that.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.840]   And it runs on four AA batteries, if you like it.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.680]   So he can run on AC plus it's that portable.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.600]   - We can record out in the park.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.160]   - Very nice pick.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.560]   Very nice pick.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.480]   - Isn't that the equivalent of that,
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.200]   the jerk who like gets in Starbucks
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.600]   writing in a Molesky notebook?
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.440]   - Yeah.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.520]   - I just thought I'd take my acoustic guitar
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.720]   to the park center tree.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.720]   - I gave my love a cherry that had no stone.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.720]   I gave my love.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:53.560]   - Okay, that's good.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.400]   - I'm gonna write you two of these.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.840]   - Or you go to that park in every city
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.080]   that has the conga players.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:57.920]   - Yeah.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.600]   - You just record them surreptitiously,
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   at the meantime, you're just there.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.600]   - You can play the drum pads,
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.000]   you don't even need the conga players,
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.800]   you are your own conga player.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.640]   Bring up the park.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.040]   - Bring up the park that makes a public domain.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.120]   (laughing)
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.760]   - And there it is, they show it working on a Mac,
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.600]   so that's good.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.000]   Now we know it works on a Mac.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.480]   Very nice pick of the week.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   I'm gonna show you something I've been using.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.120]   Now I know we all use,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.760]   from my pick of the week, we all use Dropbox
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.240]   and we're all very happy with Dropbox.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.040]   But I became a little less happy when Dropbox,
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.040]   when the privacy issues emerged,
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.680]   the fact that even though they said
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.840]   they couldn't read your data, it turns out,
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.320]   if law enforcement asked for it,
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.160]   they'd be happy to turn it right over.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.880]   Not that I have anything I don't want law enforcement
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.320]   to see in my Dropbox, but I do feel like
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.200]   that means that also Dropbox employees who are so inclined
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.400]   could browse through my collection of vintage pornography
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.640]   from the 1930s.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.440]   So I decided to use something
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.320]   a little different called Spider Oak.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.280]   Have you guys tried this?
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.640]   Spider Oak.com.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.200]   And I've been very pleased with it.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.200]   It does everything Dropbox does.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:05.200]   It has the ability to do this shared folders that I use.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.720]   Online backup, it has sync built in
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.680]   and it uses what Steve Gibson calls P,
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.000]   pre-egress encryption.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.480]   In other words, you encrypt it using a public key
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.680]   from your system before it even goes out on the internet.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.840]   So they can't read your data.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.440]   Two gigabytes are free.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.160]   A hundred gigabytes, just $10 a month.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.280]   I think that's really good.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.640]   They also, if you have a referral program
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.080]   and you can refer a friend and get more.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.920]   And they have two factor authentication now,
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.760]   which they've just added.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.840]   So it's really, this is really pretty impressive stuff.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.000]   It runs great on the Mac.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.720]   I've put it on all of my devices.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.640]   Of course, there is an iPhone and Android app as well.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.880]   It's called Spider Oak.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.360]   And let me just show you the client
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.240]   'cause the client I think is kind of swift as well here.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.160]   I can't find it now.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.400]   There it is.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.240]   Show.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.040]   It runs in the background all the time.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.280]   It's doing the backup.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.240]   I paid for a hundred gigabytes.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.520]   You can sync and you can choose which folders you're syncing.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.720]   I'm syncing my documents and pictures folders
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.400]   from all of my computers, my MacBook studio air,
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.360]   which is what I'm using right now, my home MacBook,
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.920]   my iMac and my office and my Mac Pro at home.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.680]   All of the data is automatically synced
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.520]   so that each of them has the same thing.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.800]   This is really sweet.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.000]   I think comparable to Dropbox in a lot of ways.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.240]   The negative, of course, is that everybody uses
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.320]   the Dropbox API.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.640]   So all those programs like Elements on your iPad
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.160]   and everything, all use Dropbox.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.840]   So I still need my Dropbox unfortunately.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.640]   But for backup and for storing large amounts of data,
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.480]   this is what I'm gonna use.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.800]   It's called spider Oak at spider Oak.com.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.040]   Native app available on all platforms.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.080]   So have you used it?
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.880]   Somebody said, yeah, was that you and your?
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.960]   Yeah, I've used it.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.320]   And I like the idea of the idea that only myself
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.240]   and God can get access to this stuff,
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.520]   assuming that they were about as truthful
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.960]   with their claims as a.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.400]   Well, we know, we know.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.240]   Right.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:05.240]   We do know that the, I believe it's true
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.480]   because you generate the key here as you're doing it.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.480]   So.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.280]   But you are right.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.520]   If it's a really wonderful substitute,
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.360]   so long as you don't rely on like iOS apps
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   that integrate this sort of cloud service to great effect,
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.640]   I use elements as my mobile word processor pretty much
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.040]   for that reason that I can,
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.680]   I love that trick where I can be working on my iPad on something.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.640]   I can be doing some fact checking.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.000]   I'll have the Safari window open on the iPad.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.160]   Meanwhile here on the iPhone,
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.920]   I've got the tech that I'm actually editing.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.160]   So it's the exact same cloud that I was working on.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.760]   The exact thing if I was working on that screen,
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.760]   but I'm just simply making those real changes
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.200]   for two, it didn't have to save,
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.160]   didn't have to sync.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.200]   So that's a nice feature that's unique to Dropbox.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:00.200]   But I still think that there is stuff that's on the internet,
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.760]   that's not on the internet.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.480]   And if you've partnered something on the internet,
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.000]   there are no degrees, you have to believe
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.680]   that whatever it is you've put up there
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.520]   is going to be, is going to fall into the wrong hands.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.720]   So it just means that instead of being worried about
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.600]   Dropbox handing over a file to law enforcement,
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.120]   I'm not worried about that with Spyder Oak,
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.480]   but I am worried about, well,
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.240]   what if somebody guesses that my password
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.480]   is aligned from HelloDolly?
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.160]   - Right, right.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.440]   - Oh my God.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.120]   - You've given it away.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.120]   Price is good though, I think it's a little less expensive
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.760]   than Dropbox, a hundred bucks for a hundred gigs.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.720]   I bought a hundred gigs and I don't think
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.920]   I'm going to ever use that much.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.400]   And now all of my documents, my documents folders
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.800]   on all my Macs and my pictures folders on my Macs
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.040]   are synced and backed up to the cloud.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.240]   So it's really kind of a nice piece of mind.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.120]   And because I use so many, this is something
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.440]   that you and I probably, and Chris would use more
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.200]   than maybe a normal person because we have so many devices,
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.840]   computers at home, I have several at home,
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.920]   several at work and all that.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.320]   And so it's really nice to have the same set of documents
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.800]   on everything, I really like that.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.960]   - I can't wait, I'm sure guys in the same way.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.000]   I can't wait for a couple months.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.960]   Actually, let's call it January,
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.360]   when iCloud is fully up and spinning,
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.680]   when all the important apps have been updated
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.840]   to work with iCloud and we can finally figure out,
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.680]   is Dropbox really the best way to do something?
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.480]   The fact that iCloud has got,
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.120]   Apple's come up with a system that is hugely complex,
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.680]   requires a lot of interaction between developers,
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.840]   a service and the company that runs everything,
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.760]   and device manufacturers, is that actually delivering stuff
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.120]   that's any better than simply saying,
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.080]   well what if we just have one folder,
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.280]   with common files and open API so that anybody
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.880]   can write hooks into it, to do whatever they want?
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.640]   I still don't, I love what I've seen in iCloud so far,
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.040]   but until we get our first wide-scale live fire exercise
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:46.520]   with it, Dropbox and Spider Oke are just as credible
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.560]   for now at least.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.800]   - I agree, I agree.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.640]   - Very interesting.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.760]   - And there are others, I tried Walla,
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.440]   wasn't as crazy about it because it,
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.040]   same idea, pre-egress encryption,
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.800]   but it was Java based and kind of ugly,
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.280]   and I couldn't quite figure it out.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.880]   Spider Oke is the first that I've just really been easy
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.240]   to figure out, does well.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.720]   - On IG, Chris Breen, everybody should go to Macworld.com
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:10.640]   and read his Mac 911 column in Macworld magazine.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.480]   - Yes please. - He's just the greatest.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:14.520]   - And go see him at the Red Roof Inn,
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.040]   performing Nightly Idol.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:16.880]   - Right below.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:17.720]   (laughing)
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.560]   - Look at him.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.840]   But he, buddy love always performed at the Red Roof Inn
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.000]   in San Francisco. - That's right.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.480]   - Where, where, do you perform?
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:29.360]   I mean, do you have like gigs that we can find out about?
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.040]   - Every so often, I have a band's name, System 9,
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.920]   and it has nothing to do with Apple at all.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.920]   But yeah, every so often, we're playing a club
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.520]   or we do a lot of private events, so keep your eyes peeled.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.880]   Is there a Chris Breen website?
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.040]   We would find out about that one.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.880]   - You know, if you go to my, wow,
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.720]   where do you go? - You need to,
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.240]   you need to make a-- - I know.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.920]   - Go to Squarespace and create something, would you?
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.000]   - Let me write that down.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.720]   (laughing)
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.880]   - There, anyway. - Done.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.760]   We love having you on.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.360]   And next time, come up and visit.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.240]   We'd love to show you the new studio and everything.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.560]   - I'd love to see it. - Good.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.720]   All right, Chris, great to see you.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.320]   Thanks for joining us. - You bet.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.520]   - Andy and I co, of course, we hope you get home
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.040]   and get some power, and maybe it's not too late
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.320]   to save those frozen pizzas.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.000]   - Well, I gotta fight some rats and reccoons from right now,
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.680]   'cause they have been dumped.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   - Oh, that's-- - And see, this is the,
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.880]   in terms of like emergency preparations,
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:26.400]   the things that you really wanna take care of are things
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.240]   where it's okay if you didn't get that idea until later.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.760]   If you got that idea and you had a chance to do something
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.440]   about it and you didn't do it 'cause it was Saturday,
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.280]   I already knew that things were like, you know,
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.680]   that big huge evacuation disaster
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.960]   is probably not gonna happen.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.920]   So I was relaxing a little bit and I thought,
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.680]   you know what, I should probably just cook up
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.520]   those frozen pizzas because they're like regular peat
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.640]   takeout pizzas, they'll keep on the counter,
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.760]   they'll keep for two or three days.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.960]   And if the power goes out, I'll be really, really sorry
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.640]   that I wasn't able to enjoy those pizzas
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.840]   and I have to throw them out.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.120]   - Oh, no, you had that idea, you didn't do it
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.720]   and now you throw out these lovely, lovely--
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.240]   - If you had one of those sun ovens,
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:08.400]   you could have had like baked pizzas for the whole neighborhood.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.960]   - Oh, gosh, I also learned that sterno can actually be used
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:14.160]   to cook with, I thought it was just for like chafing.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.600]   (laughing)
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.040]   - You couldn't cook with sterno.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.000]   - It's lovely, cold, you know, right now I want you
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.440]   to go about and next time you see a cold thing
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.160]   or a hot thing that's a consumable,
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.840]   I want you to say cold thing or hot thing,
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.600]   I appreciate you because maybe someday I won't be able
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.000]   to have ready access to cold things or hot things.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.480]   - Thank God for ice.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.560]   - God.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.680]   - Andy, I hope you get back home soon.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.640]   I'm sure the power will be back today.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.480]   - I'm hoping.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.320]   - Yeah.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:40.840]   Andy Enaco is at the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.760]   he's writing a big piece right now.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.240]   So look for that tomorrow on Deadline.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.080]   Thank you for taking some time out.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.000]   - Johnny Deadline.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.200]   - Johnny Deadline there.
