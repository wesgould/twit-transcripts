[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.020]   From Apple and there is news from Apple so it's good Lori Gill is here
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.200]   She is the managing editor at imore dot com hello miss Gil
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.120]   Hi, hi, hi
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   Thank you also to Andy and not co from WGBH in Boston our East Coast reporter
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   Welcome back. He has more stripes like to be here, but you can't see them all. I
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   Promise you I bought more than one strike
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.780]   So people saying that hey he could only afford the one stripe. That's just a lot
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.300]   They're so broad and from Montreal new covet hotspot. We welcome
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.800]   YouTube fame YouTube comm slash Renee
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.940]   Richie, okay show hands. I know Andy and not co I've seen Andy a co I've met an ad-gaco and it stripes all the way down all the way down
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.740]   Show of hands did anyone get an invitation this morning
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.120]   virtual but yes, hey guess who guess who has two thumbs and got an invitation
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.620]   So the last time I thought I was a bug they sent out that weird invitation saying you want your briefing
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.480]   Here's your briefing and then they retracted it, but yes, I got another invitation here. It is
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.320]   We kind of thought this would happen if Apple was gonna have an event on
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.460]   October 13th they would announce it today October 6th the week early. This is the invite
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.460]   It says hi
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.180]   And it's not hig h h h hi comma speed. Hello. It's like saying hello speed
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.200]   Please join us for a special Apple event in Apple Park
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.620]   The Apple logo is surrounded by concentric rings
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:13.340]   Some have interpreted that as the 5g radios, but I love in our chat room said, you know, maybe that's Apple tags
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.620]   Your name is be where you very confused about the personalization of this
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.140]   Wow, they sent me a personal invite
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.700]   Yeah, that would wonder what yours had Leo hi Leo
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.860]   No mind just at high speed as well. So yeah, I mean, it's not it's not like inviting you to Apple campus to go
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.580]   But I'm hoping that they get in the habit of this and then
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.340]   For this one. Yeah, that's right. I might be at the 18,000th person on the list, but I am
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820]   But you're on the list
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.860]   So
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.180]   What we're gonna do next week is a programming note is we'll as we did last time
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.060]   With the iPad announcement and the Apple Watch announcement will start iOS today an hour or two early probably around 8 o'clock
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.740]   Pacific time 11 Eastern and then that way mica and I can do the announcement which is at 10 o'clock Pacific time
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.180]   1 p.m. Eastern 1700 UTC and then we'll start Mac break weekly immediately after the Apple announcement
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.860]   They're pretty disciplined at this point. I imagine they'll do you know it was funny the Google did its thing last week
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.740]   And it was like 29 minutes and 59 seconds
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.560]   It was like half hour bum. It's over they edit it to time
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.060]   Yeah, Apple didn't do that. Did they it was a little longer than an hour? I think yeah
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.700]   And you're forgetting that included a blooper reel like just like you know
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.240]   Can't have all run where they had like you know Bert Reynolds and Bert Reynolds breaking up and playing jokes on
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.340]   Yeah, so yeah
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.620]   Well, I also think Apple Google was just anxious to get it over with it. Yeah
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.420]   Let's go back to bed it was their night in announcement there are not
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.540]   Like we have like we have any chance of getting any attention during a new cycle during this month of this year in this world
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.820]   So why bother they couldn't be bothered to have Google IO they barely could be bothered to do a pixel event
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.220]   Which means they're clear in the way for Samsung and Apple to dominate which they would do anyway
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.420]   So this is an iPhone 12 announcement, right?
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.500]   Probably anyone check mark Irma's Twitter come up. They didn't want check mark
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.660]   Prosser said last night. This would be we'd all be getting this but I could have tweeted that
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.380]   You actually did Renee a really good
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.980]   Peace on stuff. Why are we listening to these people with zero track record in their iPhone rumors?
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.940]   Yeah, they're being blocked over and over again and it's I get it
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.780]   I get like the thirst for page views during the time of COVID must I can't even I'm not gonna look at Laurie
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.660]   I can't even imagine who pressure being put on you know professional bloggers these days
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.900]   But I think it's I think not I'm not on I'm more I'm more is rigorous about this stuff
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.580]   But on some other sites. Yeah, I think anytime they see a tweet it just gets a blog post for a long time
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.860]   I actually resisted doing rumors of any kind but I realized that that was a road to hell paved with good intense
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.860]   So we we started doing rumors judiciously
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:26.540]   But I like about the rumor stuff though is that it makes it fun to talk about what you're excited for you know
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.220]   So there's somebody might have a rumor of like the new iPhone color and then you get to say like
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.100]   Oh, wouldn't that be so great if that's real
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.020]   I would love that new color and then it gets you all excited about it
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.140]   So it's not about like for me when I talk about rumors. It's not about
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:47.500]   Believing what people say as much as it is about just sort of enjoying the idea of what's to come, you know
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.940]   So Renee you've done you did this yesterday in a piece for I'm more kind of a thought experiment about what you would like to see
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.020]   Next Tuesday for the iPhone 12 announcement
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.100]   The rumors are there's gonna be a huge variety both in colors and sizes and
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:11.540]   Yeah, my general take on that is that's to cover up the fact that there's not we really don't have a lot more
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.540]   We can add to these phones
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:20.260]   What do you think also practical because like the 5g modem if you look at what other vendors have gone through over the last year
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:27.220]   The phone size has increased because especially the millimeter wave the frequency range to modems are just big and power hungry
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.500]   So they require a lot of resources and the phones get bigger and they're really good about saying our biggest screen ever
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.660]   But what they really mean is geez call company take you can you get this working better, please?
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.280]   And so Apple has to has to fit that modem into an iPhone
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.420]   What was an iPhone 11 pro and pro max and it's gonna make it bigger it looks like they're eating the cost at least
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.820]   You know for the most part, so they're not gonna be a hundred bucks more expensive like a lot of other phones got this year
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.800]   But just supplying power to that and if they are using the next generation of
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.660]   Panels those are more expensive more power hungry
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:04.340]   So I think they're they realize they had to increase sizes on one side and they're like, okay
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.860]   We want to keep the average selling price about the same so we're gonna make a smaller version
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.980]   That's a little bit less expensive and hopefully that balances everything else and we don't just get crushed by 2020
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.460]   So the so-called 12 mini
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.460]   Probably would not have millimeter wave
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:29.820]   I think some people have said it would but I find it hard to believe it's it's such a niche technology such an under-deployed technology and such an expensive
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:39.380]   Technology that I think it's just reasonable to do what Samsung did and that's put it in sort of the higher end models and leave frequency range one the low and mid-band
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.460]   5g
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:47.060]   Radios in the lower price models. Yeah, also in the United States is kind of there's kind of a curve ball because
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.180]   Verizon seems to be betting a lot harder on millimeter wave than anybody else
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.060]   They're trying they're trying to make it into a thing for like indoor deployment and for like commercial broadband
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:04.980]   So they are trying so there I don't I'm wondering what kind of pressure the Verizon is putting on all manufacturers
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.780]   Just saying yes, I know that I know that the millimeter wave
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.620]   Forces you to think about putting a telescoping antenna into your phones for the first time in 40 years
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:20.100]   But the thing is we want this is the phone that we want to try to sell so we want you to try to make one
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:27.540]   It's ironic because as far as I can tell very few people will be able to get minute millimeter wave
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:35.020]   And keep it that's the hard part like if you turn around if you go inside if the rain if it starts raining if the leaves move on a chair
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.900]   You lose signal. It's yeah bizarre
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.900]   also
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:48.420]   As you mentioned expense and battery life, it's interesting because Google did put millimeter wave in their pixel 5 and
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.700]   analysts have said
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.740]   That's the difference primarily between the iPhone
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:11:01.100]   I'm sorry the pixel 4a 5g and the pixel 5 is this millimeter wave a hundred dollars it adds to the cost
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.580]   So that's a significant
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.420]   penalty for for a capability
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.140]   Virtually, no one will be able to use
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:18.540]   Yeah, and again we get back to Verizon because they're they bought up an enormous amount of millimeter waves spectrum
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.020]   And they really they're trying to promote this as this is why our networks are better
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.100]   And this is why we have the fastest most modern network whereas every other whereas
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.300]   In terms of subscribers of phones every other carrier is
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.620]   Promoting 5g as something is going to be very good very helpful very important, but not necessarily
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.620]   Something willing they're they're willing to sandbag a hardware design over so it's it's very you're right
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.060]   Verizon has all the pixel stock too right in the u.s. At least so far
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.860]   My sense is this was a deal with the devil that google had to make
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.020]   If they wanted Verizon to carry it they were gonna have to put millimeter wave in
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.820]   They were strong. I wonder if apple was to apple doesn't get strong armed. Yeah
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.820]   I
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.820]   Just because the problem with millimeter wave
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.940]   Is it's so high frequency that doesn't go through walls. Well, you really need virtually line of sight to the tower
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:18.140]   That doesn't all new towers too. Yeah, you need new towers and more of them four times more of them
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.700]   So it's only going to be in big cities
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:27.580]   in probably in high rises as you said in come in inside a business or perhaps
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.940]   Stadiums maybe like I don't even know if it's going to end up being a commercial technology
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.180]   I have this huge fear that it'll be like their y-max like sprint was all in on y-max
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.180]   And it just didn't work and it cost them a year
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.820]   And a fortune yeah to get over
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.620]   So are we over buying if we buy a phone with millimeter wave or are we spending more than we have to?
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.260]   So my thing my big thing about this is that you're getting a Qualcomm modem
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.740]   And I know for some people the Intel modems have been just fine
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.300]   But for a lot of people especially in borderline areas
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.980]   They just haven't held a signal as well or as long or as reliably
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:04.460]   And even if you never turn on millimeter wave or even you know sub six sub seven sub nine whatever it ends up being
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:10.140]   You're still getting a Qualcomm modem for LTE and for a lot of people. I think that'll be a huge sigh of relief
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.780]   Yeah, and on top of all that
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.420]   There it remains to be seen if any of these characters carriers can deliver 5g services
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:23.180]   That are in any way relevant to a phone above lte right now lt. It's
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.180]   Every single person every single entity that is
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.140]   Involved in streaming or data delivery at high speed
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.620]   They know how to deliver video and audio to a 4g phone extremely well
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.980]   And it's not as though we're going to have a phone with an 8k display
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.940]   If if there is one i bet it's going to be sam san who makes it just to say that they were able to make it
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:50.700]   But it's hard to figure out how you can deliver a 5g to a mobile handset in a way that
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:58.460]   Is there a serious value even even live streaming live video streaming and chatting that's perfectly fine over lte
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:06.220]   Overphone given how how much data you can throw away because it's not going to be relevant to the needs of that actual application
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.900]   So it's i keep people were asking me people a little bit surprised with me for buying
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.460]   Of an LTE phone this year
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.300]   And one of the reasons that i gave for people is that for me
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.980]   $50 for a phone this year is a good investment because i'm not going to be dumping a thousand dollars in a phone
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.860]   That two or three years from now might not be quite in tune with what the world is like
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.020]   But also that i don't think that 5g is going to make a big impact on people's lives for another couple of years at least
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:42.380]   So i'm just thinking you know i refer to this before but the pc magazine article from last month
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.940]   Race to 5g
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:53.100]   This is uh, they do this yearly they go to 26 cities concluded that 5g was a complete waste of time at this point
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:59.020]   And it's a marketing and finance point. It's it's not something anybody should be looking for in a device
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.820]   Um that the current
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.660]   Leader in 5g speeds is verizon but good luck getting anywhere near a verizon phone
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.060]   T-mobile which has the widest coverage of 5g their 5g isn't particularly faster
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.300]   so
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.820]   So
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:24.540]   It really seems like it's more robust though. It's well it's 600 megahertz. So it gets through walls. It's the low band
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.100]   5g
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.380]   I feel like the
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.500]   Phone manufacturers because everybody's putting out 5g phones now
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.900]   Got a
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.340]   So instead of having just 20 you know, which limits the amount of people on i think it goes up to 100 hertz
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.740]   Just on the aggregation so you can have many more
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.260]   It's the same tower technology and you can have just many more people on that tower
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.980]   So again, it's for those people in those areas who just always never gotten or been underserved by lt
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.100]   I think
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.900]   Uh, t-mobile is doing a good job with that the rest is just
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.460]   marketing
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.260]   Sashik
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.420]   To keep in mind though is that
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.580]   They're like not everybody is going to buy a new phone in a couple of years
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.380]   So there's going to be people buying now with even though 5g doesn't matter to them at the moment
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.980]   Five years from now they still want their phone to be you know as fast as possible and
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:22.460]   I agree that from you know the the phone makers perspective phone makers didn't need to make 5g phones yet
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.260]   But they did so from the consumer perspective
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.620]   I would say that it's not a bad idea to just go ahead and buy a 5g phone
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.660]   If you're the kind of person who only buys a phone every five or six years because five or six years from now
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.460]   5g is probably going to be more ubiquitous
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.660]   Maybe not five millimeter, but some version of 5g will be used more
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.420]   Commonly throughout the but the question is will you be disadvantaged because you're still using an lte phone
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.900]   Will you be in a slower network? Will you be on it?
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.460]   Will be less no no, and I don't even think you will have an older your 5g modem though
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.140]   You're yes
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.740]   So you're taking a gamble by buying this device that in three years 5g will be better
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:09.820]   That it will be widespread that you'll be able to get it and yes, you may as the excellent point Renee
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.020]   You're buying an older 5g technology when you buy it today
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.420]   So I feel like this is I mean it's not a gamble. We have a choice in every
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:24.780]   I mean but if if for some reason on Tuesday apple says these have 5g and these don't and in their 100 bucks less
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:31.020]   I would opt for the one without to be on some markets might not like there are rumors that outside the big markets
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.220]   They're going to have lte versions
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:37.020]   But they're not going to be coming as quickly and then you just have to deal with because the problem for consumers here is that
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:43.020]   Before lte it was a mess you had to figure out which network you were on before you could figure out which iphone you wanted to buy
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.340]   Because you had to have CDMA for Verizon and those were different models and first print back then
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.020]   And the other gsm models and we got rid of that largely with lte
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.420]   You could just buy a phone if you bought your Verizon, you know, a Verizon phone unlocked you could use it anywhere
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:00.780]   And now you're going to have to pay close attention to which phone goes with your carrier again, which just feels like a step back
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.780]   Yeah, the modems are
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.340]   Modems like cameras right now where we don't really have to worry about whether we're going to get a decent one that works
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.940]   So long as we're slums not buying a phone in a blister pack of the drugstore
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.540]   the
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:20.700]   The thing to underscore is that there's a there's a really hot phone that's not available in the United States yet. I think it's the
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.980]   I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna guess. I I haven't written down somewhere
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.700]   But it's it's so good that a lot of like review sites are importing them just to read review
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:35.020]   Uh, and what they have to under what they have to really remind people of is that because this was designed
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.300]   This was designed specifically to be sold in one limited market
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.100]   They don't have like the full qual qualcomm chips that and so that you'll find that oh well gee
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:48.380]   It doesn't I'm not getting high speed in my area because my my carrier doesn't doesn't have this
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.860]   Because this phone does not support a carrier that a a chip
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.420]   I'm sorry does not support a
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.460]   methodology that was that came across three or four years ago
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.420]   It only does like the cheap stuff that isn't really required where this thing was was meant for
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:10.460]   We ignore the great thing about technology when it's mature is that the sign of success is that we totally forget that it exists
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.380]   And that's what we get when we have like a really mature qualcomm chips inside a phone
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.780]   We forget that those wars have been fought
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.020]   And and now we've got the memorials up and we don't have to care about that anymore
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.140]   So long as we buy as long as we've spent any amount of money for a phone
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.500]   It's gonna work on whatever network that we have pretty much anywhere in the world speaking of qualcomm is there
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.580]   What is the speculation about?
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.020]   Will there be qualcomm or intel radios in these new iPhones or will it be all apple silicon
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.180]   All Qualcomm it will still have qualcomm apple isn't ready to to do a chipset yet
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.340]   They're working on it. They'll definitely get there
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.660]   But they're smart enough to to say that
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.900]   We are we are doing great stuff that works great on the apple campus
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.820]   It is not ready to inflict upon millions and millions of people that we're getting it
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.740]   We're taking a thousand dollars from now in your favorite dream Renee
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.380]   Yes
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.140]   You this was much more than an iPhone event. That's a bit prejudice
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.980]   Well, I you know, I think when apple and ass is a new iPhone
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.980]   I think their tendency would be to say look this is an iPhone event
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.220]   Well, if we have other things unless they have apple watch but they don't this time
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.100]   Like for the last few years has been an iPhone and apple watch because they're so closely had the i'd made it
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.460]   So yeah, well, we had the cheap ipad last year as well
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.540]   So like they have other stuff on occasion. So I was hoping you know
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.940]   We'd I need something in 2020 Leo. They've taken all the movies away from me. I have baby
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.140]   I have this that's all I have left in 2020
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.420]   So Renee's favorite dream includes I actually love it a new not only a
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.220]   high quality apple tv
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.540]   4k plus but a little dongle
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:56.700]   So compete with google's chromecast and fire tv sticks you call the apple tv express
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.500]   I love this. I hope they do that. That would be great
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.780]   They rumored it two years ago the information had a whole article and the information's got a
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.260]   Really good track record. They don't do a lot of apple rumors
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.540]   But they've got a really good track record when they do and the rumor was that apple was working on this is a way to get
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.820]   The apple tv services into more onto more screens because right now they're doing
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.420]   In tv's right so that would in
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.060]   Indicate to me that they could
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.260]   It must just be a chip at best that they give the tv
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.140]   Yeah, it can run on well the video service can run on low power on the chips that you get in these tv's
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.580]   But older tv's aren't getting them and it's only the tv app
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.020]   Like if you if you want all the other stuff like let's say you do want to play apple arcade
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.540]   There's there's no facility unless you buy an apple tv which is expensive
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.620]   And for me like they could put something like like the latest watch system in packages
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.540]   Not as expensive and super powerful and you can start doing some interesting things
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.540]   I thought it was one of the things google did really really well in that event was was
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.740]   Like as poorly as they sold me on 5g
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:01.420]   They sold me really well on the value of making any tv no matter how old your tv into a brand new google tv
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.860]   Yeah, except the google's pushing this stadia gaming
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:11.500]   Server kind of their version of arcade and it doesn't work to do that too and it doesn't work on the new chromecast
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.820]   So it's like the two divisions
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.620]   They built different
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.620]   And they went all you had a handshake and
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.700]   Just to put a finer point on it people
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.660]   Breveers have side-loaded the stadia app on it and verify that it does work perfectly. So it's
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.100]   There's probably a licensing or business reason why there's not that's not on yet
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.260]   That's even more important
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.580]   But that but that does show that as I as I said on my google podcast last week with flow
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.620]   I on that sometimes you get the feeling that google is being run about as well as an unlicensed nail salon
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.220]   That's a good argument. That's an Andy
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.420]   Uh
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.620]   Actually, there is a good argument that apple would love to put uh
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:23:00.780]   You know more triple a titles into arcade and to do so they would really want to get a beefier chip in the apple tv
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.700]   I would love to see at 12z or something in the or a 14. Why not put a 14
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.860]   Into the next apple tv apple certainly could do it right larry
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.820]   Definitely and that's
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.700]   I can't believe that they haven't actually updated apple tv in as long as they have because they're
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.140]   Trying to get people on board with apple arcade and they're trying to get people on board with tv plus
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:29.580]   And a brand new apple tv with a the fastest processor you can get
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.460]   I think is gonna that's how you win people over
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.980]   I you know, I went on I got a 4k apple tv
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.580]   I think a year ago and it was because I had been waiting and waiting and waiting
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.940]   For a more updated apple tv that was more than just apple tv with 4k
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.300]   And then I finally just I just bought it because I was tired of waiting around but I I would have jumped
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.780]   at an brand new new processor
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.780]   um apple tv
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.100]   I've been very excited by that and and
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.860]   I think that's they need to do that they need to update it and rene's idea of a dongle based
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:10.380]   um apple tv I think is brilliant it would be maybe a little more limiting maybe less
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:17.580]   um space for stuff maybe less like no app store maybe just tv the tv app plus apple arcade or something like that
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.220]   You can get it for super cheap those who would be great for a lot of people like um
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.580]   I have people in my family who don't have apple tv
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.660]   But they do have that you know, they recently bought a new phone so they have tv plus
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.940]   And they don't they don't get to take advantage of the the use on a television set
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.460]   So they don't watch any of the tv shows
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.060]   They don't know anything about them because they don't they don't watch it
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.100]   They can't watch it on their television set they would have to watch it on their phone
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:50.380]   So a new apple tv that's really inexpensive would definitely bring more people on board to the servicing
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.940]   That that they make available that they're trying to you know generate a lot of money from
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:00.780]   My only question about a super more a much more powerful chip inside the apple tv is
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:06.060]   How much overhead are you going to give a user that they're probably never going to touch
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.740]   I have I have uh android tv at both ends of the spectrum
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.540]   I have the new chrome cast dongle 50 bucks probably could use a little bit more memory
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:19.180]   But it works just fine for streaming pretty much everything i've tested on it all the third party apps
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.300]   I've tested on it. I also have a hundred and eighty dollar
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.940]   Shield and vidya shield
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.700]   Which is more of a console and it's powerful enough to run i actually run a media another media server on it
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   And it'll run a web browser just fine
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.820]   The question is if they decide to put a much more faster chip inside the apple tv
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:43.740]   What features are they going to be able to add to it that will make people think oh, this is why I bought
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.220]   I spent more money for this version of it instead of the dongle version of it
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:55.580]   And I I really like to know like what people would would like to have in terms of a more powerful experience
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.980]   Beyond the beyond tier one games, which I realized is a big thing but for a lot of people
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.700]   I will they'll have an xbox one for that. That's the rumors. I guess i think of the
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.060]   Go ahead rene
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.980]   I was going to say that's the rumor. It was put up by choco bits on twitter who's you know, i'm fairly well established
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.820]   Uh, I think he works in the apple secondary supply market
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.780]   And he said that they were going to do an a 14x version because they want to get into higher quality gaming
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.620]   Things like breath of the wild
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:30.140]   But it raises a couple big questions for me one is they do need a more powerful chip because you can see the a 10x choke
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.980]   When it starts doing compositing on hdr
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.020]   It's like just at the edge for that so an a 12z for sure
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.740]   Whether they need an a 14x one thing is breath of the wild is a several generations old
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.220]   Nintendo game, which isn't that graphically
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.660]   Probably they could do that already. They don't really need much more firepower for nintendo switch quality games
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.500]   But also the market is so different when when you put an amd
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.460]   System on a chip inside an xbox or a playstation
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.580]   That's supremely expensive and they eat that cost because
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.860]   They want to keep prices down and I think they're going to make it up on software
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:06.300]   Which is the inverse of apple's model and an a 14x in an apple tv would be really expensive
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.260]   If apple just charged cost plus 30 percent and I don't know if apple would eat the cost
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:16.140]   And keep the price down because they they don't make it up on software. They use hardware to subsidize
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.940]   To subsidize the software. It's completely backwards
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:25.100]   So my whole question is would anybody pay apple tried this before before we got the everything is apps apple tv
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.100]   They were working on a high end one and they just thought nobody would pay that much for an apple tv
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.340]   And I I don't know what's changed about that equation
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:37.580]   So lori do you want to play as Zelda on your apple tv?
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:46.860]   Yeah, I do I the switch is such a success. I know what you want to play is animal crossing on your
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:53.660]   Of course, I'm not going to assume that apple and nintendo would come together under one roof of course
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:28:02.060]   But but no, I do think that apple like apple arcade is really producing incredible beautiful amazing
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:08.540]   Deep interesting games. I want apple tv to be the platform that everybody wants to use it on
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.860]   I don't want everybody to say I already got it on my phone. I don't need to watch play it on my tv
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.540]   I want people to think of apple arcade as a console
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:23.340]   For your television said even though it's you know in in the cloud and you can use it on anything
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.180]   Just because it deserves the kind that kind of attention these are mobile games
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:34.780]   But they're so impressive and creative and and beautiful they deserve to be played on a large screen. So yeah, I want
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.700]   I want
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.940]   I and again like rene is saying like it's it's not that it needs it
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.860]   Um, but the apple tv doesn't need the most advanced chip
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.860]   But that's what's going to make people want to buy it
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.420]   But I hear what you're saying rene
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:55.580]   The cost of the a 14 chip on an apple tv it would increase the price of apple tv people don't even want to pay
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:02.300]   It's already the current price of it. So they're not going to pay more. Yeah. I mean google's device is so cheap
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.580]   They're new chrome cast that if you buy a month of uh youtube tv you get it for free
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.620]   Otherwise you pay 50 bucks. It's cheap
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.460]   so uh
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.660]   apple spending a sending selling a 200 dollar device is already
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.340]   Kind of beyond the means of most people and after all
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:26.940]   I guess the real question is does apple see apple tv is a gaming platform or are they completely content to have the iphone and the ipad
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:33.420]   The ipad is a great gaming experience. You would love animal crossing or zelda on an ipad, right?
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.460]   Yes, that would be beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, not that that's ever
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.900]   I'd love game pass on an apple tv and stadia on an apple tv and amazon luna on an apple tv
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.980]   I just need apple to get over that
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.460]   And again, I don't think they're being I don't think they're being malicious about it. I just don't think they understand
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.940]   It's like they have this mental app store game store model that they just can't see past yet
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:59.260]   And when they do and they're like, oh, okay, we get it. Yeah, we want people to have the best experience possible with those services
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:08.060]   On apple products will sell all the hardware. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Also the apple tv is the closest thing to tofu that apple makes
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.380]   This thing that
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.380]   I
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:18.940]   Okay, I say streaming boxes they have no identity in and of themselves
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.780]   They take upon the flavors and the identity of the services that you tie into it
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:28.860]   And so if if you're if i'm in it best by really i'm the most if i'm an all apple person
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:36.780]   The most vulnerable i could possibly be is to a third party streaming dongler streaming box because it's not really tied into my apple
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.340]   Count all that much because i'm probably not buying content through the iTunes store anymore
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.500]   I really want that apple tv plus content, but maybe i haven't really gotten into that yet
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.980]   I really i'm much more interested in the mandalorian
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.780]   Which I can get as an app on anything else
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   So if if anything, this is a place where apple can say that
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.420]   I take that you take the attitude that the purpose of this box is to stream
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:05.340]   Is to be the most relevant point of access to your computer whatsoever and that if people are not necessarily
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.180]   Goot doing apple arcade at least apple still gets the win that when they pick up the remote and wake up their screen
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.900]   They get a big apple logo with a holy
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:20.540]   Landing page of here is apple content. Here is your apple music stream here are things we're recommending to you and oh by the way
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:25.020]   Here is our our voice assistant that has some alerts and some reminders for you
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:31.820]   So yeah, brine Renee is is right and that i don't i don't feel as though there's any downside to apple
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.980]   Making sure that this thing could do as much as possible
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.540]   Even if even if they wanted to have like a vnc client to say that yes
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.940]   You can use this as a second screen for your mac
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.180]   You can use this as a second screen for a windows machine
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:49.900]   Anything just please give us a hundred dollars and maybe let us distract you into maybe buying an apple tv plus subscription sometime
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.020]   Um
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.020]   air tags
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.260]   god, please
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.220]   Still
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.700]   If they don't look if they don't announce air tags one week from today
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.900]   They're not gonna announce air tags Georgia dials gonna jump through her screen and just run to kupertino
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:12.460]   Yeah, well now the thing is though like this the the evidence of air tags has appeared in
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:18.460]   coding that might not really matter right now, but to me it means it will exist
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.700]   It's just a matter of win
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.580]   So i don't know like saying that if they don't announce it at this point they're not announcing it
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:30.380]   I'm not sure. I still think it might be on the table. It's just maybe they're trying to figure out
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.700]   I wanted
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.700]   technology
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.660]   Has it has it been FCC approved yet? Do they have at least have the radios approved by the fcc
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.140]   That's a good question or the same you one chip
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:47.340]   I was about to say I was about to correct myself that if they're using the same chips or using and all the things that wouldn't need it
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.380]   But yet no lori's absolutely right there's there's too much evidence that they've got it in the pipeline, but it's like
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.620]   you're like
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.620]   Not only is this a really interesting idea
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:02.220]   This is something that apple could do flawlessly and with privacy and I will give you $50 for this just
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:08.460]   Sure point me to the slot where I need to put my 220s and a 10 and yeah, it's weird
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.060]   I mean, there's also the issue with um
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.940]   Some companies child
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   accusing
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.620]   apple of monopoly and like maybe they're just waiting on
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.540]   You know a little bit more hearing related stuff before they drop something like this because they know
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.860]   It's going to cause a lot of controversy
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:34.220]   Yeah, because they announced third party support for the find my network at wwdc
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.700]   And this would give those companies three months to make
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.420]   competing devices using apples on service
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.940]   And then they could announce the air tags a lot like craig could go up and explain air
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:48.380]   How the find my network works again and look at all our partners. It's not just air tags. It's all these things. So stuff at tile
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.620]   Here's your competition
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.020]   I don't think apple
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.020]   Is the type of company that would save uh
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.020]   We don't want to get in trouble with tile
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.380]   That doesn't seem like
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:06.540]   I'm gonna stand by my statement if they don't release it on tuesday then I question they're interested in you're right
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.300]   They put the u1 chip in the watch they put the u1 chip in the phone
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.860]   They put the u1 chip. It's in the ipad too, right?
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:18.140]   It's everywhere and the apple tv remote is supposed to be getting it as well because that thing is always in sofa cushions always
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:24.780]   So, I mean if there's anything we lose the most it's that remote. Yeah, I would say it's almost
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.300]   As much a sure thing
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.340]   They'll announce air tags is that they will announce the iphone 12
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:36.060]   I think this is it's now or never and if they don't announce it there must be some really serious technical
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.380]   They might be
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:47.740]   Yeah, it might be an airpower sort of situation where they they haven't perfected it yet
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:53.500]   But since they haven't actually announced it they don't have to get they don't have to like say sorry
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.900]   We're not gonna do it anymore because they never actually announced it
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:04.060]   So maybe if they again if they don't announce it next tuesday, which I really do think they will but I also just don't agree
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.220]   Leo that it's never going to be announced if they don't announce it tuesday. I think
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:13.660]   They if they don't it just means that they're they're going back to the drawing board and they're still doing some work on it
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.700]   And that we will see it eventually is it conceivable they'll say the watch is the tag
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.780]   By another one
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:31.500]   But though they have the capability within the ecosystem now to do it without any separate tag
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.340]   You just couldn't put you don't want to touch or watch to your keys. Oh, yeah, exactly. So
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.860]   I guess I mean I got to spare why not right?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:45.660]   You know, maybe maybe it's a health it maybe I was thinking that maybe it's a health and safety thing because
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:51.660]   Like it does if the renderings that we've seen are accurate it does look like a like a eucharist wafer
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.980]   So maybe it's a choking hazard for choking hazards for
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.220]   I'm just I'm
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.540]   Information I hope they put that label on
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:12.460]   Your pudrake, please open with caution choky hazard for catholics and some apiscopalian's just be careful. Yeah, not meant to be placed on the tongue
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.060]   Speaking of the um the body price no the event invite did you know that there's they there's an ar thing
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:27.180]   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to do it. So how do I do it? I've got it in front of me and I've got
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.060]   You know, I have I was not able to go to the web page. Oh, you have to do a web page
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:37.500]   Yeah, so you probably have to do it with safari too, right? So I can't do it because I'm not on the Mac
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.180]   On no, you need it on your eye. I think you need it on an ar kit device. You need it on an iPhone or an ipad
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.260]   Oh, I see so if I go
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.420]   But how do I get the invite do I go to apple dot com on this?
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.020]   Yes
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:57.180]   Apple dot com slash events and and it should just this is making that invitation so much less exclusive
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:05.340]   I mean, it's on their web page too and your personal invite doesn't even have it. So you're not special at all
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.740]   Your name is not even speed
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.980]   Also, I like to say our stuff. It's really really cool and on trend but
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.060]   Apple you need to like send me like an apple logo
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:20.140]   Like event tag that I can hang on my door knob with all the other event tags
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:26.620]   Because otherwise people don't think that I'm an industry insider. So how do I turn it on? I'm on I'm on the apple page
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.620]   And i think press and hold it
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.620]   press and hold
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.980]   And now something magical is happening. Yeah, so then press that little ar thing in the corner
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:44.300]   And I think in a minute when it loads it all can I put I could put the event in invitation on ambi andes head
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:50.860]   Yes, if you can get it to work. Yeah, probably can you should you? Oh look Andy. It's all they're all coming out
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.500]   Little little little party on andes head little invitations
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.460]   I don't know what's going on. It's not it's not
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:03.740]   I see it kind of you can actually switch over to object and it'll it'll just trigger because it doesn't need
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.500]   Anything to lay on to show it to you. So you can at least see what it looks like. Oh how exciting it's just a little
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.900]   It's yeah, oh you're playing all I'll I'll play it. Let's do that
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:23.820]   Ladies and gentlemen get ready for the most exciting thing that's ever happened in your life
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.940]   the
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.020]   Okay, do it. Well, it not do it in the airplane. Oh there it goes. Oh
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.700]   So this is like the you know what about
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.900]   I uh
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.620]   Airpaw what are they called? Sorry home pod mini. What do you think home pod mini
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.460]   You know because that looked like sort of like speaker exploding sound
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.740]   I just love speculating
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.820]   Yeah, it could be
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.140]   How do I find the date with my apple tag?
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.620]   Maybe those are the cups from the new airplot studios lorry all the different colors you can get
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.340]   Yeah, it's kind of like this molecular thing. Isn't that cool?
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.220]   Let me put it on my head maybe maybe well
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:14.700]   Maybe it's maybe it's going to be the apple silicon announcement because like they're saying if you've got like a lot of balls in the air
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:20.940]   That our new more powerful CPU will help you keep those balls in the air. I don't know. Okay. I'm
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.740]   It's happening, but it's not happening
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.580]   It's like dark for some reason. Yeah phone to start
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:35.100]   Ah stupid they are. What did anybody think it's becoming less delightful apple? It's less and less delightful
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.740]   If only you had it as glasses and not as a phone
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.780]   So, uh
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.260]   No glasses. Maybe that's what's going to happen. Maybe we get air glasses one more thing
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.500]   This is kind of dopey
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.980]   I'm
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   I'm not still on the
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.300]   You're not wrong
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.820]   Renee what if no, I just got like a thought what you know how like
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:07.980]   Steve was like secretly like live testing the keynote presentation app for months before they actually in front of a life
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.220]   Instead of front of everybody before they actually announced it
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:16.060]   What what if Tim has actually been like testing apple glass like in every single public appearance
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.100]   And we just didn't know it
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:19.900]   By the way
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.740]   Wasn't it earlier this year that he was wearing a new pair of glasses that he had that beautiful blue rim glasses
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.820]   And he didn't used to wear that
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.220]   So
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:36.540]   If you remember it also had that like eight gauge coaxial cable going from the left temple to a box
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:44.620]   That is so sad poor guy gets a new frame and everybody's going crazy over it
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:50.140]   By the way, we should look so good on him the new glasses that he was wearing or I think it was
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.300]   Was it I don't even remember what event it was it could have been WWDC
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.900]   But it might have been before that and they just looked so good on him. So
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:03.900]   That poor guy on tick tock has to upgrade now. He can't just keep doing his good morning from kubertino
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.460]   Tick tock without actually
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:13.660]   I'm speaking seriously now. This is the first time this thought has occurred to me that the stakes for like an apple wearable apple glasses
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.060]   are very very high because
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.340]   of
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.460]   Tim
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.900]   You know, Tim wears glasses like like like a lot of us on his panel
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.780]   We wear glasses and if they try to sell these with the point of view that hey
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.860]   These aren't just like something you'll just put on for gaming or just put on for you'll want to actually
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.460]   They're so natural and so so lightweight. You'll want to wear them all the time
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:39.500]   Tim can afford to like have an apple watch on his wrist every single time
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.180]   He can afford to like have an iPhone in his pocket every single time
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.340]   But are they are they really going to release these until Tim can say wait
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.380]   Huh on gee Tim. I know that you're not wearing your apple glasses
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.260]   Why aren't you wearing your apple glasses if they're so great the apple glasses?
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:58.940]   You don't want to be without them apple glasses. I do have to point out your apple glasses that the glasses jaws is wearing
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:05.020]   Look very similar and if you aim your iPhone at his shirt
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.980]   It will explode you can see a horse
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.180]   You can see a horse
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.180]   Those are the photo of his iPhone screen today and everyone's like those bezels look too thin
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.340]   Not too small
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.340]   Tosses and leak on Twitter. Yeah
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.660]   He's had experience at this. He knows what he knows not to do that
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.140]   So I should mention that yesterday was the 11th
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   Sorry ninth anniversary of the passing of Steve Jobs in 2011 and Tim Cook did
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.340]   Post a beautiful tweet
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.820]   A great soul never dies. It brings us together again and again Maya Angela
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.820]   You're always with us Steve your memory connects and inspires us every day
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:51.420]   And Steve is definitely not wearing augmented reality glasses. I could tell you that right now
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:57.820]   So he's already he's already seeing eight years under the future. Yeah, he sees the future through those glasses
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:04.140]   Uh, let's take a little break and we will talk more about what is to come a week from today
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:12.300]   Uh, also some security news about the t2 chip that's worrying me just a little tiny maybe maybe news maybe not news
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.340]   We'll see our show today brought to you by extra hop. You should be worried if your
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:22.380]   Businesses in the cloud these days, right? Uh, the new it reality
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.780]   Remote access
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:30.220]   On a massive scale and all workers are going home right rapid cloud and multi cloud adoption
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:36.860]   Of course a steady increase in internet of things devices all on top of a rise in cybercrime
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.780]   In a post compromise world. It's more important than ever
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:46.300]   That organization see everything going on in their environment from the cloud to the data center to the customer
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:52.460]   But in order to prevent an incident from becoming a full-scale data breach you need more than unified visibility you need
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:58.460]   The context for detections so that you can respond intelligently you need workflows
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:07.020]   So teams can collaborate easily and act quickly and all of that is what extra hop gives you extra hop it stops breaches 70
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:14.460]   Faster by eliminating blind spots. It's really it's really a view into your entire
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:21.100]   Network how it's performing where the threats are it's cloud threat detection and response
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.300]   It's security and it tool consolidation
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.540]   It detects threats other tools miss to keep your business secure and available
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:36.380]   Extra hop is a sass based cloud native network detection and response tool that is beloved by its customers
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:43.180]   Just ask dan mcdaniel. He's chief architect and information security officer at wizards of the coast
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:48.300]   They use a ws and of course they secure it and support it with extra hop
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:54.700]   Dan mcdaniel said there's no other company that aligns to supporting the dev ops model the speed and the lack of friction
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.980]   Then extra hop there you see alta beauty
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:04.060]   Uh, they use extra hops to secure their google cloud and of course because they have branches all over the world
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:09.980]   They keep networking and security teams on top of things so engineers can focus on innovation
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.460]   And know that their network is secure
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:19.500]   John crease senior it engineer at alta says before extra hop we had limited visibility into what was going on in the cloud
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:26.220]   But now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits and understand how our applications are performing in the cloud
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:31.580]   So it's both really its performance and its threat detection. It's something you really need
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.820]   You really want um, and if you want to know more
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:42.140]   Including how extra hop detects ripple 20 vulnerabilities. That's on everybody's mind right now
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:49.740]   Learn more about extra how extra hop stops breaches 70 percent faster. There's a great free trial waiting for you in a demo too
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.140]   Uh, you really like how it looks i think you'll really enjoy it extra hop
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.020]   Dot com slash twit extra hop
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.780]   Dot com
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.420]   Slash twit, please use that url let them know you saw it here and we thank extra hop so much
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.980]   for supporting mac break weekly
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.540]   Sometimes you know these
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:14.620]   Cloud security companies these enterprise companies say oh apple people aren't interested, but extra hop new there a lot
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:19.100]   I know there are a lot of you listening responsible for giant networks
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.500]   Um, so we thank you for supporting us and extra hop at the same time
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.780]   on we go with the show
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:31.260]   Didn't mean to bring you down with that uh, tim cook tweet, but I thought it was worth no
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:38.060]   Yeah, absolutely. I will never forget that day. Uh, we were doing a triangulation
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:45.100]   And uh, it was with somebody who had worked with uh, steve kevin marks. That's right. He'd worked at apple on a quick time
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:49.900]   And uh, we got the news horrible news kevin. Thank goodness was there
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:55.580]   Uh, we broke and we did we just did a lot of coverage. I think we must have done seven or eight hours of nonstop
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.820]   Um remembering steve coverage. It was really good. So
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.020]   Uh, a researcher has claimed
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:10.540]   That the t2 security chip which is in the latest models is on my iMac pro. It's in the mac pro
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.460]   Uh, it does a lot. It's more than just a security chip
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.380]   Uh, but it also you know as the disc controller a lot more
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.420]   Um, it is your secure enclave. It's your secure boot
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:28.780]   Uh, security researcher niell's hoffman says because it's based on an a 10
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:37.740]   Processor it's vulnerable to the same checkmate exploit. That's the one you may remember that allowed people to jailbreak
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.380]   the iphone
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.580]   So should I be worried rene riche
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:50.140]   No, it was interesting to me is that will saffic traffic who's a really well-known security researcher
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.220]   He does really probably the best vpn
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:57.260]   Uh client on the market does a lot of privacy research. He woke up looked at the news coverage and said, oh my god
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:05.420]   What is happening here? Uh, it's it's something to I don't want to write with but the the disclosure wasn't great
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.700]   And the reporting wasn't great. It is it is something but it's not something that people should worry about yet
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.540]   And if you go through at chronic on twitter, he's on a really good breakdown
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:20.860]   On all of this and the the check rain developer just weighed in you would need physical access to the device, right?
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.100]   You have to do a dsu
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.820]   You have to have a failed
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.220]   If you have a fatal error in the dfu
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.900]   Um
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.060]   If then you have to you they're using a vulnerability you have to jump in
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:39.500]   You have to inject a payload probably through a usb device. That's that's but so it's somebody's
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.620]   Maybe
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.940]   But again, like the like the beginning part is okay, but there's no proof that this actually
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.740]   You need in order to work and needs to sustain a reboot and there's no actual evidence. It does that
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.980]   It's not even a known working exploit. It's just a blog post. It's just a potential
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.740]   Okay, the check rain developer just wrote that people should really chill down
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   Just really chill down. I haven't had that one before chill down regarding this exploit
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.740]   Vulnerability has been public for more than a year now and always has been there on the t2
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:12.380]   More over there are plenty of other vulnerabilities including remote ones that undoubtedly have more impact on security
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:17.020]   Well, yes, if there's a remote vulnerability to t2, I'd like to know about that one
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.820]   Yeah, but so the the um
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.820]   The big part about this is that it doesn't it's not known to actually work yet
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.820]   It's it's something that some people are reporting on and amplifying over and over again
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.860]   And we know that that you can jailbreak
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.980]   Uh the t2 chip because it really is an a 10 chip
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:39.660]   Uh, but there's no proof that it subsets after that and there's no proof that anything else along the excellent chain works
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.540]   You wouldn't necessarily gain any advantage. You just jailbroken
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:47.500]   Yeah, well, I mean if it reboots and it goes back to normal then there's no real
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.500]   There's no real there there
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:56.540]   It's just like if they happen to have your computer for an extended period of time like a nation state or like, you know a federal agency
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:04.540]   You know, maybe they could use this to pull some data off every time they get in before they reboot, but it's it's really unclear how damaging it is
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.700]   Here's the question if i'm using file vault
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.780]   Would it allow them to decrypt my file vault encryption?
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.820]   Not immediately and it's not it's not proven that they could
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:21.900]   They could sustain long enough to get the keys off of the machine even if they got in because that's the only thing that would scare me
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.220]   if they got into the machine fine, but
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:30.380]   If they could they need to decrypt my file and everybody uses file vault now with a t2. It's it's on by default
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:36.700]   So yeah, they would need to be able to decrypt that encrypted volume before they get into anything
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.300]   And they have to be on that too. Yeah, all right
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:46.700]   So i'm not saying that they haven't investigated the design yet to see if there's enough there to extract the keys and these are the smartest info sec people in the world
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:52.140]   Okay, I wish that I wish the press would really talk to them before hitting publish. He would just save us all so much
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:57.820]   Well, you know, like my mom asking me we talked to you so that you can tell us on their bed
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.180]   That's the first thing I do and I also for tolorious credit like her writers
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:06.700]   They were all they were a huge discussion about this this morning and we're going over all of this is just it behooves everybody
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.060]   Yeah
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:12.060]   To be fair, this is part of a discussion that we didn't have to have five or ten years ago
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.220]   We could almost dismiss these sort of
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.580]   Assume let's let's assume that that this is one of the hacks that actually works and is practical
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:25.180]   They we used to be able to sort of dismiss a lot of these mornings with oh, yeah
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:29.260]   But this person is to be effective someone would actually have to have physical access to your phone
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.620]   And that doesn't make it completely irrelevant, but that means okay
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.820]   So we don't have to think about it
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:38.460]   But now in the environment that we're in right now the idea of oh well
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:42.700]   There was a protest and someone and a law enforcement officer took my phone away
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:48.060]   Or I was at a security checkpoint at an airport and another country and once again
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.340]   They took my lap they what they wanted me to hand over my phone for 10 minutes
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:57.740]   Now it becomes you becomes more important to be aware of what kind of tools might be in the arsenal of
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.620]   some organization that might want to
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:08.460]   Slurp all your information out of your phone or in more intense cases might want to put some software on your phone that you would not
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:15.260]   Really approve of the rest the iPhone used to be the phone where I don't have I don't feel as though I need to automatically
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:23.580]   Factory reset my phone before handing it over to somebody it might become more relevant to think that I'm not going to take the chance
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:28.940]   These it's it's it becomes more important than to simply someone trying to brute force
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.540]   A pasco right now and that's something that people at least need to be aware of
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:41.020]   Um, you might want to teach you chip if you like to watch Netflix because I guess I guess you won't be able to watch Netflix
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:47.340]   Without and 4k without a t2 chip. So that means you have to have really a pretty late model
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:53.020]   Macbook pro Macbook air Mac mini if you have a Mac pro or iMac pro you'd be okay
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.980]   Uh, you have to have the new iMac the t2 chip is is fairly recent
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:05.340]   Uh-huh. Yeah, so that's important apple does have well it's an ssd controller and the my mac didn't weren't all ssd until this year
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:09.100]   Oh, well there. Yeah. It doesn't work on on pliers. Yeah
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:15.180]   Where do you think this demand came from do they became it came from netflix directly or from content providers surviving
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:19.100]   Providing stuff to netflix I would well of course. Yeah netflix probably doesn't care
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.420]   but i'm sure they are
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:25.100]   Enjoined by their contracts with movie companies to make sure that
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:31.500]   They because they're terrified, you know, hollywood's terrified of piracy that there's no way to pirate netflix
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:36.300]   Video it's interesting because you still would get the 1080p just wouldn't get the 4k version
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:44.060]   And also the performance is way better because you depending on the codec they use you get up to 30 times speed boosts from using the t2 chip
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:48.540]   The code maybe it's really not a security thing. Maybe it's just probably both
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.940]   I mean, I'm sure they're wrapping it up as tight as can be so that you know, there's no casual
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.980]   Anyone who wants it will still get it, but there'll be no casual piracy
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:02.300]   There's no way to stop here playing it on your iMac and videotaping it with your camcorder
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:07.260]   Ridiculous like you can't even take a screenshot on your iphone of a movie anymore
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:11.180]   That people would share that they'd mean that it would be so much fun
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.300]   And they shut it down to a point where it's ludicrously bad for them
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:20.540]   Yeah, they're just so not only that but it's part of the ongoing assault on fair use doctrine and copyright
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:26.380]   They've made they locked things down so tight that it becomes we do have the right of fair use for copyright
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.580]   But guess what let's say that you if i'm if i'm going to make a
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.340]   A review or even a political statement regarding a documentary
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.660]   I can't use an eight second clip from there because it will get content struck all
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.220]   Completely completely immediately
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:45.660]   Uh, and so what's what's the point of us having the ability to take a frame from a movie
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.220]   And use that as a way of illustrating a point or
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:55.420]   Increasing the conversation about this subject if we can't even grab one frame from a move from a move by doing a screenshot
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.900]   Unless unless these people think that I can I can
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:04.780]   Screenshot at 30 frames per second and then put it into the premier and reconstruct the movie
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:11.100]   It's just it's just not acceptable. You probably really can't watch Terminator 2 without a t2 chip. I would guess
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.540]   Good one leo
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.620]   And be sure to and be sure to use your liquid metal sim extractor
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.900]   Oh, yeah
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.900]   They had liquid
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:29.820]   The only thing they ever made was a sim tool. What the hell? Yeah, that that that something should always ground us that
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.260]   We're talking because we're talking about we were talking about rumors. That's a fun thing
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.260]   It's a fun broad subject that oh well
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:41.020]   They they've got these patents on liquid metal and what could they do with a with this technology in an iPhone case room
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:47.260]   And really that's the only thing we ever saw that used that metallurgical technology was this little like
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.220]   Thing you could pick your teeth with or extract a sim with
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:55.020]   And frankly, it's not that much different than just a non-liquid metal thing
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:57.900]   I mean, it's not like a
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:02.300]   I have liquid metal
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:09.500]   Uh what you won't have if you go to the apple store is bozo no sir logitech headphones. They've all disappeared
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:16.220]   From the apple store. What is that mean? We need to know the homes leo. We need to know the homes on this case immediately
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.540]   Um, is it foolish to say that that implies that apples perhaps
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:25.260]   Air studio. What do they call them studio ears airpods studio?
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:31.100]   Is a lovely picture of uh, oh, I don't know where you got this model rene of some
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:36.140]   Gorgeous woman wearing her wait a minute. Those are beats nevermind
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.540]   Oh, the beats are being planted even through the screen shot
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.020]   if uh
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:47.980]   If the if the air pod studio looked kind of like beats, I would be so happy
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.820]   But you've seen the renders of the supposedly x right? No
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:56.860]   I don't like the way they look. Are they on the air over there? They're very um
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:03.100]   Plain I mean old time. You would just get a little time. It'll look better
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:10.380]   They're like rounded. They aren't round their rounded rectangles with like wire work
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:13.340]   And it looks almost like a broad made it set of headphones
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:18.140]   Right, it's it's very simple and not my style
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:24.140]   Like if i'm gonna wear a big old thing over my head. I want it to be pretty cool looking and it looks
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:30.620]   It reminds me of something that maybe was popular in the 70s in that sort of like
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.740]   Your dad like doctor who
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:39.740]   It had you know, like your dad has this amazing entertainment center that he uses these like big
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.100]   Studio quality looking headphones. It's it's like
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.980]   Yeah, I mean
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.340]   Okay, you're not allowed to touch even though you promise you're gonna be really really careful with it
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.940]   You're only gonna stay in it
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.340]   Which by the way, I have those headphones that my dad wouldn't let me touch as a kid in my closet
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.340]   I got him from him as an adult
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.020]   I have
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:03.980]   The one of the few things that I absolutely insisted that I get from like my parents house when we
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:10.220]   Unfort when they passed away. We show everything down is I want dad's camera kit because i look who's holding the camera now
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.900]   Oh really so you both feel
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:19.420]   Like slighted his dad wouldn't let you i'm trying to think what it was. I wouldn't let my kids
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.860]   Do they couldn't look at my playboys. That's for sure
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:30.460]   But like you didn't have any kind of technology that you like they were not allowed to touch because you were worried they were gonna
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:37.580]   No, because you know, I'm a little less precious about technology because I have so much of it, right? Yeah, it's not
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:43.100]   It's like oh you can't touch that. It's too the Mustang. No, I let Henry
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:49.500]   I even let him drive the Tesla. Here's the ugly pictures from prosser of the
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:57.100]   I mean, they're really they're ugly. They're just very plain. It looks like you're wearing altoid tins on your ears
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:02.220]   Supposedly change out. They had the ear muff parts for different colors and looks and and the under the
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:09.260]   Can I just make it all magnetic in a year from now? We'll look at these and go god. Why don't all headphones look this good
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:13.580]   I know we got used to I know we got used to the air pods
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.860]   They were made fun of to know and and now people are just used to them and they're even like, you know
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:25.740]   Sawed after the design itself. So that's true. I I guess I just really wanted it to be
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:33.980]   fun and I should have known that apple is is you know, there's such you know, their design aesthetic is is not
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.740]   Garish so I should have assumed that they were going to be a little bit more
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.420]   Demure about the style, but I was hoping it would be kind of a
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.460]   I don't know something
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.460]   Yeah, have I don't know
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.620]   But it's it's if they're really competing with higher end headphones
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:54.220]   That's that's the aesthetic of like 300 400 or 500 headphones. There's a point
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:58.300]   They're there. It says oh, this is classy. We this is clear
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.940]   There's not we would put more stuff on it if we were
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.580]   Uh, if we were just trying to give you something that has thumpy thumpy thumpy thumpy base. No, no, no
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.580]   These are studio monitors
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.020]   Well, you know, I'm slapping stickers all over mine though
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:15.340]   Mr. Prosser also suspects it won't just be
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.500]   Airpods studio headphones on Tuesday, but maybe new home pod
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.300]   speakers mini
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.660]   mini
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.660]   a little a little baby version
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.260]   I got reviews for their little mini
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:35.900]   Google voice speakers people say it sounds very good for the size its fabric covered is a lozenge
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.700]   It's all about algorithms now leo. We've we're transcending atoms and the bits are taking over
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:45.740]   We're doing things beyond what the physical it's so weird. Well, it's about it's a lot of it
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.820]   Is about hitting the sweet spot where that's that's put a lot of the I do have one
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.820]   It sounds really nice
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:58.220]   But what really struck me is that I also have like the what was originally the four hundred dollar google home max
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.220]   And it's very very good
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:05.660]   But this is and I realized this is new $99 speaker was released a few years later. So we're seeing
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:09.900]   Technologically advantages. Don't tell me it sounds as good as the max
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.700]   No, it doesn't it doesn't sound as good as the max what i'm getting at is that it's it's it's the sweet spot of
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:20.300]   Do people want to spend $800 for a pair of stereo speakers? No, they don't
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.460]   Do they want to spend $200 for a pair of stereo speakers?
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:29.340]   Yes, and if these sound as good as like a $400 or $500 set boy
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:36.620]   That's a huge win particularly when you consider that you can buy one of these for $99 to just be your little office screaming music thing
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.940]   But then as time goes by you find yourself adding a second and a third and a fourth
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.460]   For not only to increase the presence of music in your house
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:48.620]   But also to pair these things up and that's where I think it's really good design
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:56.300]   And that's where I I certainly hope that apple decides to look at where the market has gone for smart speakers over the past three or four years
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.260]   And decide that perhaps a single
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:06.060]   $400 speaker that we can then do lots of videos about with camera tracking moves and talk about dynamic range
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:11.100]   Isn't as valuable as something that people will actually buy because it sounds really good
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.980]   There's enough volume. There's enough presence and they can actually afford it and I mean it's
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:20.300]   A vision apple hasn't done anything with the speaker since then that's all
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:26.940]   So like the original is like the the thing that keeps getting me is that apple started the homepot project five years before we saw it
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.820]   And the whole goal was you don't have any audio in the room
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.900]   You're supposed to be able to walk in drop this little box
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:37.100]   And no matter where you drop it or where you stand it'll give you great sound throughout the entire room
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.220]   And then they're like, oh it has no screen. I guess we'll just use Siri for it
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:45.100]   And it took them so long to develop that this entire home speaker market home assistant market took off
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.300]   And suddenly like the assistant part was the thing everyone cared about
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:53.260]   And they brought a $500 speaker to a home assistant to a hundred dollar home assistant flight
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:59.180]   And by reducing it they they're basically removing everything that they originally thought that product should be because
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.940]   A small home pod mini is not going to fill a room no matter where you put it
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.260]   And I don't know if they just bite that bullet and say, okay, it's just it's just going to be a speaker
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.180]   And if you want to fill a room you can buy three of them or two of them or whatever
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:16.060]   But it feels like that this is something where they have to apply that second generation
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:22.300]   We learned so much and give people more of the product they wanted than the product apple initially sought out to create
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:31.580]   Yeah, no amount of it there. I'll just go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. I think the home pod mini idea is an absolute genius idea as a
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.700]   Panion to a home pod. So I've got the two home pods paired to my television set
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:42.620]   They are my stereo audio for my television set, but I also have so work pretty well
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:50.220]   There's always there's a lot of times where it drops out and you have to reconnect the pods and I have not figured out
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:56.060]   Like any reason why that would keep happening. It's really easy to repair it. You just you know
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:02.780]   Find it in your little air air play thing when you press and hold the home button
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:08.060]   It's easy to repair it, but it drops off of pretty much every single app every time I turn on the television
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:14.140]   I have to repair them. So it's a little frustrating. Oh my god. Yeah, it's a little frustrating
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:19.820]   Yeah, they should just have a setting unless you make it permanent like I want to dedicate these home pods to this TV
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.500]   That's well. I mean you you would think that that's what's happening like
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.540]   I don't know I there's just there's always been something technologically wrong with the way
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.740]   They the home pods pair with the television set
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.780]   It should be that they are the default always connected pods
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:43.420]   That's that's the way to set up with the earpods because I had a caller on the radio show complaining about that
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:49.340]   I don't use headphones with my television set. So I can't speak to that. I don't know how
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:53.420]   How well or poorly that that connection works
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:57.500]   But my point was about the home pod mini though
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:05.100]   I I would love to have another speaker in the kitchen and another speaker in the office and another speaker in the bedroom
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.060]   just to have them that they're not part of my
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:15.180]   stereo setup for my home pods another reason I don't use my home pods for music very often because
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:21.020]   I keep hoping that they're not going to disconnect from my television set so I don't mess with that
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:28.380]   But if I have a bunch of little ones around the house that I can connect my phone to or I can just announce that I want to listen to something
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:33.740]   I'm I am on board with that. I would love to have a bunch of less expensive less
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:42.060]   High quality speakers for smaller areas and then the two the two home pods that I have set up from my apple television
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:43.820]   my apple tv
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.420]   They can stay
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:50.940]   Isolated to the living room and even though it's a pain in the butt. I'm telling you I have never heard
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:06:00.540]   Home stereo audio sound as good as it does with this home pods and just like was rene is saying like it sends these things out in this beautiful
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.980]   Room-filling way that it just it's it's a it's amazing that it can do it
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.180]   Sometimes they'll be like a like a movie where a you know a chirp or a sound
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:18.220]   Takes place to the left of the of the movie and it'll startle me because I thought I had just heard something in the other room because it's so
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:23.180]   Clearly coming from that side of the room, you know, so they're really good. I
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:28.860]   Have you tried this facial audio on the air pods pro lorry? I've been waiting till you talk about it. It is so
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.540]   amazing
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:35.420]   It's I it's I it. How does this how does that why is this happening?
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:41.100]   It's that's what I do. It says how is that even possible? It's amazing
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:49.420]   Is it I think the under the underlying lesson to all this is that it's great to have like best in class audio quality
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.900]   But that's not necessarily what's gonna cause cause the greatest customer satisfaction
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:58.700]   It's it's so great. It's so great to hear you talk about lorry how you're using these speakers because
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:04.060]   Obviously, like I said, I've got the I've got google home x my whole idea was that oh, well
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.980]   This is gonna I'm gonna pair up these speakers and that's gonna be like my bedroom speakers
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.220]   I don't necessarily want to have like a I don't want to have an amplifier. I don't want to have all this stuff
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.460]   I just want really really good sound and they sound great
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:19.900]   But you talk again getting back to the idea of google being run like an unlicensed nail salon
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:25.340]   So that have a I have an android tv tv dongle, okay
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:30.380]   Google Chromecast which is made by the same company that does android tv
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.460]   These google home mac speakers which work with google chromecast
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:39.260]   And we're also made by the same company that made the chromecast and the android tv
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:47.420]   Guess what? I can't simply tell the android tv. Hey, please use these chromecast speakers as your default pair of speakers
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.420]   You can't do it
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.820]   I can do the way I could do it is by turning it into a bluetooth speaker and I can't do that as a stereo set
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:58.620]   And like that is such the don't that was so disappointed by that and it's so great to
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.420]   it's like
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:08.060]   Same thing is happening on the apple and it's it's it's a it's a disconnect that you it should be it should work
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.540]   It's not that they didn't include that
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:16.140]   It's that whatever the connection is it's just not it doesn't work. It just keeps falling out
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:19.660]   So yeah, it's not a google thing. It's it happens everywhere
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.300]   Apple is bad at it too
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.340]   I had and I had the same sort of problems with these speakers where they would drop off or they were just suddenly disconnect or something
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.340]   Stupid would happen like that and I've ever tried like
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:38.220]   Factory resetting both of them to sort of force both of them to do like a firmware update at the same time because that was the only thing that's
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.500]   That's the only thing that solved my drop-off problems with my google home stuff
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.140]   I like this idea. I think i'm gonna go do that right after this episode
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:53.420]   I I could definitely it's for some reason the volume will sometimes turn up and down on my home pods while i'm watching a movie
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:59.020]   Just randomly. I like to pretend that it's because I have a ghost, but it's really just you have an apple
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.740]   I I have to say the biggest problem I have with our home pod
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.940]   It's very it's near our tv is that for some reason schlomo just thinks everything's about her
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:13.820]   And constantly yeah constantly is waking up saying what huh?
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:19.500]   Yeah, I don't know what you're thinking about it and sometimes it's like nothing. It's like nothing approaching the trigger ward was said
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.740]   What are you even doing seriously?
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.100]   The triggers it. I'm sorry if I triggered any of you at home
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.260]   But that's one reason I would also be hesitant to use a home pod as a tv speaker
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:35.260]   I guess what we ended up doing and you i'm sure you must do this is we we tell it not to pay any attention to the trigger word, right?
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.260]   You can I don't I don't do that
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:44.380]   No, it it used to be pretty bad, but now I mean it used to happen daily and more often than daily on at some point
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.780]   Still using these as your tv speakers
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:55.260]   Well, I don't have any other tv speakers. So I would have to listen through my television set
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.060]   Which is terrible. So we should get our speakers
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.060]   Speaking of serious we're gonna take a little time out and then talk about that
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:05.500]   I I did want to mention and I hope this isn't going to be upsetting to you
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.980]   Um, and even halo has passed away at the age of 65
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.660]   Oh crap, he had throat cancer, but um
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.820]   Yeah, so it was not unexpected, but still he's very young
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:26.140]   An absolute innovator. There was a reason why he did not he often did not let himself be videoed or photographed facing facing the camera because
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:31.740]   His he wanted to protect his technique. That's wild. I didn't know that wow. Yeah, so good
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.540]   Anyway, so a moment of silence
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:41.020]   This episode of mac break weekly is brought to you by world wide technology
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:46.540]   AKA ww t it's one of the top technology solution providers in the world
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.900]   delivering business and technology outcomes to large private and public organizations
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:59.660]   all over the globe ww t is in the business of digital transformation and you couldn't find a better partner to help you make that
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:06.060]   Transformation especially if you're looking to adopt a multi cloud architecture. That's a challenge
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:12.540]   I think everybody understands that the clouds the future people are reluctant though to put all their eggs in one basket
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.940]   So multi cloud is very appealing
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:20.540]   But you've got to have a partner that really understands that the pit falls the ways to do it that are
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:27.180]   Safe secure effective and that's what ww t's therefore they stay with you every step of the way
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.300]   from your initial cloud vision
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:37.580]   Planning the strategy to cloud enablement migration to optimization and management and everything in between
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:44.620]   And that's where you want the expert t's their cloud consultants will sit down with you to formulate that vision and the strategy
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:50.060]   And they know that you know, and by the way, this is really important. You might talk to other people
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.380]   Who don't understand this?
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.380]   The investment pays off
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.260]   Only to the degree that aligns with your business goals. You don't do cloud just because it's cloud
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:03.420]   It's got to fit your needs your goals and that's where ww t
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.420]   Really is fantastic through briefings and workshops
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:14.700]   They already help some of the world's largest organizations unravel the complexities of the cloud to unlock business opportunities
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.060]   Their experts in cloud migration and application development
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.260]   They can create a secure landing zone in any cloud with on-demand labs and their beautiful
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:29.820]   Atc their advanced technology center that give organizations access to tools for things like microservices
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:35.420]   Cloud native development once you're up in the cloud ww t helps you manage it optimize it
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:42.380]   Because cloud frankly it's a continuum you don't just do it and and forget about it. It requires constant attention to detail
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:49.100]   That's where ww t can help whether your strategy calls for a cloud native hybrid cloud or on-prem resource
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:55.580]   Ww t's there for you. They work closely with intel to optimize for the latest cloud smart solutions
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.100]   Based on intel technology for security
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:05.980]   Performance and agility and of course when you say intel you got a you got to mention the intel obtained persistent memory
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:11.340]   Really impressive technologies other great intel technologies workload optimized
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:18.540]   To deliver affordable large capacity and data persistence for solutions supporting everything from vdi to data analytics

[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.940]   So I want to actually speaking of syria. I want to talk a little bit about
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:08.300]   Neil cybarts uh article we love above avala on his blog and Neil is a great
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.460]   innovator and he
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:16.060]   Uh are a great uh analyst. I would should say he talks a little bit about he's talking about the apple watch
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:23.420]   He's talking a little bit about uh, and I was I fell for this back a few years where everybody said the next big
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.740]   Category is going to be these
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:30.540]   Speakers that you can talk to the amazon echo the google voice
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.220]   Nobody said about about the home pod, but but you know the same idea
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.860]   uh, and he says you know
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:43.420]   Court kind of even even then he called it the stationary smart speaker mirage
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.260]   He said the smart speakers and this is in 2017
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:53.500]   So he was very astute. He says smart speakers end up competing with a seemingly unlikely product category
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:15:00.380]   Wearables and in fact, that's what apples always said is that we really ever I guess johnny i've really said
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:06.140]   This is where this is where schlomo should live is in your apple watch on your wrist
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:11.180]   not on some your field versus far field debate some stationary speaker somewhere
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.860]   and uh
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.380]   Neil's taking a little victory lap because it's it's pretty clear
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:23.340]   That apple watch is a massive success. He estimates 35 percent of us iphone owners
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.300]   Wear an apple watch more than a third
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:34.780]   Um, he says that's just gonna keep growing too. Yeah, I think you're right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, 75 percent this year especially last year. Yeah
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:41.420]   So that means 81 million people wearing an apple watch as at the end of june
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.980]   Uh, yeah 75 going to first time customers
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.620]   I love how grumpy he gets like he gets so angry because like he'll see an article in the verge where they're like
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:56.700]   Oh, this the amazon echo is selling so well. Oh, the apple watch is beleaguered and he's like apple watch sold 18 times more
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:02.140]   What does the matter with you data? Look at data. There are numbers here. He says that for the wall street journal
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:10.060]   He'll just you'll go cracker in 2020 almost as many people will have bought their first apple watch as the entire fit bit customer base
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:17.820]   Uh apple watch install base is increasing by the size of fit bits overall install base every 12 months
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.780]   Uh, here's uh, here's the graph
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:26.300]   And uh that that that sure looks like uh, it's linear, but it looks like pretty strong
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:31.420]   Growth year over year now apple does not release these numbers. So these are based on his own
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.140]   Calculations, then he also and we've talked about this before he also mentions
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:42.460]   But I think this is pretty astute the grand unified theory of apple products
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.940]   So at the top
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:50.700]   The mac pro push the boundaries of a computer right below it the mac book prose
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:55.740]   Handle tasks formerly given to mask desktops right below it
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.460]   iPads handle tasks formerly given to the mac right below it
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:08.780]   iPhone handle tasks formerly given to the ipad and the mac right below that apple watch airpods handled tasks
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:13.340]   Formally given to the iphone does that seem like an accurate portrayal?
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.380]   That's the phil Shiller diet like he's phil
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:21.420]   Schiller has this incredibly famous slide that he used to keep internal but apple put it up a couple times as a graphic
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.900]   They even made a shirt out of it. You can get a shirt with it on
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.300]   Sometimes at apple, but he has this thing
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.780]   There's the Schiller doctrine which says that
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:33.020]   Every product has to push against the next highest up product
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:37.580]   So it's literally the job of the apple watch to push the iphone the iphones job to push the ipad
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:45.260]   The ipads dropped to push the mac and then those products jobs to push back in order to prove why they still need to exist
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:51.580]   Oh, I like and that's how he was driving the teams and marketing was like you have to eat the functionality of whatever is the next best
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.860]   Device and then when he would tell the other people you better not let them catch up, but there's no reason to keep you around
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:01.580]   It's worked. It's a virtuous circle. That's for sure. It's worked very well
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:05.500]   I'm not sure I'd call it a flywheel. It's not quite a flywheel
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.820]   It's more like the bigger fish
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.660]   It's the little fish eats the little fishy. So it's what happened with watches, right?
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:16.460]   Like we had talent we had huge watch towers in town square then we had grandfather clocks in our living room
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.620]   And then we had bedside clocks and then we had pocket watches and then finally we had watches
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:26.380]   On our wrists. It just it's what happens with technology and apple's doing a really good job of replicating that
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.940]   With computers but taking it the next step and now we have computers in our ears like a tech
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:36.620]   We have 10 core audio processing units in our ears, which is just a silly amount of compute power for something not small
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:41.900]   Yeah, I I have to say that I think that that explanation that he offered was
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:45.900]   A little shaky and definitely not unique to apple
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.300]   I think that it is the nature of innovation to say here is a really popular product
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.340]   What is it not doing well and what's frustrating the hell out of people about it?
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.140]   And is there a need that we can fill with something brand new?
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:01.260]   It's not it's not so much a case of a linear this product is taking away functionality from this
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:05.900]   Doing doing the jobs that we were used to doing with this this next product
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:12.220]   Next step down on the on the line is taking away features that that we're being previously handled by this
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:16.300]   It's really is that we are all we are all devoted to
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.500]   $1500 laptops and
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:26.220]   The thing is a $1500 laptop was always overkill for at least half of what we needed it for and so that's why
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:33.100]   That's why cheaper laptops started coming out and that's why the iPad was so popular because we needed something lightweight
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.340]   that's why smartphones both
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:42.700]   Pre iphone and post iphone became a big deal because we didn't really we didn't really want to carry a laptop
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:46.140]   with us at all times and keep even if there's Wi-Fi everywhere
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:51.260]   We just want this couple of important features that is relevant to us in our pockets
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:56.140]   We want to have that have that working. So I don't I just don't think of it as a
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.580]   I definitely not an apple doctor and definitely not
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:05.740]   I suspect that it's it's a shit. It gets shakier and shakier the more you pick apart this analogy
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:11.500]   And also it's I mean it's always the the history of technology on all levels is
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:15.500]   Fascinating on every single level and running came up with a good point
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.220]   It's like there was a reason why we used to have village and tower clocks
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:25.900]   Because there needed to be a standard by which people knew what time it was when we didn't have there was a wonderful question that made me feel both
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.540]   delighted and completely old there was an
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.900]   There was a no-stupid on the no stupid questions
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:35.740]   Subreddit on reddit somebody who's clearly very young saying well
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:39.100]   How did people like know what time it really was before
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:45.260]   phones that could automatically say and Wi-Fi and it wasn't saying it wasn't saying he wasn't asking like what how
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.540]   How do people know what time it was it was like how did you set your clock?
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.180]   How did when you got it when you got a brand new clock and plugged it in?
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.860]   How did you know what time it really was instead of like guessing within five or ten minutes and there had to be this discussion of
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.260]   Yeah, that there was you could you use to be a call to
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:07.420]   Exactly you call a phone and that's the and when villages used to run off of here is there is a bell that sounds at a certain time
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:13.340]   A day whether it's in the church or in this sound of the tone right at the tone the time will be 1 p.m
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:21.420]   Yep, and then then then we suddenly had the locomotive and we needed a way to actually know what time it was a really critical timekeeping device
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:27.180]   That was portable sailing ships that needed to crack the problem of how do we keep accurate time?
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.340]   No matter where we are because that's the only way we're going to be able to navigate all these things that are
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.180]   It's not just gee. I really wish that clocks were more convenient
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:41.500]   It becomes no here's something that was enabled by a advent of technology that solves a problem that was all that always existed
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.500]   We just didn't know we
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:49.820]   It was it's it's always fun as a designer to do have your sketchbook of fantasy products
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:58.060]   Pieces of technology you develop if we only had the had the resources. It's wonderful when you get to the point where actually it turns out that
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:07.820]   The iPhone comes out and multi-touch displays become reliable and affordable and suddenly you're going back to those sketchbooks you you filled in design school
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:12.620]   But what what a phone look like if we didn't have to have any physical buttons on it
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.620]   And what could that phone do if it like well, there you go
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:24.060]   Now we got there's an argument though that like I think for you know for a while microsoft had that problem where they were so
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:30.140]   Especially in the bomber years they were sold beholden to windows that they would kill anything innovative in the company that challenged it
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.620]   Like they would never scale windows phone up. They would never allow them to do things like the courier
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:41.100]   Just so many things died an apple institutionally figured out a way around that problem around those little petty five-dems
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:45.020]   But that's the risk of having that you got to defend against the other guy
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:49.260]   You're starting to pit come you know product lines against each other a little bit, right?
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:56.060]   Uh, you have to watch it. They're having to cannibalize. Yeah, they're internal cannibalization is fine and some companies don't like that either
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:03.340]   Yeah, I mean and perhaps it's upsetting because there are people who say you know the i the maggotage is becoming too much like the ipad
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:10.780]   And uh, well the iphone killed the ipod. You better the iphone than something else. Well, I don't mind no one's complaining that the ipod was killed by the
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.340]   Well probably tony fidel
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.060]   Seems
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.540]   Uh, but though like rene's point is true though
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:24.140]   Nobody right now nobody's complaining about the iphone killing the ipod because
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.100]   We have the iphone, but what if it was another?
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:33.580]   Music thing that killed the ipod that wasn't owned by apple then they would be oh no
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:39.100]   So the fact that the iphone killed the iphone better better we kill our own. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:42.860]   And letting tony's ipod department killed the iphone before it ever came out
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:46.220]   He also uh cybart quotes a tim cook
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:48.940]   Who said uh in 2019?
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:53.420]   I believe if you zoom out into the future and you look back and you ask the question
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.060]   What was apple's greatest contribution to mankind?
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.220]   It will be about health
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:04.860]   And uh, this is where the apple watch seems to really be getting uh some gear, you know getting a distraction
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:07.900]   Uh, uh health is obviously
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:12.700]   And despite the problems with the blood oxygen and all that stuff, it's still
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:15.980]   The pretty much the most amazing health device
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:20.620]   Yeah, out there right. I mean, I haven't tried to fit bit in a while, but
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.260]   And I know people love their fit bits
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.420]   It's it's the most comprehensive
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.820]   Best
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:34.060]   Wear a health wearable it's it's not that individually it has more sensors or works better
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:40.140]   But the the combination of all the things that it has combined with the software that lets you
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:45.100]   Understand and and share that information with your doctors. That's what makes it
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.580]   The most important
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:53.260]   contribution to society. I think is that it helps us understand our health you can participate in
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:59.740]   Studies that are based around the the sensors that are in the apple watch so you can join
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:05.740]   Um studies where you can track your blood oxygen you answer these questions
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:10.380]   These are all part of things that will inevitably in the future help
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:18.620]   Help doctors and scientists better understand our bodies in order to provide the right kind of care and treatments for us
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:25.260]   So this is all all of this is all part of what apple watch is doing. So I hands down 100% agree
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:31.340]   Again, another reason why I think apple watch needs to be platform agnostic. I don't mean family setup
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:37.260]   I mean an android user all by themselves can go by an apple watch and use it and it works really well
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:43.980]   And there's a health app for android. I want all of that because I think everybody should have the opportunity to be able to have that kind of technology
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.460]   I think apple's point of view as well if that's so so important then and red where should be better
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.380]   That you know, like you guys need to do a better job if you want to
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.940]   I think they just can't make it independent yet
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.140]   Like eventually they want it to be like an iphone where you don't have to have any other device
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:02.860]   Like the iphone used to be tethered to itunes and you had to have a mac or pc to use your iphone
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.380]   And then it got
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:08.060]   Technologically sound enough that they could untether it and now you just can buy an iphone
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:11.100]   And I think step-by-step year over year. We're getting there
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.020]   It's just it's a way more constrained device
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.780]   But in a year or two, I fully expect they'll have an apple watch of that and say in this year
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:22.300]   The apple watch is fully independent can stand on it. So you want an apple watch go buy an apple
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.420]   And that's a good thing for apple why because they would sell more watches
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:30.140]   I don't know. I don't care whether it's good for apple. I think it's good for human apple cares
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.340]   I know I agree with you
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:35.740]   Comes a platform though like once once you build up the device the device sells other things like you'll
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:41.020]   Maybe you won't buy an iphone, but you'll buy air pods and you'll subscribe to apple music and whatever their podcast service
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.740]   It's a private. Yeah. Yeah
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.820]   So in a way, that's why apple's itunes was
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:52.940]   You know the info on windows in the veg of course it works best with an iphone and with a mac
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.940]   Right, right. You know, it suits another game
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:27:01.260]   Renee's right is like apple devices contend to be the gateway device for people getting
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:07.020]   More and more into the apple ecosystem now. It's either you tried it. You don't like it
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.820]   You go back to android that and that's fine or
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:12.620]   For a lot of people it's also
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:18.220]   Oh, wow. Here's this new world that's opened up for me now. Everything I own is going to be apple like I think they're there
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:22.780]   There's not a lot of in between with that there. It's usually either I tried it
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:28.220]   I don't like it or I tried it and now I want all of the apple devices. So, you know apple wins
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.820]   That's a good point. That's with things like that. So yeah
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:37.260]   With an apple watch it wouldn't take them too long before they say and why am I using this crappy android phone
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:43.260]   When I could have a wonderful I would get these extra benefits like I'd have the health out that really thinks way better
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.660]   You're right. It's a wedge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:52.700]   Also, I think I think it should be a point of pride for apple because when I if I did if I dained myself to be like the
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.940]   Holy judge magistrate who is observing all companies and and giving them scores
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.460]   Feeling after scorecards about how good a job they're all doing
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:05.260]   It's it's really great that they make an apple watch that works great with the iphone
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:09.820]   It's at a lower level of difficulty to say that i'm going to make an apple watch that
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:16.140]   Doesn't require that we've got to tear that into all kinds of other technologies that we can control and operate
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.660]   It's like
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.580]   Is the difference between being a really good surfer at a wave pool and saying okay
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:26.780]   We're going to drive you out to an actual ocean where you have to deal with whatever you're going to be prepared for whatever
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:30.220]   Gets thrown at you. Let's see how well you serve then pink boy
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.060]   and
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:39.740]   And so that's that's that's one area in which again if I if as the intellectual discussion of how great and how
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:44.860]   How capable are these companies? I like to see the ability to say we don't care
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.500]   What you're using google docs on it will work really great on any platform
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.980]   And that really makes life totally suck for us on the google apps development team
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:57.820]   But that's that's part of what our business plan is is is key to pawn
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:02.620]   I'm really glad my mom uses an iphone because I did she she forgot her apple watch yesterday
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:07.020]   She is so excited and she said I promise I will always wear it
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:12.700]   Uh because I was worried about her falling and for fall detection alone
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:18.620]   Yeah, I could see them selling a lot of these but you're right if she were an android phone user
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:23.500]   Um, then I would feel a little put out that I couldn't get this for her
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.900]   Would you have for her?
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.660]   Family setup is a step in the right direction
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:33.420]   I think it was a really good idea especially for people who take care of or just have older people in their family that they
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:36.220]   That they worry about I think that's a great step in the right direction
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:41.580]   I took a chance because I had it mailed directly to her instead of having it mailed to me setting it up for her
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:49.980]   And but I also you know, I'm gonna spend time with her on you know face time saying, okay, mom now no no no no mom
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.980]   No, no press no don't
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:55.740]   I don't know how hard that's gonna be I've never
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:59.580]   My mom took to it right away. She loves it because she wants
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:02.780]   She got the big phone and she didn't want to have to have it with her all the time
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:07.500]   So this lets her keep her phone on the table or in her bag and if one of us calls she can see who's calling
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.220]   She can go get her phone if she wants I think she's great love it
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.500]   And I think the out of the box experience is pretty clean, right?
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.940]   It'll just be a matter of me making sure fall detections turned on
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:21.340]   You know some of the health features are turned on which are not turned on by default like the heart rate monitor
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:24.700]   She's actually excited about the idea that when she takes a walk
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:28.540]   She'll have the heart rate monitor keeping an eye on her heart so it doesn't get too high
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:32.860]   I mean, if it's little things like that. I think that's gonna be a huge benefit to her
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.260]   And when fitness plus comes out
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:40.220]   I'll be sending her an apple tv because then she'll want to be doing the exercise
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:44.060]   I could see this snowballing and in fact, I'm gonna get her an iPhone 12
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.940]   She's still using an iPhone 6. She can't go to iOS 14
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:49.020]   So she's gonna need a new phone
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:53.260]   I want I want to both face something that lori said that their apple was not the first
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:59.580]   First fitness watch or smartwatch maker to put oxygen sensors on the device. They weren't the first with heart rate detection
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.460]   They weren't the first with a whole bunch of stuff, but that's irrelevant
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:07.900]   What they're the first and in many cases the only company to do is to make it useful important and relevant
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:15.420]   It's not just a feature on a bullet chart. It is here is here is a where they clearly have this very very serious
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:20.620]   Almost holy mandate that we're not just trying to sell gadget watches here
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:25.020]   They are gadget watches. We are we enjoy selling lots of them making lots of money from them
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.060]   But the poor there's no point in us
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:34.620]   Making these if they're not actually actively contributing to the health of the person who buys it
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:37.100]   So we don't we don't want them to suddenly use it as a
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:41.820]   Suddenly use it just as a wristwatch as a timepiece. We want them to
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:49.900]   Discover that oh it's giving me a conditional little incidental reports on my heart rate on my sleep rate on blood oxygen saturation
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:56.860]   And i'm alert the fact that i'm being exposed to these numbers every day is making me more aware and thoughtful about how my body is operating
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:04.460]   No other smartwatch does anything close to that and i i'm just so i think that i think that there'd be more competition
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:11.740]   If these other companies weren't so terrified of apple knowing that at the at the moment that they did they decide to make the
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:17.420]   These apple watch either multi platform or just operate completely independently of any other computer
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:24.060]   They're gonna they're gonna run the table. It's like how you compete with an apple watch on style durability battery life
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.780]   As a piece of jewelry as an actual health oriented
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:34.540]   functional watch in terms of support in terms of people seeing it on your wrist and
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:40.380]   The the people the people that you admire and and kind of want to emulate have these things on your wrist on their wrist
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:45.420]   Whether they're people you know or people that you you know see it the see at the at the at the met gala
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:51.340]   I don't think I wonder if it really is that level of terror terror that says as soon
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:56.220]   As soon as as soon as barns a noble decides to open a bookstore in my neighborhood
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:02.140]   We're closing down the bookstore because there is no way we are going to be able to compete with that prices those prices on those
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:04.540]   uh that that variety
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:07.020]   And I do have to say um
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:13.740]   I see more and more apple watches on the wrists of people who could afford rolexes and who would have had rolexes
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:21.740]   In the past. This is neil cyborg's point exactly is there's no credible competition. They're just they just ran the table
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.380]   um
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:31.900]   Uh, let's see let's should we talk a little bit about apple tv plus because as you uh aptly pointed out
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:35.260]   Uh lori gill november first
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:38.460]   Three weeks away. I will be canceling
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.300]   plus
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.540]   you're gonna cancel it no because
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:46.780]   They just announced a new bruce springsteen documentary screaming
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:51.420]   tigidi dang it and apparently I think go ahead
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.740]   I think
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:34:00.220]   We're not giving tv plus the credit that it deserves because it's not just the tv shows which I think
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:04.300]   Most of them have really kind of fallen short of what we think are good
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:09.660]   But they have documentaries and um exclusive movies and it is growing it
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:12.860]   It is making a difference and in what
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:22.140]   What we want to see it's yes, it's still not you know the the full streaming service that you might get from hulu or netflix or something
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:26.140]   Like that but it's only five dollars a month and I think it really is growing the
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:30.860]   Amount of content that you can get from tv plus is getting a lot better
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:33.260]   Yeah
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:38.860]   Well, i'll be watching letter to you bruce springsteen's uh documentary over and over and over obsessively
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:43.500]   And then uh, I guess I didn't realize this but they had almost completed season two
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:49.020]   Of the morning show, which didn't really grab me although they had a very good concluding episode
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.700]   And they just had a couple more to shoot and so they have decided
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:58.860]   Uh to go ahead and film the last two episodes and complete it starting october 19th
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:04.060]   Once they finish it, uh, they can I suspect will be released early next year
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:09.420]   So they'll probably be able to release the other episodes early. That's a good point. That's right
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:12.540]   Yeah, if they've got most of it done they could release a lot of it
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:16.060]   And if they're just recording or just filming the last two episodes they
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:18.380]   They could probably have those cut and edit it
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:24.940]   They had the first two episodes almost completed when covid hit so they have uh, they have the rest of the seagull
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:29.100]   How many it wasn't that long six more episodes six episodes or eight total. I think yeah
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:34.620]   so uh, they they they rewrote the remaining episodes to
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.740]   Get covid into it
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:41.580]   Deadline has a story. What am I the only one that doesn't want
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:47.340]   Covid in my stories? I want to I want to forget about that when i'm watching shows
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:49.740]   I don't want it to be like mixed in with it
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:53.820]   And I know like that's that's just not realistic. This is the way the world is right now
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:36:00.140]   But I don't want you to address covid in your tv shows. I just want to forget about it
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:06.060]   Although remember that's that when the morning show before it came out they rewrote a lot of it to
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.620]   add the me to
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.340]   Movement to it. So maybe that's what they're saying. Well, that's what we do
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:15.340]   Uh in the morning, it's sort of like the newsroom when they started pulling
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:22.780]   Yeah, into it. Yeah, you're right. I'm a little bit behind watching last week tonight because john alver is incredibly funny
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:28.460]   But I sometimes I know a couple weeks. I'm not in the mood to be told about how totally screwed
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:34.300]   We are by by this creep court pick. Yeah, I don't I don't murder horn. It's handy
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.060]   No, and I love
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.780]   Look that turned out to be not really not really a real thing. Yay. I ignored it and it worked out. Okay
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:49.420]   And john alvers turned out to be more homework than they then entertainment because yeah, it's like I know I need to know all this stuff
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:55.660]   I don't know. I don't know if I want apparently apple tv is has purchased a new musical comedy series
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:57.660]   Which will be aired next year
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:01.020]   About a couple that gets lost in a magical town
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:04.380]   That acts like they're in a 1940s musical
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.140]   I love the cast kegan michael key
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:13.580]   Alan coming fred armisen and christen china with if you're going to do a musical
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.020]   That's a good bunch to have in there. Yeah. Yeah
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:23.180]   Was initially called the code name of it and you'll get this and he was schmigga dune
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:32.780]   But uh, they've uh, they've changed uh, apparently there's a new they're not going to use that. Although I wish they would
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:37.180]   um, so uh kegan michael key and
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:43.420]   Uh an actress named uh, sesally strong. Oh, she's regular on
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:49.020]   All right. Yeah, we'll we'll be on a backpacking trip designed to reinfigurate their relationship
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:55.420]   Which like pregadoon they discover a magical town in which everyone acts as if they're in a musical from the 40s
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:58.780]   And then they discover they can't leave until they find true love
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.620]   It's kind of like ted lasso meets pregadoon, I guess
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:05.900]   Um, I'll watch it. I'll watch it
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:11.660]   I will I guess that's that is that is such a strong like bench. They've got there. Yeah, okay
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:17.020]   We got alan comings and christen china with we're not talking about people who oh we dabble
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:21.580]   I took some I took I've always been a singer and I've always I took singing lessons when I was in college
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:23.580]   This is you're in high school if you were
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.140]   Yeah, these so commies is the mayor of the town
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:34.540]   Fred armisen is married to christen china with he's a minister and christen china with I know is his morally superior wife
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:37.580]   Um, it sounds really good
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:39.820]   And you know, I think it kind of comes from this notion
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:46.860]   Probably because of glee and then lala land the people are ready for for tv shows where people burst
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.260]   Cop rock didn't really get that
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.740]   Nothing started
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:56.220]   Dr. Horrible. Dr. Horrible was cool. Yeah, and I think glee really had a
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.900]   Strong falling the all the all the all musical
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.620]   episode of scrubs that was written by
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.420]   Of oscar and tony winning
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:13.260]   Well and an apple tv zone central park, right? So yeah, maybe there is a there is a market for it
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.700]   I wish they'd probably make it do I think that's a good name
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:24.380]   Well, this is this is this is why streaming services are wonderful because they don't necessarily it's on a network. It would be okay
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:30.220]   First it's not the number one in a slot after three episodes. I don't care that we've filmed 22
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:31.900]   We're canceling it. You know, we're gonna see it again
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:35.820]   It's like if the worst thing that could happen is that it doesn't get renewed for another season
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.620]   But we get a full season and it's there available forever
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:43.020]   It's like like one day at a time. That was one of the best one the greatest reboots
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.140]   I've ever seen it by one of those because I have a
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.940]   me and bonnie franklin, you know
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.340]   team
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.340]   team bonnie franklin, but
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:40:01.900]   I did enjoy the show so it's worth watching the remake. Oh, I I have to say it's one of the best
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:08.300]   Every every positive thing that you could possibly say about a norm and leer style sitcom
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:16.060]   Is absolutely true here where the acting is great the scripts are the the dialogue is is is crisp and wonderful
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:19.340]   When yes, it is it does get kind of heavy
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.580]   Because they do want to talk about issues
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:27.500]   But the great thing is is that they don't do it in the format of like a very special episode in which we talk about
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.340]   We talk about racism in america. It's like no
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:36.380]   These people are not white people and they deal with racism as an ongoing concern
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:43.100]   Throughout their entire lives in this country. There was a one of the best of the one of the favorite episodes is
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.500]   the
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.340]   In the first season
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:54.380]   One of the sort of building storylines is that the mother does not know that her teenage daughter is I don't know if she's
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.380]   lesbian or bi
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.700]   But she's not she's not heterosexual
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:03.260]   And so they're building the she's really kind of terrified about the kinesan era
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.820]   I can't pronounce it, but this the 16th birthday
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:11.740]   New year a celebration is right because of course like she and her grandmother read a morinna as the grandmother as the most
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:17.900]   Broadway read a morinna you've ever seen in her life wants to but wants to make her like this huge wonderful dress
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:24.140]   Because you know this is my responsibility as a grandmother that if if I make you the dress and you see it and you don't burst into tears
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:26.380]   I have failed and I have to start all over again
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:35.180]   And the the reveal episode was done in such a way where like it's such a beautiful thing because she wanted to like take her partner with her
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:39.100]   To the party and not like and that's there's no way around it
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:44.620]   And the the payoff for all this was that the grandmother who stereotypically, but oh my god
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:48.460]   I can't I can't deal with this. It's like she gets she gives her the first dress
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:51.180]   Didn't I did not get the reaction that she wants like I have failed
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.380]   I'm gonna start all over again and then like the end of the episode like she
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:42:00.780]   They she opens up like the second dress that the grandmother made and it's this beautiful tailored like armani
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:08.700]   Suit that's more like in like in lining with like what her tastes are and she bursts into tears for a million reasons like oh my god
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:11.900]   I'm sorry. I'm babbling, but that's how that's how much I enjoyed that series
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:18.620]   It was just so well done on every level and it's the sort of thing where it probably would not have it needed to have full at full seasons
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:23.660]   Prepared definitely gonna be there. You're definitely gonna be streaming and have had it been
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:31.420]   Prepared for CBS or NBC. We would have not seen anything apart. Yeah, it's kind of interesting how online has changed television
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:33.420]   dramatically
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.420]   um, somebody in the chat room mentioned another
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:39.100]   musical tv show zoey's extraordinary playlist
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:45.420]   Which was kind of a flop initially and then became a huge hit streaming and online
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:48.140]   And it was renewed because of that
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:57.820]   Um, and uh, so that's it's interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I think oh remember we're gonna see more variety in our tv programming. Thank goodness
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:04.700]   This i'll mention this because it's it's wonderful and also because it's totally aligned with what we're talking about hu lafman
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:09.020]   Hu jackman was in a series for the network uh for network called viva laflin
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:16.220]   Which was like on that same level where it was all it was all thought like a low right like casino district and in in laflin, navada
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:21.820]   But you have hu jackman wolverine but also like one of the best like broadway stars like
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:29.340]   You've signed up this you signed up this crew so that hu that the hu jackman will do like a broadway custom broadway number like once a week
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:32.700]   And you cancel it after like three episodes. What is wrong with you?
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:39.180]   At least at least we can bring this back here's a here's a little bit uh from you can uh turn up the sound
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:45.900]   Huge jackman doing sympathy for the devil
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.940]   Now this was 2007
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:54.780]   Now that i see this i say i want to see the rest
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:59.580]   I love you jackman
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.940]   So this is a musical
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:11.580]   It's it's not a full musical it was like a a drama an evening drama in which but they would do musical number nine people bursting in the song
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:14.780]   I kind of wish they would do it in real life, especially jim jackman forgot
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:20.220]   Yeah, he's a great performer. Wow. So that just tanked. They did one season
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:23.100]   That's two episodes five unaired
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.260]   Yeah, that's sad
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:29.180]   It exists. There are probably more huge acumen musical numbers out there
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:36.780]   That are just like like the like the arc of the coverment covenant like nailed inside a crate and in some warehouse where we'll never be seen again
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:39.260]   That's just shameful
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:43.980]   Wow, let's uh, let's take a tiny teeny weenie
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:52.540]   Uh break a little timeout and uh continue on with the show with your picks of the week boy and girl
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:55.500]   time for picks
[01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:59.500]   And i'm gonna go with lorry because i already have it
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:06.140]   So we have good taste in blood oximeters. Yes, we do
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:10.700]   So yeah, uh when um the series six came out
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:18.460]   Um, of course i'm reviewing i've reviewed the series six and one, you know, obviously you want to review the um blood oxygen monitor
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.460]   I just did it. I'm 99 percent
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.380]   99 percent
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.380]   You're good. I hope it's accurate
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:31.740]   Well, so the so i had to go buy an fda approved blood oximeter so that i couldn't make the comparison because there were
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:38.860]   Some people in the world who made these really ridiculous claims that it's not accurate and it's worthless and pointless
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:45.420]   Which i completely disagree with so i bought an fda approved one to find out the differences between the two and
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:51.660]   Yes, it's less accurate than the blood oximeter that i bought that's finger that you put on your finger
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:53.260]   But
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:57.420]   It's only during circumstances under which i'm moving around a whole bunch
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:05.420]   A finger a fingertip blood oximeter works even when you've you've been exercising or you're currently exercising like that's where it wins
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:10.460]   But you also don't wear it while you sleep all night long and it doesn't track your blood oxygen while you sleep
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:17.420]   So i'm just saying but here we go. So, um, if you want to get yourself a blood um blood oxygen monitor
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:21.180]   Um, the peak life 360 is an fda approved
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:24.540]   Pulse oximeter blood oxygen monitor
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:32.060]   Um, and it's relatively inexpensive and it works really great it checks your pulse and it checks your blood oxygen level
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.860]   It works in just a few seconds. I think maybe
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:40.700]   Five seconds is is about what it is you can walk around with it right on your finger if you want
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:43.740]   You know, it's it's real easy to use it simple
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:46.700]   You don't do anything you literally like you press the little
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:51.740]   Icon the first time just to turn it on and then every time after that it just
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:56.940]   It just happens it just does it on it on its own and it starts to track your stuff. So, um
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:02.300]   Like yeah right now. It's taking a couple of the apple watch pretty closely. I'm curious
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:08.620]   Yeah, so they were always off a couple of degree a couple of percentage points
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:14.540]   So one might be 98 while one was 99 one might be 100 while the other was 97
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:21.580]   But they were always within a four point range and I haven't spoken to any doctors to find out how relevant a 4%
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:24.300]   changes, but I would say
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:31.020]   That's pretty much as as close to accurate on both sides as you can get this fda approved
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:36.460]   Blood oxygen m- oxygen monitor versus apples non fda approved blood oxygen monitor
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:39.260]   They were always within four points of each other. Okay
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.460]   And the only time that that there was any kind of discrepancy
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:49.980]   Was when I I was in the middle of exercising and I would stop exercising specifically so that I could try it on my apple watch
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.980]   And it just wouldn't work. It just wouldn't read it
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:56.060]   And I think that has to do with like the fact that you had been moving around a whole bunch
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.780]   So I was doing pilates the other day and I thought well
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:05.100]   I wonder if I have better oxygen saturation or worse when I'm exercising and I was pleased to see it was 99
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.740]   So I guess because you're huffing and puffing
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.260]   And especially with pilates where it's all about breathing
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:15.980]   Um, yeah, maybe maybe that was your when you exercise. Oh, you didn't get a reading
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:17.020]   That's right
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:22.460]   Not on my watch, but I did on my on my on the on the the peak through peak life 360
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:25.900]   And it was always at a high percentage was always good. Yeah, yeah
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:32.620]   Very interesting. Yeah, if so I did buy a blood oximeter, you know an fda approved one
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:36.700]   Early on during the covid crisis because I
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:42.380]   Had been told and I think it's still the case that when your blood oxygen drops precipitously
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:44.300]   That's the time to rush to the hospital
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:48.540]   In fact, that's what happened with the president when he got down to 93 percent, which
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:52.060]   I kind of seem didn't seem like it was that low, but he was down at 93
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:55.500]   I guess in a as they keep using this phrase abundance of caution
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:00.940]   Uh, they started giving him oxygen. So, uh, you know clearly you want to pay attention to that
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.220]   especially
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.740]   if you if you're
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:09.340]   Diagnosed with covid because then you want to you know, you could stay at home and and get better at home
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:14.140]   But if your blood oxygen drops, you really want to keep an eye on that because that's when you want to seek
[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:17.260]   Assistance, so I bought that proactively
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:21.820]   But it's nice to have it on the watch. I yeah worries me though four points is a lot
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:25.100]   Um, and that could you know if you were 93
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:30.220]   Uh and needing medical versus 97 and not
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:36.620]   But the the the I think the thing to keep in mind and I don't know a lot about the signs behind it
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:43.980]   But I I tried to research as much as I possibly could so that I can be as like accurate with my understanding of it as I could be
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:48.140]   so, um, even a fingertip blood oxygen monitor is gonna have
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.700]   It's not going to be 100 accurate
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:55.100]   Just because of things in the world. So nail polish could affect it
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:50:01.260]   The ambient lighting in the room could affect it your movement could affect it. So I think four four percent
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:08.380]   because like sometimes the the apple watch was showing, you know 100 while the
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:14.380]   The fd approved finger one was showing 97 and sometimes it was the exact reverse
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.860]   So I think that like if you consider
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:23.500]   All of the things that could negatively affect an accurate reading. I think 4% is really good between them and
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.460]   One time having
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.460]   Something drop a little bit
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:33.420]   Is I don't think anything to be concerned with it's when you test it multiple times
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:37.820]   And you see that your blood oxygen level has gone down and it stays down
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:41.980]   So if it goes down to 90 and it stays at 90 or 93 or something like that
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:46.780]   That's when you know that there's a problem and that you need to go see your doctor. Yes. Yes. Yes
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.580]   Uh a useful thing to have
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:53.020]   And I think maybe if you're worried or you're some a six and sick in your family
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:58.700]   Probably good to have an FDA approved blood oximeter. Yeah, and it's that that was not very expensive
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:03.020]   Yeah, well, I got mine. I think there was a lot of scalping going on because it was a lot more expensive
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:06.540]   Yeah, yeah, that's a little frustrating
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:09.020]   Andy and I go pick of the week
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:15.020]   Just quickly I'm gonna underscore how valuable having a real FDA approved oximeter is
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:19.340]   For for me the the reason why I bought one early in the pandemic was
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:23.260]   after the first reports from people who had like
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:31.500]   Overcome it. I was as well as possible to overcome it saying that this is this is like nothing. No other like no flu
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.740]   It's like nothing. I've ever gotten I've had such pain and such like disorientation
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:42.540]   That I realized that the it was going to be important to figure out the difference if I got sick to figure out the difference between
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:48.460]   Uh, I'm really really scared that I should go to the hospital right now because I actually am having a
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.420]   Price a health crisis or it's just that
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:58.220]   This is the the covet symptoms are so intense that I've never I've never felt them before and I'm feeling very very scared
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:04.860]   And the aximital is like, okay, you put this on your fingers like well, you're still you're still at 98 percent and your oxygen level has always been 98
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:06.460]   It's not declining
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:12.940]   So you probably need to ride this out and not not a expose yourself to more illness at the hospital and also
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:17.820]   Take more resources away from an already very very overstrapped medical community
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:24.540]   So I want to that's that's such a great recommendation. I want to underscore that. I have two and two recommendations
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:32.060]   Uh, since we're talking about tv shows that turn into musicals. I have to recommend like the season three episode of documentary now
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:38.460]   Uh available on netflix. It's that series that that is like fake documentaries that are usually inspired by real ones
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:42.620]   So in season three they did a documentary a fake mockumentary called co-op
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:47.580]   Which is a parody of this super super famous documentary about the recording of the cast
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:52.380]   album for uh, steven sondheim's company like back in 1972 1973
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:54.300]   So they wrote a brand new muse
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:59.180]   So it's the recording of this cast album. Of course they had to write brand new songs
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:06.780]   They're not they're not song lyric parodies. They're like you can sort of see where maybe they got influence from this musical here this musical there
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:12.300]   brilliantly done and post partly because they got these amazing performers
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:16.620]   Uh, they got uh john malani is like the is like the steven sondheim guy
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:21.500]   But they got richard richard richard kind who i didn't know before actually
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:28.700]   Uh originated a character in the sondheim musical uh rene alise goldberg who was uh gold berry who was uh, uh, who
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:30.780]   cast a hamilton
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:33.340]   Alex brightman who was the original cast of
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:36.140]   Of of school a rock
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:39.740]   Uh, paula pelle who i knew as a comedy writer she you can see you're like in the video right now
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:44.540]   She's playing like the array the elaine stritsch scene where she's the she's like the the
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:49.020]   sauce and saucy veteran like performer who's great
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.740]   Who's who's who's a brilliant performer?
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:57.500]   But she just is not getting the song right and she knows she's frustrated by that she knows she's not getting it
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.820]   And her voice is amazing and I just loved it from start to finish
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:06.380]   It was just so beautifully done. Uh, like I said you can get it not only can you get it on netflix
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.940]   But you can also buy the cast album that they recorded
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:14.060]   On uh on uh any streaming service. So it's really really great stuff
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:18.860]   Uh, my original pick of the week was actually to understood link to an underscore
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.820]   An article that just appeared on cnn.com
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:27.820]   Uh to the other day, which is a very comprehensive list of here is uh, here are links for every single state
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:31.500]   To get to the page for uh mail-in ballot tracking
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:37.180]   So after you mail in your ballot, it will tell you what but it's it really is like an amazon delivery where it will show you at
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:43.260]   At every stage like it's been it's been put into the mail system. It's been accepted by the balloting
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:50.860]   Site, but it hasn't been processed yet. It's been opened and processed and now you're and finally your your vote has been processed and counted
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:53.180]   So it's really really important number one to
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.460]   To make sure that you know that your vote was counted number one
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:01.340]   But also I think the articles like this and resources like this are important because they
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:03.820]   Absolutely put to bed
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:08.300]   Any argument about oh, well, there's so much room for fraud and mail-in balloting
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:13.020]   We're going to see people voting two three four times and ballots that get thrown out and stuff like that
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:15.580]   That's it's nonsense
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.700]   I think most people listening to the show know that mail-in ballot
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:23.100]   Balloting has been done for decades without widespread fraud
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:29.100]   But also if you need to convince yourself or help other people to understand that this is not
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.580]   This is a very very secure form of voting
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:35.980]   It's been done for so long that it's not something they're just trying off the top of their heads
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:40.380]   And that your ballot gets tracked at every single point of a point of
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:46.780]   Processing not only to make sure that if you voted that your vote was processed and vote and accurately tallied
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.180]   But also that it's not going to be possible for you to vote twice or three times or four times
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:56.060]   Uh, so very very the link is in the show notes really really important stuff
[01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:59.900]   Again, not only for yourself, but also to help other people feel
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:06.860]   Make sure that they maintain confidence in a voting system that they should feel every confidence and despite other individuals who
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:12.060]   Have it in their personal best interest to make you think that it's a vector for fraud. Yes
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:16.380]   It's kind of if you think you might lose kind of a good
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:20.380]   Preliminary plan to just cast doubt in the whole process
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:22.940]   Yeah, uh, unfortunately
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:28.860]   Uh, especially I did I did see last week tonight this week and he made a very very one of the most important points
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:33.820]   He made was that every single election an election day result is not a result
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:38.300]   It's simply a prediction of a result because we're always in any normal election
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:42.140]   It takes days or weeks for final tallies to actually be counted
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:49.660]   And so the one of the one of the things that cut me a weekly thing to get afraid of from from last week tonight is
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:56.620]   A projection that people don't accept is simply a projection to think oh well gee if if this candidate was declared the winner in
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:58.700]   Pennsylvania, but no then a month later
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:04.060]   Oh suddenly they found all these magical ballots that mean that my candidate lost in Pennsylvania
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:10.140]   I think we say that's why I don't trust this election. That's why we need to get these militias in place like oh god
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.860]   It's gonna happen. Isn't it? It's gonna happen. Isn't it?
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:14.860]   Is a terrifying
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.860]   Thought rene richy
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.020]   your pick of the week
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:25.180]   So I chose something that would bring just a little bit of fun back into our lives because like I said with baby yoda and an apple event
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:28.940]   I'm collecting I'm collecting what I can for us to hold on to in these dark times
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:31.980]   And this is if you're not familiar with can casienda
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:34.860]   He is a alcala me legendary developer
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:39.740]   He had a bunch of accomplishments before he was the third person drafted to the safari team
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:44.940]   At apple before it was called safari back in the alexander days with don melton and you know
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:50.620]   I think he was the second person actually right after don and he helped create web kit and safari
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.900]   He created the iphone keyboard the original iphone keyboard
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:57.100]   He created my favorite apple watch faces the solar face
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:58.300]   He's just
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:04.060]   legendary career and he left apple a few years ago and he's done his first india app and it's called up spell
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:06.940]   and it's just a casual casual little game where
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:10.940]   You're giving a bunch of letters and you have to try to make a word out of them
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:14.700]   And the faster and better word you can make out of them the more points you score
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:19.260]   And he even you know sent me a snide message going look how I youtube
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:21.900]   You know, he got himself a thumbnail and he got himself
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:24.700]   You know a youtube account and he put up a video
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:28.620]   Where he's just you know having a super amount of fun
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:31.820]   There's can right there, you know just a super amount of fun
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:37.020]   Making this app and and sending it out and if you go through his twitter account
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:41.180]   There's just so many good causes that he's involved with going along with this
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:46.220]   That it's not just you know a fun app, but it's uh, it's not just good
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:47.580]   It does good
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:52.300]   And I was I was really happy to see I can always use some you know something fun on my iphone to
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:56.140]   Take me away from doom scrolling twitter or or things like that
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:59.980]   Yeah, any predictions from anybody when we're going to see big sir
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:05.740]   It won't be next version in tell her or or apple final release version
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:09.340]   Not a baby. Well, I guess i'll probably soon really
[01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:14.300]   Well, I think rinde was pointing out to us that um
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:17.500]   That like that it might come
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:21.340]   The intelligent version might come first and then the
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:28.700]   Apple silicon version in other words, should we would it be next months when and they talk about a new apple silicon mac
[01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:33.180]   And will it have a lot of interesting features to demo their exclusive to apple like we already know
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:38.700]   It's got a whole different recovery system and a whole different secure boot system and whether they're going to demo anything else
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:41.420]   Like they'll probably demo iphone and ipad games on it
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:45.340]   You know, there's a bunch of interesting things they could do with big sir for apple silicon
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:48.380]   So I am doing as you know, I do a show called hands-on mac
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:52.380]   It's just a short little thing comes out on fridays with tips for mac users
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:57.500]   And uh, i'm doing the road to big sir, you know what i'm doing to prepare for big sir
[01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:02.060]   But it's like, you know, we record a couple of weeks ahead so i'm trying to figure out
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:10.780]   I want to make the last piece installing it anyway the the the second to last i think unless they delay big sir even longer
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:17.740]   Uh featured this app and I thought i'd share this with you because i'd never heard of it rinde you probably have because it's it's a franco phone
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.980]   app called etra check comes out of uh ontario
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.900]   and
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:30.060]   It's uh, you can use it for etra, which means to be so it's i don't know what that means to be checked
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:37.020]   I guess i don't know but the idea there are some issues you remember katalina deprecated 32 bid apps
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:38.780]   You can't use them anymore
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:43.340]   So that you can look at that under the apple menu you can look and see a little bit of that
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:48.460]   But this does a much better job telling you what apps will be incompatible and we know that
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:54.940]   kernel extensions are going to be changed dramatically in big sir and that's one of the things I want to prepare for is make sure
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:01:02.620]   That I know which apps use incompatible kernel extensions you're starting to see those pop-ups on katalina legacy system extension
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:05.180]   And that's what we're a little
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:09.260]   Preparing for so this is a really handy program free to use
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:12.860]   19 if you want the pro or 18 dollars without the pro
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:19.580]   Features which you may or may not need it has some automatic repair features that the
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:26.780]   Unpaid version doesn't have but I think for figuring out your compatibility potential compatibility issues ahead of time
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:30.860]   Etra check is great now. I should point out that is in the app store
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:35.820]   But that's a limited version as always with the app store the developer couldn't do as much
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:39.660]   So there's also a download from the website which is e t re
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:42.300]   Check cagck.com
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:48.060]   And I found it really a useful tool. I'm glad I paid for it. I'm gonna keep it around
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:54.620]   It has a lot of the 32 bit thing was like being run over by a zomboni because they gave them 10 years
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:58.300]   And everyone's like that's a zomboni. It's never gonna get here. I'm gonna put a little table
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:01.340]   I'm gonna drink some tea. I'll get around it. Oh, look I was
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:09.500]   It's you right 15 dollars in the app store 18 dollars if you get it directly, but there are more features obviously in the
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:14.780]   Version you get from the the website. It's kind of I don't know if you any of you ever used it
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:16.780]   I'd never heard of it even
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:22.620]   And I found it in my research for this hands-on Mac and I actually think it's kind of a useful thing to to have around
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:26.140]   Guess nobody's used it before it was new to you too
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:28.540]   Um
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:34.700]   That's it for this edition of Mac break weekly catch Renee Richie on his youtube channel youtube.com/
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.780]   Renee Richie
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:43.660]   He's at Renee Richie on the twitter writes for iMore and others. In fact, you had that piece yesterday on iMore about what you fantasize
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:48.060]   Renee's fever dream about next time the best boss ever at iMore
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:54.940]   That might be this woman here lori Gill. She's the managing editor at iMore at apoholic on
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:58.060]   Twitter anything you want to plug lori coming up
[02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:02.860]   Just pay attention to us next Tuesday on iMore we're gonna have all the events stuff
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:10.380]   Yeah, as as are we as I mentioned we're gonna be mica and I'll be doing the live stream commenting thing
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:13.020]   10 a.m. Next Tuesday and then
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:17.420]   We'll assemble this team if you're all available unless Renee runs off to a briefing or something
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:20.220]   Which he's been I have zero control. Yeah, I know
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:25.740]   Zero control if he can we'll be here if he if he can't he won't but we will talk about it at what apple and apple
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:31.340]   It's gonna be a hard day, you know, because it's also prime day and I just watch the faces of every former big media person
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:34.140]   I know say what a minute iPhone day is the same day as prime day
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:39.980]   Because that's usually a 24-hour thing like they give 24-hour coverage they cover every deal
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:44.380]   Yeah, like it's that's one of the most brutal days in big media and now they have an iPhone to cover as well
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.700]   Privilege that I can ignore prime
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:51.260]   Me too. Don't tell lori please look like a killer staring at me already
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:58.860]   By the way, Renee and georgia dao's show is now out on youtube and it's awesome apple talk
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:06.940]   Thank you. Yeah, well done. You guys are great together. It's a nice team. Thank you and Andy and i co of course wgph in boston
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:09.020]   When you're gonna be on next?
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:13.020]   I'm off this week due to election coverage, but i'm back on next week
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:17.420]   So i'll have a good three and a half days probably to think about what i want to say
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:24.060]   About announcements probably friday if my usual slot is friday at one p.m at wgbh news.org
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:29.340]   I will also be freaking out on prime day, but only because I really want to buy a
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:34.380]   $1600 camera in 2021 and i would like to buy it using as few
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:36.860]   As few real dollars as possible
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:42.140]   So I will be keeping I will be paying attention to any non tech related items that are good
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:49.260]   Good things and an actual good deal both of which are very very low thin on the ground on prime day and recommending it on twitter with my
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:51.580]   with my
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:59.260]   It's a camera because exactly if I can again if if you needed some like some halloween string lights and you were to buy that
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:04.860]   No, actually actually what i'm getting at is that like if you were going to buy like a $5000 like electric motorcycle
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:07.980]   Which are available on amazon and you were just to say hey
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:11.420]   I don't want to buy these halloween string lights on that on on
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:13.020]   On Andy's feed
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:17.740]   But if I were to click on that link and then buy that $5000 electric motorcycle
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:24.140]   I will probably get like some amazon credits based on that purchase that will put me like a good $8 closer to my olympus
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:27.100]   omd em1 mark three. That's all i'm saying
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:32.860]   Ladies and gentlemen that concludes this edition of mac break weekly we do this show
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:37.100]   Right after ios today so you can have an all apple morning on a tuesday
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:42.540]   Ios today starts about nine. We start a couple hours later around 11 am pacific 2 pm eastern
[02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:50.220]   Time 1800 UTC the live streams are available at twitter.tv/live that's live audio and video
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.700]   For those of you who watch roku
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:59.100]   Yes, our app no longer works roku change the api and our app developer got a job. Oh my god. So
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:04.220]   So uh, we are working in a way that we you can subscribe to a twit
[02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:07.820]   Feed but it won't have the live stuff. So go to youtube
