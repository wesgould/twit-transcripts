[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.800]   It's that special time of the year
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.200]   when I send Renee and Andy and Alex home
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.400]   and I get to take over Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.800]   Really it's our editors in our audience who put this show together.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   It's our best of episode.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.000]   You know, this was actually a fun year.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   When I listen back to all these segments,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.200]   we had a lot of fun, a lot of interesting stories.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800]   And I think you're going to enjoy this best of thanks to Micah Sargent,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.000]   the producer of the show who put this together.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.400]   And I think early in the year was also Carsten who put this together.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.800]   We're going to start off with a little bit going way back to the beginning of the year.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.600]   David Pogue joins us, New York Times columnist.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.400]   He's famous for CBS Sunday morning and his work with Scientific American.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.200]   He back in 2007 was one of the three or four top journalists
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   who got iPhones before they were released.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   And you'll never believe what happened next.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   January 9th, so three days ago,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.600]   was the 13th anniversary not of the ship date,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.200]   but of the announcement that famous Steve Jobs speech.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.600]   Were you all there at Moscone Center when Steve announced the iPhone?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.200]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.600]   Yeah, I was there.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.800]   You got it back.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   It's the 13th anniversary of the shipping not the announcement.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   The shipping was in January.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Are you sure?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   On the way around.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   No, he announced the WWDC in January and it came out.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   No, he announced it at Mackerel in January.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Yeah, or Mackerel rather not WWDC.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   Right.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   Okay.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   I was sitting next to Scott Borne who was the guy who wanted an iPhone vest.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   He was so sure that there.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   No, we didn't know for sure there was going to be an iPhone.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   This is back when Apple really could lock this stuff down.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   So we had no idea.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   David, did you know you probably had an advanced preview?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   No, no.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.000]   I will share with you a story I've never told anyone that's really embarrassing and makes
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.800]   me look terrible though about that.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.400]   Apple gave four people the phone before, two weeks before it was available to the public.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.800]   So that was Wall Street Journal, Walt Mossberg, New York Times, me and Stephen Levy at Newsweek.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Headband from USA Today got to the floor.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   I remember this because I'm bidders to this day, 13 years later.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   I know you are.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   So bitter, so healthy.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   So it was so cool.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   I wasn't allowed to show anybody, but I could play with it.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   I could learn it.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.300]   And one of the first things I had since being issued the phone was a speaking engagement
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.800]   in Lake Como, Italy.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.200]   So I took a red eye with this thing in my pocket, landed, gotten a cab to the venue of the talk,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.800]   slumped down in the cab seat, fell asleep.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   Oh no.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Oh no.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   The phone slipped out of my pocket.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   Oh no.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   One of four existed in the world.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.880]   Did you, were you able to recover it?
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.280]   I got out.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.800]   I got my tour of the venue.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.560]   I met the organizers and then realized it and just got, you know, my heart dropped out
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.240]   of my body and she said it until you and well, of course, he's probably, you've probably
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.920]   got the receipt, right?
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   And I did see it.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   The phone number was on it.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.960]   Oh, right.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   We got it back.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.760]   And he was really mad when he came back to the place.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.600]   I emptied my wallet to him and like, please take this tip.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.440]   And but he was really infuriated.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.960]   He had no idea what it was.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.720]   That was some pager or something.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   So that's what it was like.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   I can't do it.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   As if I can do it.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   So close.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.560]   Any infuriated Italian we can all see.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.120]   Especially a infuriated Italian cabbie.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120]   Wow.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   Wow.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120]   Unfortunately, guess what?
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120]   It didn't exist back then.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.280]   So they couldn't sell it to anybody.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.560]   Yeah, this is prior to the, you know, many years prior to the iPhone four leak to Gizmodo.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.960]   That's right.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.880]   And actually all the R people who would be furious at me to know this story have now
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   moved on.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   Yeah, you're safe.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   So I can now be watching.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.920]   Oh my God.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   I believe I have the X ray from your sleep last night.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   There it is.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.360]   That's an air pod.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.240]   This is a guy.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   Only one.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.880]   It's interesting because it's very close to where Andy lives in Worcester.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.040]   He was to was to man swallows the air pod while sleeping and does not realize it.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   That headline is just so beautifully for it, especially the does not realize it part.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.280]   That's not really.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.120]   I've never I've never slept that deeply.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.960]   I'm very envious apart from the ingesting something that's both expensive and health
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.520]   and and like again, a battery that you probably should not be small.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.920]   This is from a town found there, the house cat.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.200]   This is from 22.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.480]   WLP.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.520]   You probably watched that Andrew in Worcester.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.440]   A Worcester man lucky to be breathing today after accidentally swallowing one of his
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.160]   air pods.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.320]   Bradford go to a good good French Canadian woke up Tuesday morning noticed he had a little
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.280]   trouble swallowing.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.920]   He attributed it to a dry or sore throat and carried on with his day.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.000]   The day before he had been shoveling snow for two hours after the nor Easter.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   You remember that, Andy.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   That was a nightmare.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.040]   I was wondering why Mattel was coming out of his mouth.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.600]   He says he went to sleep that night all worn out.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.120]   I went back in the morning and shoveled snow for an hour when I came in.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.800]   I tried to drink a glass of water again and couldn't says go to a at this point.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.960]   Go to a also noticed one of his air pods was missing.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.520]   His family began putting clues together.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.880]   By that point, my wife and son had gotten the idea.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.120]   I may have swallowed it.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.640]   They brought it up jokingly at first, but it seemed too coincidental that I would be
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.940]   missing it.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.760]   When I knew I went to bed with it while I felt a distinct blockage in the center of my chest.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.720]   He went to the emergency room and much to the doctor's surprise.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.680]   And X-ray showed his missing air pod lodged in his esophagus.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.040]   He didn't chew it enough.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.560]   You know, one shot.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.440]   This is a very common problem.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.000]   People do not chew their food sufficiently.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.600]   As a result, they gulp.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.440]   They gulp and things get lodged in your esophagus.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.120]   They did an emergency endoscopy to remove it.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.560]   Unknown whether the air pod continued to work after the endoscopy.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.920]   Is that covered under apple care?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   I don't know.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   Here it is.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   Here is the errant air pod.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.480]   We are getting worried about nothing.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.800]   It wasn't an air pod.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.400]   Pro is one of the first generation.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   No big deal.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.320]   I've probably swallowed many of those.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.000]   I don't know where they ended up.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   They're not anywhere.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.280]   The battery is probably going to dine it in a week anyway.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.760]   He said it never occurred to me that sleeping with headphones could be a safety hazard.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.000]   I was really quite lucky.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.760]   On Twitter thread from a developer, Costa Eletherio, who apparently he's had a number
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.560]   of successful apps, he says the app store has a big problem.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.920]   It happened to him.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.960]   You and honest developer working hard to improve your IAP conversions, your competitor, a
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.000]   two million dollar year scam running rampant.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.920]   Over the years, I've worked incredibly hard to create what I think is the best Apple Watch
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.560]   keyboard app in the world when I started.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.960]   I had two gold.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.520]   I believe I became the top paid app of 2020.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.120]   I failed to stay ahead of the competition, but not for reasons I anticipated.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.720]   He got copied.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.000]   First they made an app that appeared to fulfill the promise of a watch keyboard was practically
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.080]   unusable.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.320]   Then they started heavily advertising on Facebook and Instagram and using my own promo video
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.280]   of my own app with my actual name on it.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   You have to pay.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.680]   It's a 400 because you can't really use the app until you pay for it.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.880]   The ends up being $416 a year.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   It's so gross.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:18.560]   A year they keep getting five star reviews because Costa says they're fake.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.120]   He says it's obvious they're fake because the app doesn't work once you pay for it.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.000]   And all these people saying, "Oh, it's great.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.760]   I really like it."
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.560]   Fake ratings, fake reviews quickly push the scams to the top of the search results, leaving
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.320]   honest and hardworking developers in the dust.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.120]   He says, "It's not just me.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.000]   There are hundreds of these.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.320]   This happens all the time.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.280]   Why doesn't Apple fix this?
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.920]   How come Apple can't fix this?"
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   David Barnard has been beating the strum for years as well.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.920]   He did a great job over this week.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.840]   He's surfacing articles from Gruber from 2018 talking about the desperate need for a Bunko
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   squad on the App Store because there are so many scams.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.500]   They're even worse now than they used to be because they're taking advantage of something
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.640]   that shouldn't exist, which is weekly subscriptions.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.520]   There's very little need for any apps.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.720]   - Weekly is terrible.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.480]   - A weekly subscription.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.360]   Apple has made tiny bits of progress.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.120]   They've made it harder for you to be tricked into tapping the wrong thing to authorize them.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.360]   Little things like that, but just the amount of pure scam apps on the App Store, they seem
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.480]   to come in waves and surges.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.320]   I don't know what Apple is doing, but obviously it is not effective.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.040]   I don't know why this isn't a huge glowing neon priority because Apple's whole thing
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.200]   is faith in the App Store.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.560]   That's the whole promise of the App Store is that it is a safe, trusted place for you
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   to spend money, whether that's in-app purchases or direct payments for apps.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.800]   It totally destroys all of that good faith equity that they've built.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.000]   - Is that absolute?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.880]   - No, it's really terrible.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.520]   I feel so bad for cost.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.160]   Is that app still up?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   - There's so many of them.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.120]   Any time there was a popular game or something, it would get cloned and there'd be a scam
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   version of it.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.400]   In any category, there's all these scam apps that all they do is rope you into what looks
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   like a small...
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.160]   First of all, I don't know why people pay subscriptions for this stuff.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.080]   I will never victim blame, but this stuff is not worthy of your subscription money and
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.640]   then they try to obfuscate the fact that it's a weekly subscription.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.200]   I don't know who's falling for it, but there seems like, based on their sales, a massive
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.800]   amount of people falling for these things and it does become incumbent on the platform
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.600]   to protect us from ourselves at a certain point.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.120]   - Well, a scam app should never appear on the platform.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.480]   Even if they don't have the resources to police all of them, any of the apps in any
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.360]   of the top lists should be routinely scrutinized, like daily scrutinized because there's just
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.240]   not that many in the top lists.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.640]   So I should say that a week ago, Apple did in fact take it down.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:54.280]   All that Twitter activity brought that to their attention, but they didn't take down
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:00.320]   their developer account and they have another scam called GPS speedometer, which is also
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.400]   $200 a month.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.800]   And it's just crazy.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   - Gross.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   - $200,000 a month they're making it.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   I'm sorry, yeah.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.840]   It does feel like they've got enough data to track, to basically have a scam app like these
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.240]   trigger warnings that get escalated immediately to a human review that if you have some, if
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   you have an app that's a watch app particularly that's charging and a relatively enormous amount
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.640]   of money per week, that gets immediately checked out by your real life human being to see exactly
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.200]   what's going on there.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:44.400]   - Yeah, there's any company that is trying to sell thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.680]   of items in a store, they have a certain amount of cover here saying that look, we don't,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.520]   we have an automated system for submitting.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.120]   We can't simply human review every single app or else we will never be able to get people
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.280]   developers to get their stuff on the app store.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.960]   But nonetheless, when you have enough metrics to say this person, this person who's working
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.000]   at McDonald's and making $1 over minimum wage per hour seems to own a lot of boats for some
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   reason.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.160]   Perhaps we should find out if they've got their hands on anything else in the corporate structure.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.000]   This is the similar sort of thing I think.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.840]   - So a couple of proposals, one obvious one is to Marco Arment suggested just eliminate
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.080]   the weekly subscription billing option.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:37.840]   Dave Barnard posted, part of this is Apple's fault because they don't give you the information
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.640]   in a clear way to understand what you're paying for.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:52.200]   He suggests redesigning the buy sheet so that it's clear that it's 10 bucks a week and it's
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.560]   going to, you get a three day trial, it needs to be more clear.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.160]   They do it with the privacy statements.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.880]   They should do this with the subscription statements too.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   - Are those--
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   - Say again.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.200]   - So those are also self-reported.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.840]   So we're relying on these companies to--
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:18.000]   - Oh yeah, in fact, Jeffrey Fowler, your colleague did a really good job, I think, of
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.200]   tracking down how many people lie on their privacy label, like most of them apparently.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.960]   I was just shocked that there was no, I guess it's like a spot check system and that might
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.880]   also be the case here, just the pure volume of stuff in the app store being sent by spot
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.880]   check or if it's flagged.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   But Andy, I like the idea of anything is making a certain amount of money that should raise
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   your little flag.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.040]   - The only thing that occurred to me is this.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.080]   If you go to the market, you're trying to figure out how much something actually costs.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.960]   There is actually by mandate, not only here is the price of the thing, but here is the
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.520]   price per unit.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.600]   And I think that in addition, in that little table of price information on app store, it
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.840]   should basically say, here is how much this costs per year of operation.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.040]   And if it costs $5.99 and you own an outright, it will say $5.99 forever.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.800]   If you're charging by the month, it will say here is that times 12.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.400]   If you're charging by the week, here is that times 52.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.080]   It seems as though in an easy first step and yet another indication that Apple, I don't
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   think that Apple doesn't care.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.680]   I just think that the app store is such a big business for them that they really haven't
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.240]   planned on how difficult it's going to be to manage it.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.120]   And so they aren't managing it very well.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   - Yeah.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.400]   - And there's a tricky thing about Apple manages your subscriptions because it's all lumped
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   together.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   And if you look at your credit card statement, it's a fun charge.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   - That's right.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.240]   - And it takes an extra step to go see what everything is unless you have the emails turned on.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   - That's a good point.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.200]   - So it's kind of a surprise.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.000]   - Coming up in just a little bit, Apple had a number of events this year as they did last
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   year.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.400]   And we've got a list of Apple's events from April of this year coming up in a bit.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.440]   But before we get to that, I want to thank our sponsor, CashFly.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.680]   CashFly is more than a sponsor.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.200]   They actually bring you this episode and every episode of all of our shows.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.240]   There are content delivery network.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.760]   We've been using them for more than a decade.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.440]   They were a lifesaver when Twit first started.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.200]   But frankly, they're still lifesavers.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.800]   Now CashFly has an amazing solution for low latency video.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.360]   Deliver your video with CashFly, the best throughput and global reach making your content

[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.240]   It's kind of remarkable.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:44.400]   Ditch your unreliable web RTC solution for CashFly's new WebSocket live video workflow
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.800]   that can scale maybe not infinitely, but to millions of users.

[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.120]   them before your team does.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.440]   CashFly's amazing.

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:05.280]   CashFly's 10 times faster than traditional methods on almost all continents.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.920]   I guess they're not on Antarctica yet, but all six hapative continents, 30% faster than
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.600]   the other major CDNs with a 98% CashHit ratio.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:59.320]   We appreciate everything you've done for us, CashFly, twit.cashfly.com.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.760]   So every April, Apple has the first event of the year.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.680]   This year, I think there were a couple of surprises.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.120]   Let's take a look.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.640]   iPad Pro.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.800]   Now this is where they flexed.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.720]   This was wow.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.160]   The rumor was, Alex is very excited.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.720]   This is excited, Alex.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.240]   The rumor was that they would use mini LED display.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.880]   They kind of downplayed it.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.960]   I think that industry analysts and enthusiasts know what a mini LED is, but nobody else does.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.600]   So Apple didn't say, "Now, within a mini LED display,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.520]   they talk more about what it can do."
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.720]   But it became clear that it wasn't mini LED display.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:50.960]   Instead of what we thought the A14X, which would be essentially an M1, they just said,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.680]   "No, we're putting the M1 in this iPad Pro."
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.040]   Interesting.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.120]   That gives you some capabilities.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.360]   That gives you some things you've never seen on an iPad.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:08.240]   For instance, a Thunderbolt 3 port, which can do not only fast data transfers and charging,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   but video.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.440]   So you can now run an external display.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.080]   Six-way external display.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   Wow.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.760]   It runs.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.840]   And I wonder whether you can do video out, but with that kind of connection, you can do
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.160]   video in as well.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.360]   So you can capture me, Alex.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.320]   Now you're really excited.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.800]   How do you feel like I'm pretty excited?
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.280]   Sweet mystery of life.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.680]   I mean, it works in my head.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.800]   Like I don't know if it was anything about working.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.520]   Well, it could be a recording device because you can go to terabytes now.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.120]   So there's a lot of storage.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   And here was the shocker.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.280]   They didn't even say it.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:47.080]   They just showed it a slide up to 16 gigs of RAM on the one terabyte and two terabyte
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   models.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.000]   It's a touchscreen computer at this point.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.800]   Essentially, your choice now is which operating system you want.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:01.360]   You want iPadOS or macOS because otherwise it's pretty much the same hardware, right?
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.800]   With touch.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.080]   Now we know why they have a put touch on macOS.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.520]   Well, no, it's I think I still think that's a dogmatic thing.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.040]   But I have to say that in the middle of this presentation, I was in my banking app.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.640]   I have a special account just for like mad money.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.240]   I was moving money into the onto putting them on the plane.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.680]   I say, suit up, warning up in the bullpen.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.600]   It's $2,000 of Andy's money.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   I had a window open just in case they created that they started taking pre-orders immediately
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.120]   because this is Apple has always tried to make the statement that, oh, well, no, this
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   isn't this.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   This isn't just a computer.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   It's an iPad trying to make the statement that they don't think of this as a tablet
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.160]   that just is for reading books and for doing light computing.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.120]   This is a computer in its own right.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.040]   It does really real desktop type things, but only an exciting new form factor.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:03.640]   But this is the first time they've brought hardware that really just absolutely thundered
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.160]   home that point.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:14.000]   As it happens, just like my usual, the computer that replaced my iPad Pro as my, hey, I want
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.600]   something ultra slim and ultra light because I'm just going out for a few hours or just
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.680]   just off my bag has been this Google Pixelbook.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.240]   And it's a few years old and it chose next week for all the keys on the left side of
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.080]   the keyboard to die.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.880]   So I was actually already sort of thinking contemplating, okay, so what do I get as the
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.520]   new ultra light thing?
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:39.880]   And there are so many points in this presentation, particularly the high speed, high speed thunderbolt.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.000]   So high speed devices to be connected externally.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.040]   The addition last year of the ability to use trackpads and mouses with it and just the
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.520]   speed and capacity of this thing.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.920]   Also, I'll say the upgrades to the camera, the LiDAR, I really want LiDAR on an Apple device.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   And I was actually thinking about, well, gee, if LiDAR is going to be this interesting for
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.400]   doing AR and 3D, maybe I should buy a new iPhone just to get it.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   And they added that to this thing too.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.000]   It really does see it's there.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.720]   The iPad Pro was never cheap, but it's about the same amount of money that I spent on my
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.040]   first generation iPad Pro 12.9 inch.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.360]   And I really think I can justify it more than anything.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.560]   Everything else, it's gotten me excited about.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:31.240]   Yep, I will still accept some of the downsides of having an iPad and not a device that simply
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.080]   responds to a USB device by saying, oh, great, here's USB device.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.040]   Please have access to the file system and stuff like that.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.440]   The software that they're presenting for this.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.680]   And also, again, that wonderful, just the mission statement of, oh, no, we just put an
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.120]   M1 in there.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.760]   It will never run Mac software, believe it.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.340]   I'm sure that 80% of the engineering beside this was, let's make sure that no
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.920]   nobody can even possibly contemplate this.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.520]   But I really am excited about the future of iPad Pro with this device.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.920]   I think this was just a demonstration.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:08.760]   And I'm still kind of fill the chemicals from the Andy Watt shiny new thing experience.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.560]   And so I'm glad I got 10 days to sort of cool off and think about it.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.640]   But this is a really, really shot across the bow of every device that costs about $1,000
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.640]   in Windows.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   It tries to be hip and cool.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.280]   I think the RAM is telling.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.500]   It was up to now iPads have historically had scant RAM.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.260]   And the excuse was, well, iPad OS doesn't need it.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.740]   Four gigs was a lot.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:36.100]   And I think the most recent iPad Pro had six gigs, maybe eight.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.380]   But to go to jump all of a sudden, you can get it with 16 gigs.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.380]   What does that mean?
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.380]   What does that say?
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.300]   Boy, this is, I mean, it's also the price of a computer loaded up.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.300]   It's $2,400.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:51.260]   Like it is a real, like it when you put two terabytes of 16 gigs of RAM and two terabytes
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.920]   of drive space and a Wi-Fi and cellular, you're looking at $2,400.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.320]   You can put 5G in it now too, by the way.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.820]   And with millions or with?
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.820]   Holy cow.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:08.440]   Finally, there was just a still of Ted Lasso on the event last week.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.340]   And it said, you know, they talked about Sherbet Ted Lasso's secret sharp bracket makes
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.440]   about one box and they cut it off because it's secret, right?
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.600]   But, you know, it actually kind of see it.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:27.080]   David Smith wrote in his blog, well, that looks like a one and a half cups, 340 grams
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.080]   cold, unsalted butter.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.440]   And he said, oh, wait.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.520]   Did he make it?
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.640]   You googled it and look what you find.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:43.200]   You find a New York Times recipe that has exactly one and a half cups, 340 grams cold
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.840]   unsalted butter.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.640]   Three sticks cut into half inch pieces.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.920]   Now it's for a bittersweet brownie shortbread.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.200]   That's not what Ted Lasso's given people.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   So you'd have to take out the- But he's giving them American shortbread in London.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.280]   Actually, there is a regular shortbread.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.080]   It's a double, it's like a layer kick.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.600]   So one layer is just plain old shortbread.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.440]   All it is butter.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.280]   I want you to make it, Alex.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.800]   Butter, a lot of it.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   Three sticks.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.720]   You have a ton of home butter.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.040]   Three cups of flour.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.680]   Three quarters of a cup of sugar and a one and a half.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.000]   Soo-veed it, Leo.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Soo-veed it.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Soo-veed it.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Shortbread.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   What are you nuts?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   He's going to be shortbread.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Soo-veed it.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Soo-veed it.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Soo-veed it.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   It bakes in seconds.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Just brown it.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Isn't that cool?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.800]   So apparently Ted Lasso's shortbread recipe really is a shortbread recipe.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   That's fun.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   New York Times.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.120]   That's an awesome way to get people engaged is to-
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   Just enough.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   They knew people would do that.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.840]   It's like when NASA put up the design on the parachute.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.320]   Wasn't that awesome?
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   Everybody, they decipher that within hours.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   It was amazing.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.920]   Hello, Alex Lindsey from- Oh my God.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.200]   May the fourth be with you, Rum Sleg.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.480]   He's a bounty hunter with the galactic Republic.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   Nice.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.480]   Very nice.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.840]   Yeah, I was- You know, I brought it up this May 4th because I didn't know until maybe
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.920]   a month ago or two months ago that the action figure had actually come out.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   I was at a- What is Rum Sleg?
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   Is he a bounty hunter?
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.680]   He's a bounty hunter, evidently.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   I didn't know that when I was doing it.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.040]   I didn't really know what to do.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.520]   Is he from the original Star Wars universe or is he-
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.560]   No, he's from Phantom Menace.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.800]   So what happened- The story behind it was that they- I was working at- I was working
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.000]   at ILM and occasionally when you need extras, there's no reason to hire extras at ILM.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.960]   Someone just walks in and says, "You, you, and you."
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.120]   And they- Especially because they're wearing a costume that you can't really see.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   Well, that's the whole point.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   So anyway, so I was picked because I think I- because it looked like I would probably
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.960]   fit into the given suit.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.800]   And so they put me in a suit.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.480]   They had another- Someone else was supposed to be with me.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.880]   I'm actually- I look in the movie like I'm talking to somebody and I was talking to Jonathan
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   Roth.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   That's you?
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   Yeah, that's me.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.920]   You are Rum Sleg.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.120]   I am Rum Sleg, yes.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   This is the most obvious character.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.040]   That's my- And so what's funny is that- So that's me walking- You know, I was forced
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   because I was just walking into the front of the green screen.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.880]   Did you have to wear that outfit?
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.080]   Yeah, I wore the outfit, the whole outfit.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.120]   It was just me in front of a green screen with Jonathan Rothbard and Jonathan Rothbard
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:25.720]   got- I think that they ended up roto in mouth because you could see his face too clearly.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.280]   But I don't know for sure why they did that.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   But so now- So you're wearing a mask?
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   I'm talking to myself.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280]   Yeah, I was wearing that mask.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   I mean, there was nothing changed.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.480]   And you were talking to somebody who got roto- They got roto- They got roto-
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.840]   They got roto- They got roto- They got roto- They got roto-
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   So I stayed in.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:43.960]   And now we have to do a new Star Wars edit with that guy roto-ed back in.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.840]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.600]   So anyway, so I was- When you finished it, when I finished it, I walked off and they said,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.040]   "Okay, we need you to do T-Poses."
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.760]   And I was like, "T-Pose is what you do for 3D modeling."
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.520]   And I was like, "Why do you need a T-Pose?"
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.840]   And they were like, "Oh, it's for the action figure."
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.040]   I was like, "I'm gonna have an action figure."
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.480]   And they were like, "Well, they said, "We'll see."
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   You know, well, it depends on-
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.920]   You're in like the third demand.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   They said, "We just have to take the picture."
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.200]   You're in like the third tier or fourth tier.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.120]   You know, it's like, if the idea is, if you sell enough of the first one, you go to the
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   next tier, if you sell enough of that, you go to the next tier.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.560]   And he said, "But Star Wars, it could work."
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   This was the one, the first one.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   You know, we didn't know what was gonna happen.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.520]   Anyway, it didn't go very well.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.520]   And-
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.480]   There's no roto-slake action figure, folks.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   Well, no, no.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.560]   There wasn't at the time of the movie, but on the 10th anniversary, they released a new set
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   of action figures.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   Oh, no.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.560]   There it is.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   That's it.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.560]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.880]   So that means you're canon, right?
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   You are canon.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.880]   You're official.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   So hopefully someone will put that moment to watch.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   You didn't have a Disney+ here, Alex.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.880]   Oh my god.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   You could have a moment to watch.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.640]   I know you 20 years and I never knew this.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.480]   Well, it wasn't, you know, it was something that I didn't think about that much, but
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   so-
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   How about the guy got rotoed out?
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   Did he get an action figure?
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   You did.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.240]   You can put it in a bookable-fed?
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   You should call them right now and say you wanted to book a bookable-fed.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Yeah, so if I'm deciding-
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.680]   And T-box Star Wars action figure, that's him.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.760]   So yeah, so I've decided that I think this is going to be my Halloween.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.800]   Like if I go out with my kids, it'll be a little scary.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   I should do a-
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   You get to keep the costume?
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   Probably not, right?
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   They keep that.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   No, it wasn't.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   I'll be honest.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   It's a movie.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   It wasn't really that great.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.960]   It's not like a costume that would have held up.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.280]   It was the one that I'll probably end up making for Halloween.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.280]   It'll be much better, right?
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   It's really pretty pretty.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.280]   So, yeah, I'm going to-
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   Alex, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.240]   Would you like to know that the hard plastic prototype for that action figure is now on
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   eBay?
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.640]   I know, I know it is.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   I can't-
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.440]   I know that because I just bought my own action figure.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440]   Yes.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.440]   Nothing.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.440]   There's a rum.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   It's awesome.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   It was funny.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.640]   I tweeted it this morning and I went to eBay and there was like 29 people watching rums-
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.880]   They were just watching rums like on eBay.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.240]   Obviously, I made sure to buy a couple before.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.480]   Before I posted anything.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.840]   So I have my supply.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.280]   There is a prototype up there.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.560]   Now, unfortunately, we've talked about it on the show.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.200]   It'll probably be gone.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.960]   But I wasn't willing to pay.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.320]   I looked at it a month ago and I was like, "I'm not going to pay $545 for a rums leg."
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.800]   I have new sympathy for you though.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.400]   The fact that all the conventions are canceled for the past two years, that's kind of really
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   cut into your income.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.440]   There's a guy in the corner sitting at a table.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   He says he's rums-slag.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Well, I've been thinking about-
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   I've been thinking about-
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   I don't know.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   I want to do a fan film.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.120]   They're building up all these- as Renee was saying, they're building up all these marble
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.120]   things.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.520]   The ventures of rums-slag, I think, are on their way.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   The book of rums-slag.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   Yeah, the book of rums-slag.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.000]   Let me ask you in this- in this-
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.760]   Phantom Menace, are you on Tatooine?
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   Is that where you are?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   Where it looks like you're in-
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Yeah, it's Tatooine.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   Yeah, it's Tatooine.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.760]   It's Maus-Eisley.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   Wow, at the Maus-Eisley space-space.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.840]   Did you go into the cantina while you were there?
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   Have a drink?
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   It's a green screen.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   It's all green screen, baby.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.600]   I could imagine going to the cantina.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.400]   We almost built one for something like the cantina.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.480]   Because I think if rum was drinking rum in the cantina, that would be pretty exciting.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   Well, I think-
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.920]   It's funny if he asked for rum.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   Is it rum?
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   What I really want is my own brand of rum.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.920]   Yeah, it should be-
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   Yeah, rum-rums-slag.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   S-leg rum.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   Rums-slag rum.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:30.360]   That is totally a move that a star-wrest actor who's had one of those like one-light appearances-
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.360]   at the booth you'd be able to buy rum-slag brand like because he knows a guy in the liquor industry.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   But it won't be a problem because it's-
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   It won't be a problem because it's-
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   It's- It'll just call it-
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   S-leg.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   It'll be S-leg rum.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.360]   S-leg.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   I don't know.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   You need to know.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.320]   Apparently, you were cheering Saboeba at the pod race.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.520]   So that wasn't me.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.480]   So there's two of us actually.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   That wasn't-
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   That wasn't-
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.480]   That was the other rum-slag?
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   That was the other rum-slag, yeah.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   You were a human-
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   No, it was not-
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480]   That was the standard.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   Wow.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   I had the major one, but yeah, I had somebody else stand in.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.760]   I didn't have time to do that when I was-
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   I was on another-
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.800]   I'm officially in the canon, folks.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.960]   It was a lovely moment for your lighting double to get that moment and you know-
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   Because I tell those kids-
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   Did you attend-
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   Was that you at the Bunta-
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   I saw it the Bunta-classic Eve?
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   Was that you?
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   Yeah, no.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.160]   I don't know who got to wear that seat.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   That's his CGI.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   I don't know who else wore the-
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   That's what he came from his room.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   It's like, and I apologize.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.680]   The guy bidding on the prototype right now.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.640]   It was a little sweaty when I got into it.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.800]   Who was the guy in that fin suit?
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   That must have been terrible.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.200]   Oh, the fin suit.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   That's so hard to wear.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   The fin.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   You don't want to be fin.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.840]   I will say the rum's like- the rum's like suit was pretty hot.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   It's a scuba suit.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.840]   It's like one of the-
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.280]   Yeah, you know, in this shot they actually- it looks pretty ratty.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   I'll be honest.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   Yeah, it looked better.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.240]   It looked better and you don't take it too far.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.080]   That's honestly why I thought that it might have been- when I first saw that shot that you
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.640]   put up, I thought it might have been from like the episode- the year-old.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.200]   The original Star Wars, because it did look like- okay, what have we got in the prop house?
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.160]   Things that we just sort of put together randomly.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   Oh, when you put it on-
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.000]   You put a Halloween mask underneath it.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.800]   See, it's not a scuba suit in the action figure.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.600]   It's got little wrinkles and stuff.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.720]   Yeah, the action figures looks way better than the actual- the reality was much not nearly
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.400]   as good as the action figure.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.240]   It was- it didn't- like I was like, really?
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.960]   This is how all- it was a little bit of a- this is really how all these suits are.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.800]   It's called movie magic, baby.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.280]   But 24 frames.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   That's how we make it.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.000]   Well, it was all that way.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.720]   We were playing around with what I thought was a toy prop of Han Solo's blaster in the
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   ranch.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   We were like, I was thinking of real-
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   It was like, put the blaster down.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.000]   That's the original- the original-
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Wow.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.800]   Okay, okay, I'll put it down.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   Wow.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   So, yeah, so-
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   By the way, they had a day up.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:56.760]   At the ranch, May the 4th, the memo went out by an email saying, "Take time for yourself
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.560]   today to do whatever you want."
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:05.840]   So, Alex still has that bounty hunter run- run- sling on his desktop.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.160]   Everyone's a while he'll- he'll show it to us.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.920]   A lot of excitement, I think, rightly so, over Apple's beautiful colored iMacs.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:21.280]   Just slim, gorgeous, and light, and as usual, on the team, Renee Richie was the first
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280]   to get one.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.400]   Here's his review of the new iMacs.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   I guess the first question is-
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   I think it's-
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   So, this is the low-end iMac.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.640]   In fact, we're going to talk later about rumors that there is another iMac, more powerful
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.640]   coming.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.760]   But how low-end could it be with an M1 in it?
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.440]   Does it feel pretty snappy?
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.640]   Yeah, so, I mean, M1 is so interesting to me because I'm used to Apple.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.400]   Apple did this whole Silicon architecture thing.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.680]   They didn't want to become their own Silicon vendor with, like, every single device as
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.520]   a separate customer because that would lose every advantage of making their own Silicon.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.160]   So, they created this scalable architecture and now they have the M1 and the iPad Pro going
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:06.480]   all the way up to the iMac and it performs the same in all of them, but they use it for
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   different things.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.120]   Like, they were very savvy in figuring out that efficiency leads to performance.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.400]   So, they can use M1 to have world-class performance but huge battery life in the MacBook Air or
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:23.160]   the iPad and they can use M1 to let them whittle down the chassis on an iMac to almost nothing
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   and give you, like, a modern version of that translucent iMac take, not because the plastic
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.040]   is see-through but because the thing is almost do dimensional.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.280]   So, it's- it's- and it doesn't miss a step.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   Like, it is every bit as powerful as any of the other M1 Macs.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.760]   It's just- it's a really interesting, really smart product decision, I think.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.840]   Yeah, I mean, everybody focuses as we just did on the color.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.520]   The design, you know, is a refreshed design but it is kind of feels like as thin as it
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.800]   is, it's like a giant iPad on a stand.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   But-
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   It's like the MacBook Air of iMac for the first time.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   And it's a small screen.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.360]   I mean, it's bigger than the 21-inch but it is not as big as a full-size iMac or iMac
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.880]   Pro and I think the rumor is that the next one's- next Pro iMacs will be even larger,
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   like 32 inches.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.200]   Does the screen feel constrained to you?
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.760]   24 is not bad.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.360]   No, it's- and because it's so thin, like the interesting thing about this is that you
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.440]   can fit it into almost any nook and any cranny and because it's not a giant silver bubble
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.840]   butted backed wedge, it's not as obtrusive as the old iMac.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:32.040]   I put my 27-inch slide by side with it and it just- it kind of melts away in an interesting
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.720]   way and I heard a bunch of other people talking about them like, "Yeah, my family would never
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.840]   let me put an old iMac there but they have no problem with an orange one or a green one,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   right in the kitchen?"
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.560]   It's all psychological but it holds together really well.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.040]   So is that a market, guys?
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.480]   I mean, the market of the people who want a computer but don't want anybody to know
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   they have a computer.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   I guess it is.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   It's a computer.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.280]   I want people to know I have a computer.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   Yeah, me too.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.720]   But you know what- and to Renee's point, like, for instance, in our house when you first
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.680]   walk in, we do have a little nook that we cut into the wall purposely to be like, "I
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.720]   like the communication stand, right?"
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.280]   That's where you get the mail, grab your phone off the charges if you do not disturb
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   her.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.920]   I tend to have my phone next to me.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.440]   Pull up the watch off the charger.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.200]   Everything is in this one little place.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   It's the perfect place to put a smaller iMac.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.960]   It doesn't have to be super powerful.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.040]   It's close enough to the kitchen.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.360]   I could pull up a recipe or something real quick but it's a good, nice little place to
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.880]   have a small hub and I know a lot of people have similar condenses and things like that
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.520]   or a community computer.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.880]   Say someone comes over.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.680]   I can't, for work reasons, I can't let them use my laptop but so I might need to use
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   a computer.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.800]   Now I'm not suggesting you go out all ballerific and go buy a really high-end one but it's
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.280]   a good thing for a lower computer.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.840]   So I think the fact that it has a little bit of that beauty utility to it as well lets
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.200]   it lend in for a good design as a home computer.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.760]   That's really interesting.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.000]   So now you're saying it's good for a second computer or a third or fourth?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Absolutely.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.880]   It's the extra computer, the one that you use for just checking things in the kitchen.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.880]   Remember that old-school device?
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   Sorry Andy.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.720]   Remember that old-school device?
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   I forgot what it was.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.040]   It was made by 3M.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   It was white.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.600]   It was super kind of ugly at the time but it was the for Aubrey.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   That's what the Aubrey was.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   The Aubrey was a kitchen computer.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.200]   They even built it in a way.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.840]   Yes, it didn't fly but nowadays we're getting to the point where something like this could
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.400]   happen so yes.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.000]   Andy what did you want to say?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.120]   All I was going to say is that it's interesting that Apple is even continuing the iMac line
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.320]   because all in ones on the PC side of life, they aren't really a big factor.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:48.560]   I think Apple themselves have said that iMacs are not the general people who walk into
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.360]   an Apple store to buy a Mac don't come in intending to buy an iMac.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.840]   They're for special users and special situations as opposed to a Mac mini or a MacBook that
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.440]   are more general purpose computers.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.200]   Again, this is the sort of things that people are coming in to buy.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.480]   For someone who wants an all-in-one, they have to have a reason for doing it and one
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.520]   of them would be I have a household.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.440]   I'm not going to buy my kids.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.640]   Each of them a thousand dollar laptop or twelve hundred dollar laptop.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.360]   I'm going to buy one nice all-in-one that doesn't take up the entire living room, doesn't
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.680]   take the entire kitchen or whatever and that's going to be the family computer where we have
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   basically all of our accounts on.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.160]   It's an interesting thing.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:32.840]   Whereas the iMac used to be just like the original Mac Plus, Mac 128, Mac 512, Mac SE
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.640]   was here is the box that you have, that here is the box that you come in to buy, the iMac
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.800]   that you come in to buy as a Mac.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.720]   This is now the, it's nice.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.120]   It's the utility out fielder, gets the job done, fills out the roster, but it's certainly
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.000]   not the sort of stuff that's going to get most of the press at the end of the day.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.080]   It has a MagSafe connector on the back which I thought was interesting.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   How does that work?
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.520]   Does it fall out easily, Renee, or is it pretty secure in there?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.440]   No, no, it fits in really, really well.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.720]   It's got like a, you know, see if I can hold it out, it's probably too far away, but it's
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.280]   got sort of a ring on the outside and then a little nubbin in the middle and the whole
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.800]   thing goes in and sticks in magnetically.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   Does it snap in?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.640]   It's got a nice satisfying snap.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.120]   Well a magnetic sort of a "fuck."
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.200]   You know, like we're all addicted to the AirPods case, you know, snapping it up in close.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.920]   It's like "fuck, fuck, fuck."
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   It's really 50 minutes.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.200]   It's trying to say my name with a list.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   Thakrok.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   Thakrok.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.000]   But the interesting thing is they're transiting, they're transiting ethernet over this cable
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   as well.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.320]   If you get the higher end MagSafe adapter, yeah, and you can plug it in and I'm guessing
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:45.480]   because the thunderbolt, the on-package thunderbolt ports are being taken up that it's using USB.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:51.120]   And I'm kind of like, I'm more USB ports on the power adapter because why not?
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   It's off your desk.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.120]   You can plug it in and do it.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   Let me plug the printer.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   Absolutely.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   I don't know how well that would work with the printer.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.640]   I give inside the brick.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   Inside the brick.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   I like it.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   Go ahead and go get it.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.400]   Come on Renee, we want to see it.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   Go bring it to me.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   Do we know we got it?
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.400]   He's going to run and get it.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.720]   Now we can talk about how jealous we are and how much we hate him that he got a previously
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   side-macking.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   Oh, look at the front.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.760]   Oh, Thakrok, is it beautiful?
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   Do you love it?
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.000]   I'm in love.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.840]   Now, of course, the only complaint I've heard about this at all is the white bezels.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   And you can see them there.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   I know.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   I think you're right, Thakrok.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.320]   This is not the computer.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.600]   You put it at your workstation for editing photos.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.880]   This is more really a family computer kind of thing, right?
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.320]   So the white bezels wouldn't be.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.600]   See, you know the sad part about M1?
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.840]   I shouldn't say the sad part.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.200]   But the part about M1 that's going to be impressive people is it is so powerful that
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.360]   you are going to want to do those things.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.040]   But when they put it out there, they weren't thinking, hey, we want to put out this work
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.560]   station that comes in Fruit Loop Colors, right?
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.960]   It was intended to be a fun ex-you know, Apple, they love to add fun and excitement
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.360]   and things into the product.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.520]   That's part of their character identity.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:10.120]   And as Renee said, they have been recently following this design language that is very
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   on point.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.040]   Like they have been very, very specific with their design language.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.240]   So I think for me personally, it's a dope computer.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.080]   And although you can edit your photos and things on it because people are going to be
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.440]   coming from a hiring iPhone, hiring iPads, and that I'm not going to replace my studio
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.960]   computer with it.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.480]   But it is a fantastic get some work done when I'm at the house, let my niece use it when
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.200]   she comes over, don't have to worry about her harming anything.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   So yeah.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:45.160]   This is related to pandemic or if it's, you know, design goes through cycles.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.840]   Apple clearly color is in Google today at its Google I/O, announced their new design
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.520]   language for Android 12 material, you and it's all about color, customizable colors,
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.080]   picking up the color of your wallpaper.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.880]   Can I tell you why I hate this though?
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   Why?
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   Leo?
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   Why?
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.480]   So I like it in general.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   And I like the white bezel.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.720]   I thought I would hate them because I'm all in on the black bezels.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.600]   But in a room, like when you put it in a house, they fade away.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.360]   Like most people have lighter colored walls or colors in black.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.080]   It just sticks out so much.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.920]   Yeah, no, but only Alex Lizzy has 30% gray walls.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.920]   Did it feel stable?
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.400]   Is the stand very stable mockups?
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.360]   No, it's totally stable.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.760]   But I mean, like on the subject of the nostalgia marketing, like to me, I always think of the
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   watchman, not the movie, but the original comic book where Adrian White was having like
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.000]   this futuristic millennium marketing.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.960]   And then the minute the doomsday clock started counting down, he switched to nostalgia and
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.320]   explained that whatever people are stressed or anxious, whenever they're worried about
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.000]   the future, you remind them of their past because that's comforting and warm and nurturing
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   to them.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.200]   It gives them those feelings of better days and better times.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   But it's in the past.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.120]   It becomes hard to move forward.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.640]   So like I really want to push back against like nostalgia marketing because I think that's
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   really cynical and hope that they're to that like a next step forward.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.360]   Reintegrate the good things about them, but don't try to make us feel like don't pander
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   to our anxiety.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.040]   It's hopeful for the future again.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   I also note related or not that Apple is confirming that they are discontinuing the space gray
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:25.400]   magic keyboards, track pads and mice, the keyboards that came with the space gray iMac
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   Pro.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   I'm going to keep mine.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   They're going to be collecting.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.600]   So color is in this year.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   It's back.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.880]   I mean, it's totally sick.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.880]   Like I mean, it happens in fashion every decade or so.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   It is more human.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.440]   Like colors are so like colors.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.520]   Sometimes we want to be more sedate and then sometimes not, I guess.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.520]   Did you do it?
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   The brave segment.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.520]   Go ahead.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   Sorry.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.520]   And you and I are having fun today dancing.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:57.320]   I was going to say the brave segment of this is when the when we had it back in the past,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.760]   one of the things that was always weird was you go into the stockroom at that time I
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:06.320]   was at Compu USA and there'd be all of one particular color left or all of another particular
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   color left.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.760]   Everything else is sold out.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:13.840]   But I think now like the planning of, you know, making sure you have the right amount
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.920]   of colors in the right space, it's very hard to do.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:22.600]   So I wonder like what type of thought they put into like we know for effect red, blue,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   automatically gone.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   Those are still management.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.640]   I'm just wondering how you manage that.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:33.360]   That part to me is brief, very brief right now for something this price.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.080]   Famously, it's the thing Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple as he cut the SKUs
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.400]   because he can't you can't do that many different.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.400]   But he introduced the colors like he gave us that's true of the on the baby.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   Bondi, baby.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.480]   I'm Max and the my books and then he canceled all of it and gave us a decade of the blasted
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.560]   aluminum.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:56.240]   I really honestly think it's you have to keep your, you know, ear to the rail on fashion
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.240]   and it changes.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:04.000]   I've been watching Netflix as a great series with you and McGregor on Halston, the designer
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.560]   who brought color to women's fashions in the 70s.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.160]   And it's it's very much that same thing.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.280]   It's like, oh, it's been, you know, black and white Chanel suits and all of a sudden
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.640]   there's color and there's form and this is what happens in design and it's it's all
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.720]   cyclical the at the Google I owe the designer.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.960]   The Google I owe designer came on.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.600]   Was his Matthias came on to talk about it.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.600]   Tastuarte.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:35.520]   Matthias, he's the guy who does material design and he's doing the new material you.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.240]   And let me see if I can find his quote.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:41.600]   Emotion is essential and beauty is everything.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.880]   And that's how he announced the new color palettes for the material design.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.640]   So I ever love him from WebOS.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.560]   He can do no wrong in my eyes because he made WebOS.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.160]   He's a good designer.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.160]   And he comes on.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.320]   He wears floral print shirts and stuff.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   He's famous for that.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   So good.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   I'm glad color is back.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   Anything else to say before we let you go about the new IMac.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.680]   Any other thoughts?
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.880]   The camera is actually good.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   I mean, it.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.880]   Oh my God.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.600]   He is in potato cameras on the Mac books for a while.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.000]   The 1080p cameras on the IMAX were good, but they had the T2 image signal processor,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.360]   which is an A10 repurposed A10 chip.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.200]   And this has basically the A14.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.520]   The M1 is analogous to the A14 in terms of silicon IP.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.840]   So it's got the same every single processor as an iPhone.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:32.000]   And if you had a YouTube drama or like T channel or like a reaction channel, you could
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.680]   totally film it with this camera and these microphones.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   Wow.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.680]   And the speakers are ridiculous.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.080]   Like, I know there was a whole bunch of convection.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.080]   I'm sure you guys will talk about it later.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.800]   There was a whole bunch of convection about Apple not putting lossless audio into a lot
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   of their Bluetooth devices.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.480]   But they spent so much of the last three years.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:57.080]   They're doing it from everything now.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.680]   And like they've got speakers in this IMAX that have no right to sound anywhere nearly
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.040]   as good as they do because this thing is like a stretched out.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   I don't know.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.680]   It's like a griddle or something.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   It is so thin and it's got the same sort of the force canceling technology that the MacBook
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.680]   Pro has.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.720]   So it's got really good bass without it shaking your table.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.440]   The whole thing is really well done.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.480]   So you're making me want one, even though I know I shouldn't buy one.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.000]   Wait for the big one.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.080]   Who should not buy this besides me?
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:32.000]   If you want to be able to throw something in your bag, you're going to want an item
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   or a MacBook.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.520]   It's just like if you need your computer, you don't throw an IMAX in your bag.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.520]   But yeah.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   Well, I mean, Mark has take.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.720]   So I'm not going to be judgy about it.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.880]   If you want to take it to the coffee shop as the ultimate after lockdown flex, like you
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.360]   can, it's 10 pounds.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.400]   But for just moving around your house, it's fine.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.320]   But I think it's really, or for people who really want to do workstation level work, there's
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:50:03.160]   going to be an M series, IMAX Pro, within the next year that will give you way more cores
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.800]   and way more ports and just way more of everything, things that are really appealing
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.360]   to pro users.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.880]   But I think if you're looking for a computer for your home, it's really hard to get good
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   displays these days.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.080]   People discount the value of a good display and Apple has one of the best display teams
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.080]   in the world.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.920]   It's hard to get a display this good that costs as much as the IMAX and you get a free
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.880]   Mac thrown in with this.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.560]   So if that appeals to you and you want to be able to put it anywhere in your house and
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.720]   have it look like a piece of decor and not a piece of technology, you want it for the
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.960]   kids, you want it just as a home computer, you want it in your spa and front of house
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.960]   at a gym.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.200]   Places like that, places that I think want to have a real humanistic feel and a really
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:47.760]   big high quality display, I think that's the sweet spot for this.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.320]   Price as configured, that particular one you have.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.600]   This is the, I believe it's 69 is the gigabyte one tera, it's not too bad.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.360]   Say it again, you break, you broke up.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.920]   Say the whole thing again because you broke up.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   Oh.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   Sorry.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.440]   It's two terabytes, sorry, it's one terabyte, 16 gigabytes.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.960]   There's not a lot of options anymore with the M series processors.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:16.440]   You don't get to configure like the number of porous or frequencies.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.560]   Two ports in the back, right, Thunderbolt ports.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.680]   Two Thunderbolt plus two USB three.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   Two USB.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   Okay.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.640]   So they all look the same so they have a little Thunderbolt icon on it so you can tell the
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   difference.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.200]   It's really, it's tempting.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.600]   And what did you say the price was for that model?
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.600]   Do you know?
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.920]   I believe this one is 1699.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   Okay.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.400]   So it's not, I mean, nothing Apple does is cheap.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:44.240]   It's still expensive in that, you know, compared to other people's computers.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.640]   They started 1299, but as configured, that's about 1699.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.080]   But still tempting, you know, if you needed one for the, you know, where you put this
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.240]   on the phone desk.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   Yes.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:00.720]   Somebody has a phone desk anymore, but if you had a phone desk, that's where you would
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.040]   put this.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:07.840]   I really like this idea and it's really not just a Monterey features and iOS 15 feature
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:15.120]   of being able to put my iPhone iPad Macintosh and my iMac all together, my laptop.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.600]   And then moving the mouse from one to the other and using the same mouse and keyboard
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.200]   and all of them, that's, you know, you could do that with synergy and other third party
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   tools in the past.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.600]   But now I'm really excited.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.480]   I can also drag files.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.120]   This means the iPad Pro is suddenly, I was the right thing to get.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.880]   It's going to be where my photo workflow starts.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.280]   But now I can easily, after I'm done doing whatever I want to do on the iPad, drag it
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.760]   to my iMac for the finishing touches.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.640]   That was one of the nicest demos I think Apple has ever put into a keynote.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.360]   Because it's like, there's not like, load in this app and make sure you register this
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.680]   device with this device, make sure you use monitors to you so that you tell like the,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.360]   there's going to be a host Mac and got to make sure that the host Mac knows exactly where
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.280]   the iMac is or the iPad is in relationship to its own desktop.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.760]   It's like, no, you see, I put the iPad next to the thing.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.320]   All I have to do is keep moving my mouse cursor to the right.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.800]   At some point it leaves the, leaves the Mac screen and enters the iPad screen.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.560]   And if that pointer is on the iPad screen, suddenly my track, suddenly the trackpad belongs
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.200]   to the iPad and the keyboard belongs to the iPad.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:25.360]   And as you said, if I've got, if I've got like, if I got Procreate and I've got a project
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:29.920]   that I was drawing in that, that app, I can simply use the mouse, drag it from Procreate
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.280]   and the iPad into a timeline.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:39.800]   And if it really is as simple as that where, no, you don't, you have to make sure, I'm
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.240]   sure that at some point you have to flip a switch and say, yes, please use this feature.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.320]   But man, there's just the simp.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.560]   That's exactly how it would work in a movie.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.480]   And then nerds will have got to say, Oh, for God's sakes.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.720]   It would never work like that.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.680]   There would have to be some sort of a Christian's thing.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.400]   And you have to click some buttons.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   So yeah, that's it.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.560]   And I'm absolutely with you.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:04.240]   This is the sort of faith, leap of faith that I made when I bought the new iPad.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.600]   You don't need the new iPad to do it.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.400]   I think it goes all the way back to, I think, I think the specs actually say any iPad Pro
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:17.040]   and most machines made in 20, I think the earliest Mac is the 2015 MacBook Pro.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.520]   So you, it will work on existing hardware.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:25.640]   Yeah, this is, if you bought an iPad of any stripe with the idea that you at some point,
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.040]   Apple's going to make this so well integrated into your desktop experience that it is going
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:34.160]   to be not a case of, Oh, I'll have to upload something into iCloud that download it from
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.240]   iCloud.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.080]   But this will actually be an extension of my of my digital experience.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.240]   This was the payoff.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.680]   That's a really, really wonderful feature and I can't wait to get my hands off.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.960]   I can't, you mean, you're just having the 12.9.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.880]   You know, they've had this with Duet, the ability to share the screen.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.440]   But this is, you just put it down.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:55.000]   It looks like they say no configuration, no setup.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   It just works.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.480]   Yeah, they said, I was reading someone online who says that they got some more information
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.120]   about it that it's actually a very, very simple hack.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:09.080]   Where switch, the feature, well, no, the feature assumes that if you're moving this, that you
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.560]   know where the iPad is.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.960]   So if you're moving, you're the mouse pointer off the, off of the right hand side of the
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.240]   screen, that must be where the iPad is or that must be where the next device is.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.400]   And that's where it's going to go to look for it and go find it.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   I don't know.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.880]   I don't know how it works that way.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:28.000]   But I think that the biggest win of this would be if it really is as simple as that
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.680]   where it locates each other via Bluetooth or something that knows it's knows where each
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.840]   device is.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.440]   And based on that, you don't because you've enabled this and in preface, you're good.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.280]   Here's the fine print.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.040]   Available on the Macbook Pro 2016 later, Macbook 2016 later, Macbook Air 2018 later, iMac 2017.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:58.920]   And later 5K iMac 2015 iMac Pro, Mac Mini 2018 letter Mac Pro 2019 and iPad Pro, iPad
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:04.960]   Air third generation and later, iPad sixth generation and later iPad mini fifth generation
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.200]   letter later.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.360]   Both devices.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.400]   This is actually a hint as to how it's working must be signed into iCloud with the same Apple
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.480]   ID using two factor authentication.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.960]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.440]   I think that's for security, but maybe also a nudge to get people using two factor to
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.240]   use wirelessly.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:29.480]   Both devices must have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and handoff turned on and must be within 10 meters
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   of each other.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.280]   That's the range of Bluetooth iMac and iPad and Mac must not be sharing a cellular and
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.440]   internet connection.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.680]   You can't be hotspotting.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.040]   You can use it over USB, by the way, but you must trust your Mac on the iPad.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.840]   So I think this is going to be the next step from Sidecar.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.800]   But I think it's a really interesting step.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.720]   And the more importantly, the drag and drop.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:01.440]   Because really the iPad has felt like this kind of sealed box that it's hard to get files
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.880]   into and out of.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.160]   You don't even really know where the files live.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.240]   The idea that you could be in Procreate and just say, "Well, put that in keynote on the
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.560]   Mac is really interesting."
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:17.760]   The very first iPhone that came out you could get was in June.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.040]   I waited in line.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.880]   So I debated whether going to San Francisco to the San Francisco Apple store and I thought
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.360]   that's going to be crazy.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.440]   There's a pictures of Robert Scobel and Scott Bourn and others coming out of the store doing
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   this.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.440]   This is what everybody did.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:37.720]   That's the New York store holding up the bag going, "I got it, I got it!"
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.080]   That's Vincent from Slash Gear.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   That's a famous story.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   Oh, really?
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.080]   My Steve Jobs.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.080]   Oh, nice.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:50.240]   People waiting in line was absolutely how you got an iPhone for the first few years.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.560]   I waited in line.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.320]   This is from 9 to 5 Macs.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.800]   Wonderful kind of look back, a retrospective.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.720]   I waited in line as it turned out in the local.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.720]   I thought, "You know what?
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.040]   I'm going to have a better shot at getting one because you couldn't pre-order online.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.960]   You had to get in line at a store and stories had a limited number."
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.160]   This was for the first few years.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.640]   I thought, "I'm going to wait in line at my AT&T store."
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.120]   It was fun waiting in line for the first few years was really fun.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.120]   You'd meet interesting people.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   Do you bomb her with you?
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   No.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   I was right.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   It was in Petalume and I was not there.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:28.080]   I was behind the two guys who worked on Google Reader at the time, Google's RSS program,
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:34.560]   and they said they'd been up all night making a work on the iPhone, which is pretty cool.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   Wow.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   And I bet that they were there.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.240]   I bet that they were there almost professionally saying, "We need to send some people down
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:47.320]   to buy an iPhone and then right as soon as the charge bar gets to 22% see if the system
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.320]   actually works."
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.320]   I think it let us know.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.320]   Here's the Seattle store.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.320]   You did.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.320]   You were an Eric?
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   No, Eric won't share his.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.280]   Here's the Seattle store pulling back the curtains.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.680]   iPhone World premiere tonight.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.680]   It's 6 p.m.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:03.360]   I forgot that because later years we waited overnight, but it was actually smarter than
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.360]   them to do in the evening.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.360]   What did you do, Renee?
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.360]   You weren't able to get it in Canada.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   No, I had to wait until it was jailbroken and then have one smuggled by Jawas over the
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   board.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   I did that forever, MacArthur.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   jailbroken and brought it because you could do it at the time and then put it on your networks,
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   Rogers.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.360]   And then it was a TIFF exploit.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.360]   You had to do this load of TIFF picture and just the fuck in your phone was jailbroken.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.360]   It was amazing.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.160]   Here's Steve Wozniak going in the Palo Alto Apple store.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   All the different and it's legendary that, of course, someone at the inside the Apple
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.760]   store would see Steve Wozniak of all people just waiting in line in a deck in a folding
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   chair and say, "Oh, no, come in, come in."
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.240]   And Wozniak, no, I want to be outside with everybody.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:51.120]   I want to wait in line like everybody else.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.960]   Here's a wonderful photo I have not seen before from the Palo Alto store.
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:00.800]   That's Steve Jobs on the left, obviously, in the baseball cap talking to Bill Atkinson.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.560]   Next to Bill, the smiling Andy Hertzfeld.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.280]   The two, of course, guys who are most responsible for the first Mac.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.080]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.800]   Really need to see them in there.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.600]   It's too bad that really, I honestly didn't remember that this was the anniversary until,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.360]   of course, I'm on Twitter and suddenly everybody's like, give them their stories, "Oh, here's
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.920]   where I was and here's like a personal memory I have about the launch of the iPhone."
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.960]   And companies have to grow, companies have to move forward.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.520]   As they become two trillion dollar companies, they kind of lose that kind of personal touch
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.600]   is just what happens.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.400]   But it's kind of sad that we're kind of, no one's going to have stories 10 years from
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:50.520]   now, where were you when you got your first M1 iPad?
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.360]   Or even probably the Apple Watch.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:58.440]   But it does show you at the time when Apple was still very much on a rebuilding sort of
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:06.080]   redemptive arc as the folklorist would say, that it really did feel like we are the freaks,
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.360]   we are the geeks, we are the huddled masses, you're earning to breathe free.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.440]   We have a sense of community and we bond together through shared experiences such as, it wasn't
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.920]   so much that we wanted to be the first to have a trendy tech gadget.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.480]   It was that well, I bet that same reason why a lot of us are first in line to buy tickets
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.520]   for like a Star Wars movie.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.560]   It's like, I want to spend the night camping out and parking a lot with people who like
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.000]   me are crazy enough to want to camp out overnight.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   The crazy you want to see the first showing first day.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   It's pretty cool.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   I think different areas.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   Here's a picture.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.480]   I didn't, this is actually kind of surprising.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.440]   I didn't realize that the Apple store was selling the iPhone 2 online.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.120]   Francois Pou got this, put it up on Flickr.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.880]   This is, we'll be back soon.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.400]   It says on an iPhone, we're busy updating the store for you and we'll be back.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.120]   Yeah, Web Objects, we'll be back by 6 p.m. Pacific.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.360]   You could see it says Web Objects in the URL.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   W-O-A.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:16.280]   You can also see the, the vintage of this because Francois has dig news in his bookmark
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:23.360]   bar as well as delicious two things that have since come and gone and come again.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.720]   Here's the original iPhone.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   Here's the current iPhone.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.160]   Yeah, it's kind of funny.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   Promax.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   Like a baby phone.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.400]   It's so small.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:37.040]   This, I didn't, this has eight gigs of storage, which is, oh wait a minute.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040]   This one has 32 gigs.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   Make a pixel camera.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040]   So wait a minute.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   Am I confused?
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   Is this, this is the 3G?
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.040]   Yeah, that's the original one.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.040]   The one you left out.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.760]   No, that, no, that, exactly.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.440]   The one you're lifting up is the, because remember it had the, to make, to accommodate
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440]   the, oh yeah.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.280]   The antenna's, it had plastic on the bottom.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.080]   Also it was a 2G phone, not 3G.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080]   So this is the 3G.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.640]   I got the wrong one out.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.040]   This is the Apple, original Apple iPhone.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.720]   And this one only has eight gigs of storage, but you didn't need it because there was no
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720]   app store.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   What did you need it for?
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720]   Your music.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   It was an internet device.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.480]   I'm going to find a 30 pin cable and I'll charge this up because I'm sure it'll still
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   work.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.800]   Look how, the other thing to look at, I have a case on my iPhone.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   Let me take it.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.040]   This is actually as thick as the iPhone with a case on it.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.920]   Leo, the original iPhone could hollow out your Macs and use it as a tonton to keep warm
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.480]   as a winner.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.920]   Volume rocker.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:34.360]   No, oh actually, 30 pin, SIM slot at the top.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.760]   Here's the on/off button and it had a headphone jack.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.320]   Well technically it had a headphone jack.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   Exactly.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:49.920]   Because that curved bezel was aesthetically more important than usability, they've recessed
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.320]   it so deep that like a standard headphone jack would, it was a standard headphone jack,
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.000]   but your standard headphones would not actually reach deep down to actually make contact.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.200]   So you had to get this, again, it was the start of the dongle wars.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   Because you couldn't put a regular headphone jack in here.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   It was so deep.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.720]   The Apple ones fit fine, but anything wider than an Apple one, you had the dongle down
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.720]   there.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.120]   It's so tiny, and yet we were all thrilled to get this.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.720]   It was the biggest they could make at the time.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.560]   That was the biggest screen that they could fit into the device at the time.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.560]   Wow.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.160]   I have a bigger screen than this on my printer now.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.280]   Oh, compared to an Apple watch.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.840]   Yeah, it's kind of close to the size of the Apple watch.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.480]   It's the original Samsung watch was pretty much turned on.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.160]   The Apple store employees got special merch.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.760]   These are the launch shirts given to them Friday, June 29th.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.640]   The wait is almost over.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.440]   And say hello to iPhone.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.560]   Wow, this is just, I'm so glad that nine if I'm back, put this together.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.040]   There's the bag you got.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:04.240]   I remember that bag is if you didn't order online, I guess it was a really nice bag.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:10.440]   And of course, the packaging designed by Alan Dye quite famous.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.320]   Dye told students at Syracuse University, every single black iPhone box had to have its corners
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.160]   painted so that there wouldn't be any color inconsistency.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.640]   They wanted a black box that was completely black.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:31.760]   So some poor Chinese person had to paint every corner on every box to make it black.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.920]   That's what you got, like, that's what you got Apple interns for.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.360]   Yeah, really.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.960]   Come change the world with us.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.560]   But first, here's a Sharpie.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.160]   Here are a couple of master cases.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.080]   You got a lot more accessories in those days.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.640]   Of course, there was more room in the box because the phone was so small.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.360]   You got a white plastic dock that was designed for the iPhone, large power brick earbuds,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.440]   the 30 pin connector cable, a black microfiber cloth with iPhone.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.160]   Oh, I wish I had that embossed on it.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.960]   And a crystal clear tray that held the iPhone.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   This is a picture of all the things.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.560]   You could buy that Bluetooth headset that they made.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   That was like a, yeah.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   Wow.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:17.240]   And you can just imagine that the microfiber cloth was a specific demand from Steve Jobs.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.840]   Given all the stories that came out about how upset he was, about how bad the iPhone
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.360]   looked when he took it out of his pocket, like with the original plastic screen and the
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.480]   casing that he'd nothing, nothing must blemish.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   My precious.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.240]   Here's the iPhone stereo headset.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.240]   This was controversial.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.200]   The white color on the headsets.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.880]   People didn't make white headsets in those days.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.560]   It turned out to be a brilliant marketing move because anytime, I guess it was for the
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   iPod at first camera.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.560]   Anytime you saw somebody with white headsets, you knew, oh, yeah, there he's on an iPod.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560]   Even the ads.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.240]   Some of those iconic ads with silhouette and just the white headphones.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240]   Here's the iPod.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   iPod.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:07:01.760]   We've been testing the iPhone for two weeks in multiple usage scenarios in cities across
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   the country.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.360]   Our verdict, this is in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:10.200]   Our verdict is despite some flaws and feature admissions, like no cut and paste, the iPhone
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.520]   is on balance a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.360]   Its software especially sets a new bar for the smartphone industry.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.240]   It's clever finger touch interface, which dispenses with the stylus and most buttons
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.440]   works well.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:27.440]   Although it sometimes adds steps to common functions, a breakthrough handheld computer,
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.760]   he called it.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:34.680]   Pogge says quite famously in his review, the iPhone matches most of its hype.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.000]   Ed Begg who also got a early review unit, reviewed it in USA Today.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.240]   Stephen Levy for Newsweek said, "In a sense, the iPhone has already made its Mark Jason
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.760]   Snell, read for Macworld in 2007.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.320]   The iPhone is a real deal.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.080]   It's a product that has already changed the way people look at the devices they carry
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080]   in their pockets and purses.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.360]   After only a few days with mine, the prospect of carrying a cell phone with me wherever
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:01.000]   I go no longer fills me with begrudging acceptance but actual excitement."
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.360]   Nice job, Jason.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   Well done.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360]   He was so different.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.560]   The man who touched it for the first time would scroll and it would, the inertial, the
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.880]   rubber banding, it was just such an object in the classic Apple sense of object design.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.960]   I got a briefing right after it was introduced at the keynote, like three or four months
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.520]   before it was actually introduced.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.280]   I had I think like 45 minutes and Joss was there, a couple of other executives there.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   Wow, nice.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.960]   And usually that's an opportunity to, I got to maximize every minute that I'm there.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.360]   All the questions that I came up with, I can get a direct answer to.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.800]   But even there, I specifically remember saying, "Okay, go over to the banquet over there and
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.760]   get a cookie in a soda because I just want to spend 15 or 20 minutes just playing with
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   this."
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.720]   And I just remember it was just intoxicating after having things that scroll like pixel
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.040]   animation almost.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.640]   It was just so fluid.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.800]   Moving between apps was just perfect.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.440]   I must have gotten one of the ones that actually had Wi-Fi working because I was loading web
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.560]   pages and it was working.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:18.480]   It's hard to communicate the first time getting a hands-on with a device like this.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.120]   We're going to have more in just a little bit.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.000]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.640]   We'd like to give most of the team time off around the holidays and make the editors work
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   extra hard putting together and our producers, putting together a special best of for the
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   year 2021.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.200]   This is our Mac break weekly special.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   We continue on.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.920]   We spend a lot of time throughout the year talking about Apple's spatial music.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.440]   Some of us love it.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.720]   Some of us are less than impressed.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.360]   Here's just a summary of some of the things we said over the past 12 months about Apple's
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.000]   spatial music launch.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.880]   How do we feel about spatial audio now?
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.920]   It's been out for a while.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.080]   I've pros and cons from people.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:10.240]   Part of it is that producers are starting to learn how to do it better.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   Do we like it still?
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.240]   Are we still excited?
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   Are we excited about Alex?
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.360]   I can tell the difference.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.240]   I hear the difference.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.640]   I don't know if I need it.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.720]   I still think stereo sounds pretty good.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.800]   I guess if I had the choice, I'd choose spatial audio.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:35.320]   I think that what I'm hearing, and the hard part right now is that the issue is Apple's
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.240]   making everything sound better.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.680]   They're doing some kind of processing to all the songs that make them all sound a little
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.080]   bit better than what they did in old stereo.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.880]   They're doing something that dimensionalizes them.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.440]   I don't know what it is, but I can hear it even in songs that aren't necessarily out.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.160]   It's in some automated way.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.080]   The ones that are designed, what you're hearing is hit and miss.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.840]   Right now we're in that.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.840]   A lot of this comes down.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:10:59.880]   I think we talked about this before.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.520]   The difference between, I think that the folks who have done tons and tons of surround
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:12.480]   movies really understand how to do this, and the folks doing music, some of them do, but
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.240]   a lot of them don't seem to.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.720]   The issue is that, and this is the primary issue that I'm hearing constantly, is that
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:27.240]   they're choosing to, one set of engineers is mixing the vocals down the center channel,
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.480]   and one set is mixing down right and left.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.880]   Writing left is a music engineer doing what they would do.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.440]   Writing down the center is a movie engineer doing what they do.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.040]   Most of the movie engineers have done this for a lot longer.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:46.600]   The effect on me is that I hear this kind of echoey reverb thing between the two ears
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.880]   that isn't perfect, or it feels phased or something.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.800]   Yes, I've heard that as well.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.880]   That's because someone mixed the vocal down the right and left instead of down the center
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   track.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.160]   The center track is where you want to put the vocals, I have my opinion.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.000]   It has a different, like if you listen, a perfect example is, and I talked about this
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.760]   before, Rush's Tom Sawyer fills the music field more than almost any other song that
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:18.920]   I've heard in Apple Music, except for Getty Lee's, his voice is coming down right and
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.160]   left, and it has this weird kind of sound to me, you have a phase-y thing to me.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:33.680]   I mean, that's my, both, and you hear it more in a stereo, like I have 7.2 at my, or so.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:40.960]   Yeah, anyway, so 7.1 in my house, and the problem you get into is that I hear it a lot
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.080]   more in my stereo than I do in the headphones.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.600]   So anyway, so I think that it's, I still feel like it's the future, I think that, but I hear
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.920]   us wandering, like there's song, I think we're seeing the growth period.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.920]   We're still learning.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.480]   A lot of engineers are doing it, and a lot of what we need to do is have a big conference
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:03.280]   between surround engineers to talk to each other, trade notes, figure out what's better,
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280]   break things down.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.600]   I'm going to get a, one of the surround engineers that I know to probably do something in office
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.000]   hours, and we're going to, you know, where we just literally break down some songs.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   Let's talk about the songs.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.800]   Listeners send me a great podcast, darn it, I can't remember what it was, I'll have to
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.760]   look at my, but where they did get a guy who was doing a lot of spatial, who actually
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.440]   built a studio so that he could do it.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.800]   He's a remix engineer and talks a lot about the issues involved.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.800]   It was a very good podcast.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.120]   If I could find it, I will, I will tell you what it was.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.120]   It's complicated.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.360]   I, and I want to say that while I'm complaining about some of the mixes, learning how to do
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360]   it is a thing.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.520]   You know, I'm figuring out how to do it right now myself as a, as an exercise, and I'm
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.520]   taking something very simple.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.160]   I'm literally taking the, the sound that your iPhone makes when it rings.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.960]   I found the, I found the MIDI for that.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.920]   I didn't find the MIDI, I found the XML for that.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.000]   So I have it in Logic and I'm like playing with all the stuff and I'm kind of moving
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   around inside.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.760]   I'm just going to use that one piece of music to do with the Ambura, you know, that, that
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.040]   Ambura thing to, to kind of think through it.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.120]   And, and as soon as I got into it, I'm like, this is really hard, like it's hard to think
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   about.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.720]   And so, so anyway, so I have a lot of respect for the, the engineers that are doing it.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.840]   I think that that's, you know, a lot of them, the, the, some of the best ones are really
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.280]   subtle and I love listening to it.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.200]   The problem I'm having right now is that I'm so distracted when I listen to them.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   I can't do it.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.560]   I can't play music and listen to it because when I hear it, I go, oh, I really like what
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.560]   they just do.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.640]   Like, you know, like, why this is, this is so nice.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   It's so fun.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.880]   Like it's, it's not just music anymore.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.840]   It's like, it's like, oh, they put that there.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.200]   I, I don't know if I agree with that.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.760]   You know, like, and, and you're, you're thinking about the music in a different way because
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.840]   it's so much richer.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.800]   I mean, you can hear what I will say about spatial is the spatial songs more than it being
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:51.480]   more than stereo, you can, the detail on every instrument is way more, you know, you can
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.920]   hear more in the instruments.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.200]   And they're, they're an actual nature.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.120]   Then you could hear when they were all mushed together in stereo, you know, and I think
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.040]   that that's the thing that, that I'm noticing is there's more, more detail in the music.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:10.080]   Great interview in the Rolling Stone with Giles Martin, who is, of course, the son of
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.880]   the Beatles, very famous producer.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.680]   I don't want to say Don Martin, but he was in that magazine.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:18.720]   That's his name anyway.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.960]   But in this case, Giles, who has, who already was working with spatial sound because he
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   remixed.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.280]   Remember the Beatles love was a remix for the Cserk de Soleil show in a spatial theater.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:36.320]   And he talks, he's actually said, I'm unhappy with the Sergeant Pepper mix I did.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   He says, I'm going to change it.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.000]   It doesn't sound quite right to me.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.200]   It's out of notable music right now, but I'm going to replace it.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.440]   It's good, but it's not right.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   Sergeant Pepper was the first album ever mixed in Dolby Atmos.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.840]   And we did it as a theatrical presentation.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.800]   And he said, because it was mixed for the theatrical mix, it isn't quite right.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.840]   He's going to make it into what he's, what's called near field, Dolby Atmos, as opposed
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.720]   to the cinema, Dolby Atmos.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.200]   He said, you lose some bass and so forth.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.440]   Abbey wrote, he says, is better.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.920]   He says a better functioning atmos mix because it's much closer to the stereo mix.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.080]   And one of the things he did, I think it's fascinating, is that we can do this because
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.960]   we are, you know, Abbey Road with the Beatles.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.240]   He talks about John Lennon's vocal on Day in the Life.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.280]   He says, with the Beatles mixes because we have, I suppose, the money to do it in the
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:33.800]   luxury of time, what I and engineer Sam O'Kell tend to do as opposed to using digital effects.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:39.720]   We place the speakers back in studio two, which is where the Beatles recorded at Abbey
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.720]   Road.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.120]   We will re-record John's voice in studio two.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.240]   So what you're hearing is the reflections of the room he's singing in, so it's more
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240]   accurate.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   You know, must be nice.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   That's awesome.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.880]   I'm just thinking, like, they thought of doing that.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:01.440]   Like they're out drinking, you know, like, you know, maybe drinking anyway.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.240]   So, but they're like, why don't we just put a speaker in there?
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.000]   We can just do it for like three or four months of them trying to figure out how to record
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   that speaker perfectly, you know.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.600]   It's actually a really good article if you're interested in spatial audio and the challenges.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.680]   I mean, nobody knows better, probably than Charles Martin.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.000]   Nobody's had more experience with it.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.360]   That's such an interesting...
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360]   George, by the way, was his father.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   Thank you.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360]   Right.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.080]   But that's such an interesting philosophical question because this is maybe an ideal situation
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.320]   for the remix because Paul McCartney is still alive.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.960]   There is at least the DNA of what the original producer intended or thinks is right or wrong.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:46.200]   Because the original remixes were done with George had input as they were doing it.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.400]   But what happens when it's like 20 or 30 years from now and someone else...
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.800]   They're not even trying to make...
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.280]   They're not even trying to change it into something that it isn't.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.440]   But they just said, you know, with this new technology, we can really bring that baseline
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.240]   up and now make it more noticeable.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.120]   Like, maybe they decided not to make the bass very noticeable.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.120]   There's also...
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:11.040]   This conversation would be that there's a really nice documentary series on Hulu, at least
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:17.240]   Paul McCartney 3-2-1, where he and producer, I can't remember his name, but he's legendary,
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.600]   are at the mixing board with the mixing tapes for so much of his hits from the Beatles on
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.600]   forward.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.000]   And so much of it is talking about the construction of these songs, like them bringing up the baseline
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.800]   and noticing that Paul on this one song was almost doing like an entirely different melody,
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.560]   which is not something that you notice at all in this Beatles song.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:41.400]   Maybe you notice that he was playing a complimentary melody instead of just an accompaniment.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.240]   It would be a totally different song.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:49.800]   So as these technologies come forward, as we have the ability to add 3D to 2D television
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.240]   and do it through artificial intelligence and machine learning, as opposed to reprocessing
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.360]   it with thoughtful human intervention by the director, are we creating things that never
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:06.880]   existed and that the original creators never intended, all in the interest of creating
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:11.120]   topsy-turvy, tinsel and gloss, that this thing never actually needed the first place, just
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   to make it more commercial.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.200]   That's the thing about Beatles stuff.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.560]   You do that at your own peril because Beatles fans are very clear and very outspoken.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.760]   He says, "We don't fix errors."
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.840]   He says, "Sometimes when you do these remixes, you can hear, because you're listening to
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.960]   the vocal track alone, you can hear the vocalist be pitchy or something."
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.400]   He said, "But that's what made the record good in the first place."
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.600]   He says, "This is a highly recommended article."
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.720]   He says, "We start off with the stereo.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.800]   I feel immersive audio should be an expansion of the stereo field in a way.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.960]   I like the idea of a vinyl record melting and you're falling into it.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.760]   That's the analogy I like to use."
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:53.240]   The other thing he says is he says, "Be careful about using the surround."
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.720]   He says, "We are by nature forward facing individuals who don't like too many things
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.800]   creeping up behind us.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.480]   Sometimes I will with Dolby mixes and movies.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.920]   I remember the first time I had a surround sound system, watched a ball game, and the
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.120]   beer guy was coming from behind me.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.160]   He freaked me out."
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.920]   He says, "If you have a lot of sound coming from behind you, you want to turn your head."
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.000]   I get criticized sometimes for not being expansive enough with these mixes, but it's what I
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   believe.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.040]   I like the idea of falling into the record as opposed to being circled around.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.880]   I think we're in that place though.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:33.440]   When logic and when people get better at using resolve and fair light in resolve and as well
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.880]   as logic really becomes when it supports it natively, which is supposed to be this fall,
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.080]   when those things happen, I think you're going to see the same thing that happened with
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.880]   spatial as you saw with Photoshop, is that there's a lot of things that people thought
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.080]   were useful in advertising and layout and everything else.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.720]   It was all very stodgy and this is the way it was because you had all these Citex operators
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.080]   that went to school and learned all these things and you had designed people who went
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.160]   to school and they went to CalArts and there was a way to do it and everything else.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.120]   Then all these Photoshop users, those were me.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   That was me.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:14.520]   We got it in 1991, 1992 and we went crazy and we made tons and tons of mistakes.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:19.080]   I once printed an ad in New Mexico that was fully black because I didn't understand it
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.240]   because it was just a black square and they sent you proof.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.680]   When they do a print ad, they sent me proof back.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.680]   I just hit it.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.360]   I was like, I don't think anyone wants to see this.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.720]   We just spent $2,000 on a black square.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.360]   A lot of us got to play and you had Ray Gun which was completely unreadable and you had
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:44.720]   all these things that exploded out of it and then what we've settled into over time was
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.400]   something that is much more interesting and much more aggressive.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:52.480]   If you look at what our print looked like in the late '80s and then looked at what it
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.000]   looked like in the late '90s, it had just moved a century.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.280]   I think that what we're going to see with Spatial Audio is we're going to see this explosion
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.840]   as the tools get easier.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.400]   Every artist is going to design for it because you have a better chance of being featured
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.120]   on Apple Music.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.360]   They're going to design for it.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.600]   They're going to think about it and some of it's going to be horrible and some of it's
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.080]   going to be amazing.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.320]   It's not necessarily the images are better but I have more control over the image.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.640]   I can modify the aperture.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.440]   It's just more control.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.760]   Any smartphone, even if you're shooting in the manual mode, you just don't have as much
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.360]   control as you do with a real camera.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.920]   But again, what I adore about the way that all engineers who design smartphone cameras
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:40.080]   approach this, this is all about push one button and get the best image possible.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.120]   This was even occurring to me when they were demonstrating the cinematic mode where a
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.080]   lot of, I did have to tweet something snarky about this could become like the star wipe
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.960]   of amateur, like iPhone videos.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.920]   Oh, God, they're doing more more focused pulls like every time, every time something
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.920]   happens.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.240]   But in terms of, I just want to shoot a picture, I just want to shoot great video of my kids
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.720]   birthday party or my kids, whatever.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.280]   And the fact that it knows that, hey, there's something, it suspects there's something of
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.640]   interest in the foreground.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.400]   So I'll keep the foreground sharp and blur the background.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.880]   But as soon as somebody leaves the frame or turns around, hey, I'm going to make sure
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.800]   that the background or whatever they're looking at is now in sharp focus.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:23.600]   That's something that they obviously highlighted how impressed professional cinematographers
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600]   are for this.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.760]   But it could be the sort of thing where, again, just the person who I just want to tap one
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.560]   button to start, one button to stop and get a beautiful, get the best video possible.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.640]   I'm not even going to edit it.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.760]   I'm just going to be putting this straight into my social media or straight into an eye
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.880]   message or facetime for somebody.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.880]   And I'm curious as to whether that's a live feed that can go out of the camera.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.400]   So something like Filmic Pro, that's your new web page.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.600]   I'm going to stick it on there and watch it.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.200]   So I think that it's really interesting.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:56.360]   So Alex, let's talk about this cinematic mode, this pull focus mode.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:03.200]   Here's Apple's demonstration of it on their web page.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:09.480]   One problem, of course, is that the camera is deciding what to focus on.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.920]   Now there is a manual touch mode you can use.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.240]   In fact, there's a tracking mode, which is kind of cool.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.720]   You can touch somebody to say, "Track this face."
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.640]   But I have to say, I don't know.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.640]   Wait, wait, wait, to be seen.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.760]   Well, and I think that's going to work.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.280]   Yeah, I mean, I think that for someone who, an average person throwing together a movie
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.760]   for film school or for high school or...
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   It's going to pull focus.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   And you don't even know it.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   It could work really well.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.560]   And you just be like, "Wow, this looks great."
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.520]   I think that there's also probably going to be APIs that we can use that people can
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.520]   have control.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:45.240]   Like what's happening here is we're giving the developers a whole bunch of new tools
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.520]   that they're going to be able to go in there and say, "Okay, well."
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.920]   And again, the company like Filmic Pro will take that and run with it.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.360]   That comes back to my point with control.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.160]   Like I go to a pro camera because then I choose.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   Yes.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.040]   And I'm sure may have been racking focus and not even knowing it, right?
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.080]   It just, "Wow, how'd you get a rack focus in there?
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080]   What's that?"
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.080]   Right.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:06.920]   And so that's kind of cool.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.240]   They said something else.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.640]   And I want to ask Alex about this one.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.520]   The only smartphone that lets you edit the depth effect after you shoot.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.960]   Yeah, so when I saw it, I was like, "I wonder if they're going to give us that information?"
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.560]   And then I saw it, I was like, "Oh, I have to buy this phone."
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.920]   So it was like it was done.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.560]   So what they're doing is they're saving all that depth information in video format as
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.160]   well so that you have all that data so that you can go back later.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.440]   And I haven't seen any.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:37.560]   I have seen other technologies that do that, but never in a phone.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:44.240]   Is the phone recording multiple depths kind of like the old ray tracing or what it's
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.240]   called?
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.600]   So it can calculate out that the depth of everything in front of it.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.600]   But is it blurring?
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.200]   So it's software blur than not?
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.440]   Yeah, it's software blur, but it's pretty good.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.240]   The place that you're seeing it have trouble, even if you look at the demos that they have
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.880]   there are the blonde hair, the white hair, the areas where there's not as much contrast,
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:08.080]   you'll see little blurry wisps that are still going on.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.200]   So that's still happening just a little bit.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.200]   That's hard to do.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.560]   And that's really, really hard.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.520]   And so that's why in many cases you would not use this in a professional environment because
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:25.240]   it's not giving you that true depth of field that said in the right environments shot,
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.480]   well, for the right things, it could work really well.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.040]   And it could be really, really fun to shoot a lot of things.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.840]   And again, it makes it so much more fun just to go out and take pictures, little movies
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.840]   with your kids.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.960]   And again, TikToks and YouTube and all kinds of other stuff that'll be a lot of fun.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.320]   Andy and I were talking about it.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.600]   I decided, I think you agree, Andy, it's a content consumption device.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.560]   It's too small really to do much typing on.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:56.680]   I think it's really is, I hate to be so banal, but it really is the definition of larger
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.520]   than a phone smaller than an iPad or smaller than a tablet.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.320]   And that's for tasks too, where like you were saying, sometimes you spend so much time on
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.920]   Reddit, you spend so much time, I spend so much time keeping up with news, reading,
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.480]   reading for that papers, reading books, news, any websites and perfect for that.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.440]   I was last night reading a website, Lisa leaned over and said, what is that?
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.440]   Is it your Kindle?
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.440]   I said, no, no, it's the mini.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.440]   So that's perfect.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.440]   I said, yes.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.640]   Yeah, and it is nice to have something where there, when I'm out of the office for like
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.920]   three or four hours, oftentimes I will just stick something with a large screen in my
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:34.440]   pocket because sometimes, I see more so when I was writing for the paper than now, but
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.440]   it's like something happened right now and it'll be four hours for I can be back my office.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.160]   I definitely need to write 800 words right here, right now on this park bench.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160]   I guess I could.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.400]   I would want to, but I could.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:50.880]   It fits right in my European carry all very nicely fits in my jacket pocket.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.600]   My non-hipster, non-hip skinny jeans.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.700]   And notice, by the way, I keep the pencil on it and actually I was inspired by Omelik
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:03.480]   who wrote a little piece about how much he likes his mini and he pointed out that while
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.080]   you wouldn't want to do a lot of data entry on it because the keyboard is so small, the
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.440]   scribble, the new scribble feature in iPadOS is just right.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.200]   And the pencil is just right for a lot of the gestury kind of things that you want to do.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.920]   I think it's an instant notes and stuff like that because scribble is very accurate.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.520]   You can write in accurate enough.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.880]   I can write in Google searches into my browser and things like that.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.960]   So I kind of feel like the pen, it's a, it fits very naturally with it.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.880]   That's one of these in your bag, Leo, but just like the purple version.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   Yes, see, I have that.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.400]   I, Andy, remember, Andy recommended that folding thing that you put the keyboard in.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.440]   I have that.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   I don't want to.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440]   That color match.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.600]   That's two, that's, that's bigger than the iPad.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.320]   The whole point of this is compact.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.920]   I think the pen is the really important piece of it because for instance, you know, I build
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:57.120]   a lot of, I probably build one or two slide decks a week and I have a very specific pattern
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.960]   of how I do it is I lay it out.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.960]   I put it out.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   I sound like Liam Neeson.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:10.520]   I have a very specific pattern of specific set of skills that I've acquired over many
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.520]   years.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.160]   So, but my pattern is that I, I go into notes and I, and I write out, I outline what I want
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.280]   to do, what, what the slides are going to say.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.800]   I just find it easier to think about it in single words or lines.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.600]   Then I go to my iPad and I draw everything.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.280]   I draw every, I draw every slide.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.240]   I just look at notes and I just draw every slide and that a little, a little, it doesn't,
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.160]   I don't care how big the screen is.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.680]   These are like chicken scratches of, I'm going to have this here and then I'm going to have
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.840]   a little thing that goes over here.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:39.000]   And the reason I do that is because if you start building your slide deck, it's really
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.520]   easy for you to get caught up in like what picture and should these have rounded corners
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.040]   and what text am I going to use.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.880]   And you don't want to think about that when you're trying to think about the whole story
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.200]   flow of your, of your deck.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.280]   I have a phrase for that.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.160]   And the computer editing lends itself to dicking around.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.800]   I didn't want to say that.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.200]   But yeah, that's the key.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.000]   And that's the, dicking around is the enemy of productivity.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.080]   So, so what you do is you get the whole, first you get the outline done, then you get the
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.040]   visual story done and then you, and then you fill it all in with graphics and then you
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.120]   tweak it all and then you're done.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:16.240]   And now the filling in with graphics and the tweaking, I do all in, in, on the desktop
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.600]   because the, it's too hard to do that in fine detail and on the iPad.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:24.480]   But then I oftentimes present from my iPad, you know, so I either present it via airplay
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.000]   or I hook it up to an HDMI output.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.920]   And I mean like 99% of the time I'm, I'm displaying.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.840]   And so the mini, I hadn't bought it yet, but I decided last night when I was, I was
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:38.040]   using my large iPad and I was like, I really want a smaller one.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.800]   I decided last night I have an order one.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.880]   So the one, the one I don't have is the 11, which might be perfect.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.880]   I don't know.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.480]   The 12.9 is so big.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:46.480]   It's a computer.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.480]   It's a laptop.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.480]   That's the one I have.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   You know what?
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.480]   That's all I bought for a while.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.960]   On Saturday, a certain person, M. Georgia Dow stole my 11 inch iPad for the exact same
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   reason.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.280]   She's been using a MacBook Air.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.840]   She hated the 12.9 inch.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.840]   She goes, what's this?
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.840]   It was just on the table.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.840]   It was mining its own business.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.840]   I was the 11 inch.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.840]   What?
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   Mine now.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.840]   Yes.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.800]   The mini is, the touch targets on it are really, really small.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.000]   In fact, I don't know.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.360]   You probably can't even see this, but my doc, which by the way seems to be able to expand
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.360]   infinitely.
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.360]   I don't know.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360]   It's a point I guess I'll run.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:22.840]   But my doc, when it's in portrait mode, it's not terrible when it's in landscape mode.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.760]   But when it's in portrait mode, those touch targets are so small.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   What's the story?
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.120]   There's a really funny story for that.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.440]   So Steve Jobs did not want an iPad mini.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.440]   He thought it was dumb.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   He rallied against small tablets.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:37.680]   He's the guy who said you have to sharpen your fingers.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.480]   And then Eddy Q got the Galaxy tab and he's like, this is great.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.480]   We've got to make this.
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   And Tim's like, no, forget.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.480]   He's like, no, forget.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.680]   He's like, no, we really got to make this.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:46.040]   He's like, all right, fine.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.400]   The same as iTunes on Windows, it's your fault if it fails.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   So they made it.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.640]   And then the team was like, look, we just did an iPhone.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.640]   We just did an App Store.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.880]   We just did an iPad.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.280]   We do not have time to make another complete interface for something.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.360]   And someone said, well, why don't we just shrink it down?
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360]   What?
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360]   We shrink it down.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.720]   It'll be the exact same size as the iPhone.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.280]   We'll take the iPad interface.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.680]   It'll shrink down to the iPhone tab target size.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.920]   And we'll just ship it.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.360]   So they didn't bother to make a whole new interface.
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.720]   They just used the iPad interface at iPhone density.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.920]   Oh, that was interesting.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:20.280]   That wasn't itself brilliant because that meant that you don't have to spin up developers
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.280]   on here.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.520]   We need you to create new interfaces.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:27.080]   It's just also that was a selling point for me when I bought mine.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.240]   I think about the first generation.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.280]   And it was like, no, this will run all the apps that you enjoy on the iPad at the original
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.640]   scale, at the original size with no adaptations.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.640]   And so that was like, great.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:36.640]   Take it.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:37.640]   Done.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.320]   And yet iPhone apps aren't horrible on this.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.800]   I mean, there's clearly still iPhone apps.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.960]   You're like Instagram because there's no like that.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:45.960]   Just drives me nuts.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.920]   Can you make actual cell phone calls with it?
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.680]   If you have the cellular service, or is it always just--
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.920]   No, the cellular service is a data-only service.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:59.000]   So by the way, here's the Instagram app, which fills the screen nicely.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.680]   But you can tell it's an iPhone app, right?
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.720]   It just doesn't quite have that.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.480]   It breaks with every new iPhone because they hard-coded to every specific iPhone.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.200]   And now I think they're just terrified of trying to make of recoding it to make an iPad
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.200]   app.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.440]   And yet, this is consumable.
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.480]   I mean, it almost fills the screen.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.920]   It almost feels like it's an iPad app on the many.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.440]   It's only Apple had something called size classes it could use to make it automatically
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.800]   fit any device to be.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.800]   So I forgot what you--
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   What were you saying, Alex?
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.800]   I forgot.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.000]   I was just asking if you can make cell phone calls because I--
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   Oh, that's right.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.200]   This is a big question for me because I wanted to make this my phone.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.200]   Right.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.600]   Because I never pick up my phone.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.600]   I never do this.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.080]   I never put my phone up against my head, ever.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.080]   So you're--
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.080]   So Sim has a phone number.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.760]   That's how the all the carriers work.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   But it doesn't work as a phone through the SIM.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.480]   However, there are plenty of services that will do database phone calls.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.920]   Well, I do-- I use Apple--
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.400]   I said FaceTime all the time.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.000]   FaceTime Audio all the time.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.560]   Like literally, that is my primary way of calling anybody with a blue thing.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.040]   And everybody else I schedule time to meet on Zoom.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.520]   So I'm playing with ways.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.320]   Because what you really-- the one thing missing is a way to call a phone number, a landline
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.880]   from your mini.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.640]   And Google Voice will do that, Skype will do that.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.840]   There are plenty of programs that will do that.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840]   So I'm really tempted.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:22.400]   I guess my whole thing is that I can do something where I can make 90% of the calls, 95% of the
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.400]   calls that I would normally make.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.600]   And then I still have a phone for the things that need to do.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.040]   If you pay a little bit of money, you get a regular phone number with Skype, which I
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.040]   have.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.040]   Right.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.880]   And then this becomes the phone number of my mini.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.400]   So yes, I think the answer is an increasingly so.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.360]   Because LTE is voice over LTE now.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.520]   And everything's moving to data.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.520]   I think it increases.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.520]   Well, I found that--
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.520]   Well, I found that--
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.680]   I don't know what's happened with cell towers, whether it's the 5G or-- I don't know what
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:50.680]   it is.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.200]   But it's gotten a lot worse recently.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200]   And I actually find--
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.200]   It is?
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.200]   Are you Verizon?
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.040]   I'm both Verizon and AT&T and both are worse.
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.800]   Lisa is complaining about that, too.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.600]   She threw out-- I used T-Mobile.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.120]   She said, no, I'm not going to use it.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.440]   Verizon's so much better.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.520]   And now she's bitching because it's not so good at any--
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.720]   So I-- at my house, which used to work just fine.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.640]   My cell phone numbers or my cell phone calls are falling apart all the time.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.760]   And so I just decided to-- that's why-- that's what moved me to the Apple FaceTime audio
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.760]   was that I suddenly had nice clear calls.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.560]   And then I got so used to the quality of the FaceTime audio that I don't want to go back
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.560]   to the cell phone anytime.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.400]   And so now I'm just driving.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   And I just call with FaceTime audio unless I have to go to a cell number.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.440]   And so-- which I don't have to do very often.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.600]   So I don't talk to people on the phone that much.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:40.600]   I guess the big question-- and I haven't tried this-- is if I use Skype and my Skype
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:45.720]   phone number, will this ring and let-- won't I have to have Skype open?
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.040]   No, I don't think so.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.720]   I think if you have-- it has to be--
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.720]   It has to be backgrounded.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.720]   You can't kill it.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.720]   If you force quit it, you'll have to restart it.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.720]   But I think it'll go--
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.000]   Well, let's say if I didn't force quit it.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.120]   So it would work then, huh?
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.120]   I should try it.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.120]   It'll work like that.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   I have things calling all the time.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120]   Really?
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.120]   Signal.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120]   It's bugging you all.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.960]   Signal does it, right?
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.720]   What's app allows phone calls?
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.720]   Next time messenger.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.120]   The question is from a landline because we know if you can use FaceTime to anybody with
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:13.000]   an iPhone, and I know you don't have any friends who don't have iPhones.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   But if you have--
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.920]   I have friends that don't have iPhones.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.920]   I just don't talk to them on the phone.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.840]   I'm not going to call you.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.960]   It doesn't happen that-- I don't do it on purpose.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.600]   Let me try-- I don't know.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.200]   And I guess the do not disturb rules and everything are going to still apply.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.040]   Let me just try calling this.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:39.520]   So I guess we're back at 10 digits here.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.120]   I'm not going to give out this number because this is not one.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:54.000]   So if I close this and see if it'll ring, I'm calling it now for my phone.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.640]   I don't think it's ringing.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.800]   Maybe it takes a while to signal through.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.320]   I completely-- Apple should just put a phone app on it.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.320]   That's what they should do.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320]   No, they don't.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.320]   They don't.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.360]   They don't want you to buy this instead of an iPhone.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.240]   It's half the price of an iPhone.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.080]   Remember those photos with giant Android tablets with phone apps?
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.800]   They put it next to their head as a joke, but that's fantastic.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.400]   This doesn't look very different than the Surface Duo next to my--
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   No.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.400]   But it's a--
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.040]   By the way, no one talks on the phone like this anymore.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.040]   Have you noticed that?
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.920]   We were talking about this on Twig.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   Everybody talks like this.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920]   Well, I have AirPods.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920]   You don't have AirPods.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.880]   You don't have headphones or something.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.880]   You need wireless on my camera.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:37.760]   They're all in public and they're on speaker and they're very loud and it's very weird.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.240]   Yes, I'd love to say.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.160]   They wait till they get to the quiet car of the Amtrak train before they decide, "Hey,
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160]   hello."
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.960]   I'm hearing this argument with my boyfriend.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]   Mama.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   Mama.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:48.960]   Mama.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:49.960]   Mama.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:50.960]   M-a-m-me.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.880]   No, it's-- you're right.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.880]   I think that the pass-through of phone calls to the device is under-- the need for it is
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.200]   understated because I think all of us will say that getting an actual phone call is the
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.880]   least pleasant thing that we could ever do on our--
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.880]   Yeah, nobody wants that.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.160]   --because we live our lives to make.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.920]   But nonetheless, sometimes it really is the best solution to a problem, such as-- I
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.720]   don't have to tell people what app do you have or what's your account name on this.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.240]   It's like, no, here is a 10-digit number that seems to work.
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.160]   As a matter of fact, every time, because it turned out to get a connection-- a really
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.920]   good connection between my studio and WGBH studios in Boston.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.120]   The simplest and easiest solution was to simply have me set up a Skype phone number
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.840]   and they will call me from their switchboard, but it will still be like all Wi-Fi.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.920]   So it's not going to be as good as directly internet connection, but at least it's better.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.920]   And that was-- it was reliable.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.920]   It works every single week.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.480]   And there comes a point where it's like, which would you rather have a reliable connection
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.880]   that will always work?
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:53.480]   And when you call me two minutes before, I'm supposed to be taking up 20 to 25 minutes
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480]   of stroke time.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.800]   Or would you have something that's better-- better quality, but maybe it'll work, maybe
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   it won't.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.120]   Well, and I think that the other thing, though, is that because we get so much junk calls,
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.120]   you know, all these-- that I think that a lot of people like me, if I don't know what the
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.400]   number is, I never pick it up.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400]   Oh, no.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   Like, you know, I just never--
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   Can I put that-- you know.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.080]   Can I say that that's one thing where I really wish Apple would put more work into, because
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.680]   that's one area in which, like, a Pixel phone really shines, because I don't answer the
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.680]   phone.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.560]   Because my phone-- I'll hear it ring.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.000]   It will click to voicemail.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.120]   And instantly, I'm seeing a live transcript of what whoever this is saying.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.480]   And if it's all gibberish, I know that it's somebody speaking in Mandarin trying to sell
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.720]   me a phone card.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.440]   But if it's like, "Hi, Andy.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.960]   This is your cousin Phil."
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.400]   And burst pipe-- okay, hi, Phil.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.400]   What's going on?
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.400]   Hi.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.400]   Right.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.880]   And there's so many things you can do with the phone connection that would solve these
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.880]   problems.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.160]   And I think Apple is now well set up to make this as good a phone as it is at doing anything
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.560]   else instead of it being stuck into wherever they left it in, like, 2011.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.680]   There is continuity call relay that will let you answer regular phone calls on your iPad
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.360]   that route through your iPhone.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.840]   But I'm trying it now.
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.000]   And it's the same reliable the other way.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000]   Again, you know.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.160]   Again, if it's something where a hospital is going to call me, they're not going to text
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.480]   me, they're not going to IM me on this message.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.160]   They're going to try to call me to let me know about what's going on in a situation
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.160]   with a family member.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:21.680]   And that's where you absolutely want a phone call to go through.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.200]   If you were not to mistake it for a spam call and for everything to work with it, a phone
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.440]   call, you were raised to believe that a phone system should work without the billing problems.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.320]   We have to solve that by fixing the hospitals.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.280]   Not the phones.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.280]   Right.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.280]   They really could text message us.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   Since you've got one in hand, Renee, talk about the weight, the size, the appearance.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.160]   Groover said it feels kind of retro like a titanium.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.160]   It is so retro.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.160]   It's like a power book.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.680]   It's like a love letter to power books.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.080]   It's got that whole vibe about it.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.960]   It's even got this little artistic statement on the back.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.720]   They etch it in instead of--
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:04.920]   They also took the labeling off on the screen, which is great.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:08.000]   So it's just etched into the bottom now that says MacBook Pro.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.680]   They took away the-- yeah, and they gave you a notch, which like you-- it's kind of like
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.400]   in your face, but you stopped noticing it after a few minutes too.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.840]   But the screen is-- if you've seen the iPad Pro screen, the screen is ridiculously good
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840]   too.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:21.560]   It's like full HDR, really bright, really vibrant.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:26.040]   I keep forgetting to be-- I rate about the notch, I'm sorry.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.760]   I'll-- I guess I think what happens is just forget about the notch after a while and live
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:31.760]   with it.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.000]   The menu bar takes-- the menu bar leaves your screen and goes into the notch and you have
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.880]   like a normal sized MacBook screen without having the menu bought.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.880]   Honestly.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.880]   It's really nice.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.240]   The stuff I work with full screen, like e-max, probably, I'll see the notch because it's
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.320]   kind of there.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.880]   I'm using it full screen.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.000]   But I would gladly trade the notch for full size function keys and an escape key that
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000]   I can actually do.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.800]   Well, also, when you go full screen, you don't see the notch because it blacks out the top.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.680]   The top is out of the 16 by 9 window for full screen.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.080]   Some programs put stuff kind of in the middle there.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.080]   Oh, maybe.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.080]   It's all right.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.080]   I'll survive.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.080]   We'll get over it.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.080]   I'll get over it.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.080]   I wish you could pin notes under the notch.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.080]   Like, just let us pin our little notes under the notch.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080]   Then it'd be like a bulletin board.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.080]   It'd be great.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.640]   Do you notice that it's a little heavier?
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.640]   What is it?
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640]   Half a pound heavier?
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   It's like going back from baby Yoda to full size Yoda.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.400]   Like we used to have in 2050 and then previously.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:24.920]   But like, the 60-inch also, it's like 4.5, 4.something pounds, which is not insignificant.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.640]   But I think that's where you should differentiate.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.080]   Apple's one of the biggest issues with the previous pros is that Apple tried to make
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:35.840]   them like MacBook Pro Airs, which a lot of new generation, you know, I'm flying everywhere.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:36.840]   I'm a founder.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.840]   I'm a coder.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.680]   I'm going to use this thing on a Boeing 747.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.680]   They love that.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.680]   They bought that in droves.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.680]   But the people who were traditional pros are like, "No, no, no.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.680]   That's a MacBook Air.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.960]   I need an actual MacBook Pro."
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.520]   And that's what Apple's doing back here.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:52.120]   You know, they're not making the MacBook Pro have to be an Air anymore.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.120]   How's the sound?
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120]   It's amazing.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.720]   It's like the 16-inch MacBook Pro Intel model from 2019 was ridiculously good for a laptop.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:03.920]   Like I think industry leading still to this day.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.200]   And this is just a little bit better.
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.200]   Like they've just made every component a little bit better in it.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.800]   So it's like a little bit wider, a little bit more vibrant, a little bit better bass,
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.120]   a little brighter.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.640]   I was just, I was watching just like as a demo in Georgia came in.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:18.920]   That laptop, just thought I was watching it on the TV surround system.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.560]   It's really just loud.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.600]   And it really sounds like watching the Eternals trailer because I'm into that sort of thing.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.160]   And it sounds like you'll be fooled if you didn't know that it was a laptop.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:33.360]   dwindle has, as we've been talking, received his 16-inch and has opened it and booting
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.360]   it and I'm watching it in our chat rooms slowly go through the steps.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.200]   He says, "Oh, I can't wait to try the speakers."
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.320]   He's waiting for Mac OS update to finish.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.440]   You have an OS update immediately, huh?
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440]   You already have.
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.160]   It comes with a lot of Ray.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.840]   And I think Final Cut updated some of the components as well.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:55.320]   The Xcode 2, when it started.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.320]   What else?
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:03.920]   I'll ask a controversy with the HDMI and the SD cards because the HDMI is HDMI 2.0, not
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.600]   2.1 and the SD card is UHS 2, not 3.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.920]   Two is pretty fast, right?
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.280]   Yeah, except some people are like, "This is a Mac.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.680]   It's got out of the best of everything."
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:19.560]   But when you look at the schematic, it's got three Thunderbolt buses now, three USB buses
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.400]   up from two previously.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.400]   And there's just no bandwidth left.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.280]   They'd have to add another bus to get bandwidth to make.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:33.840]   The benefits are uncertain because HDMI 2.1 is great, but it's like 8K, 120 Hertz variable
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.680]   rate HDR grade and you're not outputting that.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:42.640]   The Mac can't output that right now, so it's a bit of a balancing act.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.160]   I think Renee is still pretty happy with his M1 Macs.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.160]   I'll speak for myself.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.920]   I know I am my M1 Pro.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.680]   I know I go to laptop, just an amazing device.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:58.680]   And as fun as this year was with Apple, I am very excited about the year to come.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:01.520]   I think next year's best of is going to be the best ever.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.280]   Meanwhile, keep tuning in Mac Break Weekly.

[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:35.020]   And I think we're almost 4,000 members of very, very special thanks to all of our Club
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:37.600]   Twit members.

[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.440]   When's our next episode, Mike?
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.920]   I think it's January 5th will be our next Mac Break Weekly.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:05.680]   I believe, or the second, or the fourth, the third.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.680]   No, the fifth.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.520]   No, it's January 4th, as Mark Callender says.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.680]   We will all be back live in studio.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.080]   I hope you are having a wonderful holiday season.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:18.720]   We wish you all the best.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.840]   We thank you so much for being with us through these tough couple of years.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:26.480]   And we look forward to a, I hope, much better 2022.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.480]   Happy new year, everybody.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.840]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.440]   Now, get back to celebrating, because break time is over.
