[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.440]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   Everything that's happening out of the little city
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.920]   of Cupertino, California.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.280]   Now here, joining us live in studio, Mr. Alex Lindsay of
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.080]   pixelcore.com.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.160]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.880]   Yes.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.480]   Yes.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.980]   Yes.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.880]   Yes.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.360]   Yes, it is me.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.040]   I am here.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.080]   I am here.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.640]   Also joining us right now, Mr. Frederick Van Johnson
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440]   from mediabytes.com.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.320]   Hello, ladies.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.720]   Oh, I've got a chill.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.840]   That just said us.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.520]   I had to go down and octave for that.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.720]   Hello, ladies.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.160]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, also with us
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   in his beautiful solarium, Mr. Andy Enothco.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.640]   I thought that this show would be in praise of the Earth goddess,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.680]   whose name oddly in our neighborhood as Carl.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.720]   Is that your backyard?
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.000]   That's beautiful out there.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.920]   That is the backyard.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.360]   If I had thought about this more than a half hour in advance,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.440]   I probably would have actually figured out how to get
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.200]   the lighting correctly so you can see the lovely greenery.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.800]   Well, the camera does it automatically.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   If you duck out of the way, the camera irises.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.040]   Well, just stay like that.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.600]   Stay.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.520]   Just do the show like that.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.400]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680]   There you go.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   What we need is we need to get you some--
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.120]   What the hell?
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.600]   You killed it.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.320]   Hello, ladies.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   That dog.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.080]   Buster.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.600]   Buster.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Ow.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   Ow.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Ow.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.040]   Oh, he's so plush.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.600]   I mean, it's an Andy some ND filter.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.320]   No, you know, I think--
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   Oh, for the witness.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.760]   It's all part of my plan.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.200]   If I keep sandbagging the auto quality, the video quality,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.560]   and you keep just correcting things for me,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.760]   I'll say you'll say, you know what?
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.520]   You just kept bouncing around in that chair.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.920]   We're going to send you like $1,000 desk chair.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.080]   You know, just to solve that problem.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.040]   I think you're right.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.440]   No, you actually look good.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440]   We did.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.400]   We sent out a HV40, a Canon camera,
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   and that really looks very nice.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.040]   A PR40.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280]   Everything we do has 40 in it.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.440]   And he's in the back 40.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.920]   Including what I'm drinking right now.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.000]   I bought that with myself.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.560]   Yeah, we didn't send you to 40.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.360]   But if you need it, we would have sent it out to you there.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   All right, it's time to talk about, well, what else?
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.560]   I almost don't even want to do it. The iPhone.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.920]   Still in the news.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.240]   I ain't bitter.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.600]   I'm in a case.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.880]   But this is the big story.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.480]   Today is a Consumer Reports.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.560]   Finally did the full test of iPhone.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.280]   Rated it very highly as a smartphone.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   In fact, if you just look at the numbers,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.320]   the highest rated smartphone in its rundown.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.720]   But did not give it their recommended badge because of antenna.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.800]   So they rated it the highest, but didn't recommend it.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.840]   So they think we should go back to Motorola--
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.960]   like a razor?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.440]   They probably-- I should look-- actually, I'm a subscriber.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.080]   I should just look and see what they recommended.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.800]   But it isn't the iPhone.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.480]   They said that they took it into their special room that
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.200]   is RF attenuated.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   So there's no signal from outside.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.480]   It's an RF quiet room.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.880]   And they have their own simulator that simulates reception.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.800]   And they said, yes, if you bridge that lower left-hand
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.480]   plastic bar, it does, in fact, yes, everybody's observed,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.520]   because I've observed, cut signal.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.280]   They said, if you're in a marginal signal area,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.720]   you will drop calls.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   And they said, this is independent of AT&T.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.360]   I think that's an important finding
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.960]   because they weren't using AT&T.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.160]   Here's the question I have, though,
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.360]   is it when it attenuates, when it goes down,
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.200]   is it worse than the 3GS?
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.800]   Or is it just--
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.760]   They said yes.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.360]   In fact, they recommended the 3GS.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.600]   What I was going to say is that my experience--
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.800]   I am in poor cell coverage at both at home and at work.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.200]   And I have found that I have to be much more careful with the 4
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.400]   than with the 3GS about where I'm standing
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   and what I'm doing with the phone.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.800]   I dropped two calls yesterday.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.920]   Was a nice feeling.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.840]   Because I have a case.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.760]   And I took the case off.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.680]   I thought, oh, I shouldn't really be doing it with the case
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   because it's not going to give me a reasonable sense
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.760]   of what the problems are.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.120]   And the minute I took the case, I dropped two calls.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.680]   But that's at home where I have a fairly weak signal.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.880]   I have gotten very good at holding it like this, though.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.760]   Hello.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.400]   Well, and Consumer Reports also said
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.440]   that it is not a software glitch that--
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.560]   but I don't think--
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.960]   I think that's a misreading a lot of people
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.520]   had of that Apple letter, which was that it was, oh,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.440]   we'll fix it in software.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   That's not what they were saying.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.680]   They just said, we're going to make the bars lower
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.400]   so you won't have the false expectation
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.240]   that you're not going to drop a call, something like that.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.720]   Your thoughts, Frederick and Ebeni--
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.360]   Well, you know what?
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.000]   First of all, I love my phone.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.240]   And I'm kind of happy that all this positivity is being
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.600]   cut with a little bit of negativity
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.840]   so people can stop bothering me about, hey,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.880]   how do you like your iPhone 4?
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   So I'm kind of happy with that.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.000]   Mine has this bumper on it.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   And for one, it makes it a little bit easier to handle,
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   so I'm happy with that.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.400]   And B, I've gone to--
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.040]   friend of mine, Mark Fucho, told me
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.760]   that he uses his phone mostly with the headphone jack plugged in.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040]   So he's always got the little blue headphones hanging out.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.400]   So I tried that.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.040]   And it's great.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.240]   So I'm listening to podcasts.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.840]   A call comes in.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   I hit the button.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.080]   The phone stays in my pocket.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.640]   So my workflow with the phone is not holding it in my left hand
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.880]   up to my head while I drive my stick shift.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.280]   Would I always feel like I'm cooking my brain when I do that?
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.680]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.560]   And also, I should point out that when you do that,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.320]   the proximity sensor, which is also screwed up,
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.080]   causes you to mute or dial, send dial tones,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   which are very annoying down the phone.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.800]   I've done that many times.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.680]   I've been on the phone.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.520]   I think it's your skin.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.680]   Mine doesn't do that at all.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.240]   Mine doesn't do that.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.520]   Apparently, it's not all iPhones.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.760]   It's a bug.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.560]   Does your Andy, any thoughts you've purchased?
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.960]   You actually purchased one.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.160]   Are you regretting it?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.280]   I mean, the simplest thing that I can say in response
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.520]   to all the problems, and a lot of them are really--
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.240]   are real problems, is that--
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.120]   I mean, Apple loaned me a couple of phones for my review,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.160]   but when I had and I bought my own, even though I knew
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.520]   that there was an antenna problem.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.240]   It doesn't really affect me, although I
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.400]   can reproduce it in certain places.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.880]   And what--
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.080]   When you say it doesn't affect you,
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.840]   you say it doesn't affect you because of how you use the phone
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.400]   or because you have good signal?
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.880]   Because I have good signal, like Frederick,
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.120]   I mean, I just prefer to have it in a bumper case anyway.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.760]   So that's a non-issue.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.600]   But I think the big deal is that consumer reports
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.640]   tend to be very, very Spock-like when they review anything
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.640]   for good or for ill.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.040]   They will go through a protocol and a bullet list,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.440]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.200]   And they tend not to end their test by looking at the device
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.560]   as a whole.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.320]   And the thing is, yes, there are a couple of real problems
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.280]   with this.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.320]   But the thing is, as a whole, there
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.080]   are so many improvements to the iPhone,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.320]   including signal reception, including GPS,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.360]   including data speeds.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.560]   And now we're going to talk about the camera or the screen
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.400]   that I just don't think that that should be a deal-breaking
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.680]   issue.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.440]   Again, put a case on it, which is something
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.080]   you really should do anyway.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.960]   And the problem goes away if you ever
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   were going to be having it to begin with.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.280]   When I have to admit, I'm getting a case for it,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.360]   not because of the reception, which I think is--
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.080]   I kind of like dropping calls as we talked about in the past.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.240]   But I want to put one on because I dropped my iPhone.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.920]   Fortunately, I dropped it on rubber at the house.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.960]   But I was like, this is glass on the back.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.480]   And a lot of people are going to drop them.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.520]   And there's a lot of drops that I've had with my iPhone,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.560]   my older iPhone, that would have broken, cracked, whatever.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.240]   So I'm putting this in a case, not because of the reception,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.160]   because I'm afraid of breaking the back.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.960]   I'll be honest.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   I was very worried about that when I saw the first design.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.640]   I'm really not worried about it right now.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.920]   I've seen enough drop tests.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.040]   And I've collected enough stories from other people
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.120]   that I don't believe that the iPhone 4 is any more fragile
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.320]   than the iPhone 3GS or anything forward.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.240]   I mean, even if you just go on YouTube,
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.400]   you can find videos of people doing just a static drop
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.720]   test on asphalt.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.600]   And they drop it once.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.320]   Nothing happens.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.960]   Drop it twice.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.600]   Nothing happens.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.760]   Drop it a third time.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.600]   It stops working.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.640]   Drop it a fourth time.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.560]   You actually get broken back.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.480]   The other interesting thing--
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.400]   unfortunately, I can't get--
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.280]   and I've gone through official channels and come up dry.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.840]   I can't get Apple to talk to me about any decisions that
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.640]   went into the selection of a glass back.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.960]   I was actively soliciting stories from people who had
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.160]   dropped and broken a phone.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.640]   I didn't say, did you break the back?
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.240]   I simply said, if you have dropped and broken a phone,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.280]   I want to hear from you.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.920]   I've heard from by now about 23 people, of whom only three
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.840]   have broken a screen.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.280]   All the rest have broken just the back piece.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.320]   So it makes me wonder if there is some--
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.160]   either a cork in the design or an intentional part of the design
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.640]   that says, if you've got to sacrifice one part of this
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   to a drop, how about we make the sacrifice be the cheap and
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.640]   easy to replace back?
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.000]   So I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.520]   But it's interesting that I'm having so many people tell me
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.920]   about broken backs as opposed to broken screens.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.000]   The back is apparently not the Gorilla Grass.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.480]   Gorilla Grass.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.320]   That they're--
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.480]   Gorilla Grass?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.080]   Gorilla Grass?
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.320]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.920]   So the front is different.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.400]   OK.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.320]   Thank you, Gorilla Grass.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.080]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.080]   Well done.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.200]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes from the Northern Bay.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   So he probably has access to certain things that we have never
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.300]   been able to--
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.340]   Oh, yeah, good ass.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.360]   So David, Hannah Meyer Hanson, the author of Ruby on Rails,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.960]   that somebody in the chatroom just tells me.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.240]   Thank you, Dr. Fislex.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.680]   That--
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.520]   I'm sorry, I can't help.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.480]   Giggle at your handle.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.400]   That David Hannah Meyer Hanson, who is in Danish US,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.960]   kind of bi-contrial.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.520]   Oh, yeah, this is going to be a bad show I could tell right now.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.880]   Says that it doesn't-- it affects him in the US
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.640]   and not in Denmark.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   So it could be the carrier.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.600]   In fact, I also have a link to--
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.840]   I mean, the mobile analyst--
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   Hold on, mobileanalyst.com/wordpressbob.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.000]   Egans--
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.800]   I'm sorry, mobileanst.wordpress.com.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.840]   Bob Egan's apparently an RF engineer.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.400]   He says, some reports did it all wrong.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.280]   So there's also some dissent about how consumer reports
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.240]   did the measurements.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.160]   Well, and I think the other thing--
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.440]   I did run that past a couple of radio engineers I talked to.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   They didn't necessarily tell me that their procedure was wrong,
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.960]   but that there is a valid radio test,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.360]   and then there is a test that you have to question.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.800]   If you want a really valid scientific test,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.720]   you have to remove every possible variable from the room
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.280]   so that you know exactly what's going on in there.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.680]   And they're not satisfied that they did a test that could
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.200]   really back up that claim that they did a scientific test.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.400]   They're not doubting the results.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.120]   They're simply saying that if you want to use this
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.440]   as a smoking scientific gun test, this isn't it.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.520]   Well, and I think also that this is exasperated
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.720]   by the fact that the AT&T network sucks.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   You're exasperated.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.440]   It's exacerbated.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:43.920]   Exhaspirated.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   Either way, it's exasperated.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.440]   It's respirated.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:56.320]   So according to Leander Kehaney in the cult of Mac blog,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.840]   he says he spoke to a number of PR experts,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.440]   including Chris Lahain, former Clinton White House
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.720]   master of disaster, the man who handled the PR problems
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.880]   in the White House when Clinton was president.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.640]   They agree Apple is going to have to do a recall.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.480]   Professor Matthew Seager, who is an expert in crisis
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.080]   communication, says Apple, "Apple will be forced
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.600]   to do a recall of this product.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.880]   It's critically important, and here's the important point,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.520]   and I think this might be a good point.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.400]   The brand image is the most important thing Apple has.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.320]   More important than any phone or the cost of recalling a phone
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.840]   is preserving their brand.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   Do you agree, Alex?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.600]   Well, I think that-- I don't think they need to do a recall.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.760]   I think that if I do think that Apple should say,
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.360]   if you have this problem and you want to fix it,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.040]   you can come into an Apple store and we'll give you a bumper.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.120]   They should give us a-- you know, they should at least give us
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.640]   a bumper.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.160]   No, no, the thing is, if that's really the issue,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.320]   I think that's all they have to do.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.360]   And these bumpers--
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.800]   Or this isn't like a Toyota gas pedal sticking issue.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.240]   Nobody's dying on here.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.560]   But they can just say, just come in and we'll give you a bumper.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.120]   If this is a problem for you-- number one, number one,
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.400]   if this is a problem for you, you've probably
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   had it for less than 30 days, you can just take it back.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.120]   If you really don't like this, just take it back.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.040]   But if you want to keep it--
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.440]   Are you satisfied with Apple's response to date?
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.360]   No, I think that they-- I think that Apple--
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.840]   I really think Apple should give away bumpers.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.480]   And then this would all go away, and it would cost them--
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.000]   here's the deal.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.720]   It's a lot cheaper than calling back the phone.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.000]   I don't think they need to call back the phone.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.560]   I think that a black bumper for all the phones
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   that they've released so far and all the ones
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.440]   that they're going to release is going to cost them $10 or $15
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.080]   million.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.880]   This is chump change to them.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.080]   And if they buy them that many, just think of that.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.200]   They're going to 30,000--
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.760]   Well, Hank, well, Hank said the half baked--
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.680]   probably did the word--
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.400]   I don't think the half baked response from Apple
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.040]   didn't do anything to solve the problem.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.240]   In fact, just raise the red flag so the Consumer Reports
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.480]   would investigate the problem.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.340]   So in other words, he's saying Apple did not handle it
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.080]   effectively.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.200]   Jandy, go ahead.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.080]   I'm just saying, I didn't like this story at all.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.880]   You're talking to PR people who have no intimacy with Apple.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.680]   So they don't know what the situation is.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   I saw--
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.000]   I know the credits for some of these guys, but at all of them.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.440]   And it's great that you work for the Clinton White House.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.160]   But those of us with long memories
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.400]   know that Bill Clinton had certain problems that Steve Jobs
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.200]   never had.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.760]   And yeah, I mean, the way getting this to Toyota or Bill
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.240]   Clinton is kind of far-fetched.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.480]   It's not that bad.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.560]   The big problem is that if they do a recall,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.040]   they are saying explicitly, we have a design flaw
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.720]   in our product.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.480]   We let something out there that should not have been released,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.880]   as opposed to simply saying, hey,
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.680]   you know how we always do a bug fix about a month or two
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.120]   months after the release of our product?
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.360]   We're doing that right now.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.960]   There's a free update going downloaded.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.200]   And also, oftentimes, we'll do a revision B of a motherboard
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.400]   because we found a better way of manufacturing something.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.200]   We're doing that, too.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.840]   The same thing that we do with every product
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.120]   that we develop.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   I don't know what Apple should be doing in this sort of circumstance.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.200]   But to say that they have to to protect the brand,
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.080]   that's just overreaching.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.800]   You agree, Frederick?
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.880]   You think this is not a big deal?
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.080]   You got a case?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.640]   Yeah, I got to say, I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.880]   And I agree with Alex.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.520]   I think giving out a bumper to all the people
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.240]   that are affected by this is probably the right thing,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.760]   except for the folks that already bought bumpers like me.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.720]   It's like 30 bucks, too, for that piece of rubber.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   It's outrageous.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   It's outrageous.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.520]   But the same price as the camera connection
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.760]   kit for the iPad for a little piece of plastic like this.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.400]   Here's what they should do.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.240]   Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   So it's working.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   Go ahead.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.920]   So I was going to say, yeah, I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.600]   I don't think it's brand damaging.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.680]   I think what was brand damaging was the response
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.120]   and the aloofness in the beginning.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.600]   I agree.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.200]   I think they have to be more aggressive now.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.760]   A different way.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.360]   We thrust upon you this bubble of a wonderful piece
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.720]   of technology.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.200]   Just hold it differently.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.440]   So that piece kind of rubbed me the wrong way.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.640]   But the phone itself, I think, is just crazy good.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.360]   And I don't think they need to recall it.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.480]   I think the bumper thing would probably solve it, or at least
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.800]   stick a cork in all this mess that's going on right now.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   And I don't think they needed to do the bumper at the beginning.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   But I do think this is the danger of Steve responding
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   to things.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   Don't let Steve--
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.440]   There's been a lot of things that people enjoy.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.320]   And I think it's been good for Apple in a lot of ways
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.560]   to have Steve responding to things.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.600]   But when he responds off the cuff,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.400]   this is what unwrapped this whole-- to him, it was just like--
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.200]   It's a folder different.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   And that became a problem.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.760]   I think for him, he spent an enormous amount of time
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.000]   producing an incredible piece of communications equipment.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.960]   And people are complaining about the reception,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.080]   which I'm sure he cares about very little.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.240]   And so I think he was just like, I know I would be.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.600]   I was like, I worked on all this stuff.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.800]   There's all these cool things.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.160]   And you're complaining about the bars going down
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.600]   a couple of points.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   And so I think of that.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Well, that's the problem because it
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.320]   isn't bars going down a couple of points.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.160]   Because if you hold the damn thing in your left hand,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.960]   you drop calls.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   That's not--
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.120]   That's not-- I mean, this is a phone.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.680]   I should be careful to say that I don't think
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.280]   that people are just whining about this.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.600]   I think that there are more problems associated
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.120]   with the iPhone 4 than we've seen in most other Apple products.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.040]   The question is, how best should Apple be responding to this?
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.960]   And it's weird-- see, the thing is
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.000]   they have a certain amount of latitude
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.240]   because they're going to be able to point to if they want
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.720]   to sort of say that this is a perfect phone.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.600]   They can point to millions and millions of people
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.640]   who are not experiencing these problems.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.720]   But that's never the reason why you withhold a phone.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.160]   It's because you found that one Toyota that does go off here
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.920]   and hit an inconvenient number of tour boats on the way down
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.720]   to the water that really gets bites in the bum.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.200]   That was the analogy I was going to give you.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.600]   Toyota could say, look, how many people haven't died?
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.880]   But that doesn't really solve the problem.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.560]   No, and again, this isn't-- this is not
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.720]   the same category of PR problems for--
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.560]   Paul Williams, first of all, it's not fatal.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.800]   In fact, you would be hard pressed to show damages.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.280]   Second of all, it doesn't happen to--
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.160]   I would say the vast majority of people.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.800]   And third, it's easily fixed by something that doesn't really
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.400]   change the phone.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.320]   In fact, Consumer Reports said you could put duct tape on it
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.640]   and that would fix it.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.680]   That would be--
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.480]   That's a typical Consumer Reports answer, by the way.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.560]   Alex's solution is good.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.840]   And if you're worried about people like us who
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.880]   are actually paying money for them, what Apple can do
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.000]   is they can keep the $30 bumper case as is.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.360]   The ones they give away for free will have, here you go,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.800]   you stupid whiner are you happening now?
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   I'm the side of it.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.640]   So if you're able to--
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.800]   I've for one who's welcome that.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.400]   I'd love to have that.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   You know what I think, though?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.960]   All this banter back and forth about, OK,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.760]   yeah, it drops calls from time to time.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.800]   You might have to put a case on a thing.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.040]   But if you take a step back and look at the technology
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.960]   that we have available to us in this thing
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.040]   and or in all these phones, these Android phones,
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.840]   everything, and you contrast that with what we had just five
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.200]   years ago with the Blackjack and all these other,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.440]   one to be phones out there, I heard somebody
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.680]   at the other day complaining that the iPhone 4 didn't
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   have an HDMI output on it.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.360]   I'm like, do you realize that you haven't your hands?
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.200]   I love that line.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.640]   You know, it'd be so great if it only had HDMI.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.160]   Like it's some sort of movie player.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.000]   Did you--
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Exactly.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.200]   You've seen the CK.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.320]   Let me read you a page for my grandfather
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.920]   as an immigration diary.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.800]   It's time he spent on a back of a goat down
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.520]   from the Italian Alps to get here to the country.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.920]   And then tell me that the lack of HDMI is a problem for you.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.520]   Thank you.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.760]   You saw the CK Lewis on--
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   I love CK Lewis.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.160]   Did you see him on the iPhone?
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.000]   No, no, talking about people complaining about technology.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Yeah, airplane flights.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   You see, it was like--
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.200]   It was like when you're talking about the phone,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.880]   you're like, just give it a second.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.320]   It's going to space.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.640]   Just give it a second.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   It's actually--
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.240]   It's a great--
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.600]   It is funny because it's true.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.800]   I mean, it's a great bit.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.880]   I think it's on YouTube.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.440]   It was-- he was on Conan O'Brien.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.560]   If you do a search for CK, it's really great.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.560]   I mean, that clip is--
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.360]   every time I think I'm going to complain about something,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.640]   about technology, I have to just watch that to re-center
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.360]   myself.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.160]   I'm just like, OK, let's get a grip that we're--
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.720]   It's definitely--
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.240]   Lewis CK is the name of the comic.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:58.960]   Oh, sorry, Lewis.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.160]   I always think of it as CK Lewis.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.440]   It's Lewis CK.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.640]   And he's got his own show coming out, I think.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.120]   But there's Conan O'Brien appearance was--
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.680]   I'll play a little bit of it because I'm sure this violates
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.720]   every tenet in the book.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.080]   We like to do that, you know.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.000]   It went good because when I read things like the foundations
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.600]   of capitalism are shattering, I'm like, maybe we need that.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.960]   Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.480]   with pots clanging on the sides.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.920]   You think that would just bring us back to reality?
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.880]   Yeah, because everything is amazing right now,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.280]   and nobody's happy.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.320]   Like, in my lifetime, the changes in the world
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.000]   have been incredible.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.160]   When I was a kid, we had a rotary phone.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.600]   We had a phone they got to stand next to.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.000]   And you have to dial it.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.720]   Yes.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.320]   You don't realize how primitive-- you're making sparks in a phone.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.160]   And you actually would hate people with zeros in their numbers
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.360]   because it was more--
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.880]   Oh, this guy's got two zeros through that guy.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   You're right away from him.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.080]   And then if they called and you weren't home,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.760]   the phone would just ring lonely by itself.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.960]   And then if you wanted money, you had to go in the bank
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.400]   for when it was open for like three hours.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.120]   It was stand-in-line, raise stuff and check like an idiot.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.960]   And then when you ran out of money, you'd just go, well,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.360]   I can't do any more things now.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.360]   I can't do any more things.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.840]   That's it.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.700]   That was it.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.440]   And even if you had a credit card,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.000]   they'd go, oh, can you bring out this whole shunk, shunk,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.880]   can you drink?
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.380]   Why do you have to call the president to see a joke?
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.380]   You called the president.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.940]   It was ridiculous.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.440]   Yes.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.260]   Do you feel that we now, in the 21st century,
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.500]   we take technology for granted?
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.220]   Well, yeah, because now we live in an amazing, amazing world.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.980]   And it's wasted on the crappiest generation of just--
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.260]   --the real idiots that don't care because this is what people
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.620]   like now.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.460]   They got their phone.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.060]   They're like, here it is.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.540]   [GRUNTS]
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.060]   It won't give it a second.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.420]   It's going to space.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.100]   I have to say, that's very apt.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.620]   And the--
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.140]   Thank you.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.700]   --and the Blue-Sckay.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.420]   That's exactly what was in my brain.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.820]   It's like, we just really-- we just really--
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.940]   we're spoiled bitches.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.380]   That's a strength-headed case.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.140]   I mean, there's a guy who shot--
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.540]   did you see the music video that was shot on the iPhone?
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.980]   There's a music video that was shot--
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.860]   --completely on the iPhone 4 that looks great.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.900]   Was it edited on the iPhone 2?
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.900]   No, it was edited on Final Cut.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.020]   But it was completely shot on the iPhone
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.140]   over a couple days or whatever.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.660]   And then shot--
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.940]   Do you think it's a good video?
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.940]   I mean, it's not--
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.740]   somebody was telling me it's not as good as the flip.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.540]   Was it you were saying that?
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.340]   I haven't tested it head-to-head with the flip yet.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.540]   Do you say it's not as good as the flip?
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.020]   That was Andy, I think, yeah.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.380]   No, it's not as good as the flip.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.140]   But it'll do.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.100]   But you got it.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.620]   You got it in your pocket.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.220]   And you have sort of a phone.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.820]   And a pretty darn good camera.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.260]   I have to say, I take a lot of pictures with it.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.420]   Frederick, you're the host of this week in photography.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.780]   This is a good camera.
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.780]   Now, you know what?
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.100]   This is a really good camera.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.780]   And it's a really good video device as well.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.700]   And I'll tell you, the thing that my phone can do that my,
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.540]   say, G9 or even my DSLR can't do is I can go sit in a cafe
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.260]   somewhere, edit my photos, and share them with the world
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.860]   right there.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.500]   And that's the big thing for me.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.540]   I don't care.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.940]   Yeah, it's an iPhone.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.980]   I'd be happy if my Nikon or my point and shoot
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.540]   could also have Wi-Fi and connect
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.900]   and allow me to edit and then upload directly from there.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.260]   But right now, it's all in the one device.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.220]   And that, for me, that's a game changer.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.660]   Now, no computer, no iPad, no anything.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.820]   It's just in my back pocket.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.180]   I can actually share images.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.940]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.100]   We're talking about not just the iPhone,
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.260]   but you know we haven't done it in ages?
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.860]   Let's talk about a Macintosh computer.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.620]   Is there anything to say at all about Macintosh computers
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.740]   today?
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:55.500]   I noticed this, I do a regular piece on a local news channel.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.460]   Every Tuesday morning, I talk about the tech news.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.740]   And for the last four weeks, it's been cell phones,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.460]   maybe a little Google, little Facebook.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.540]   The world has changed.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.780]   This show, when we first started doing it,
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.460]   was a computer show.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.900]   Yeah, these are the computers.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.340]   These are the computers.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.180]   This computer is--
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.060]   the computer, and this one, I don't know about this one,
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.820]   in my old iPhone, the computer was six times faster
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.060]   than what I rendered film shots for Star Wars.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.780]   What?
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.460]   No, I'm sorry, three times faster, three times faster
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.820]   than what I filmed on Star Wars.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.580]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.420]   So this one is about probably more than that, four or five
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.660]   times faster than what I--
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.980]   so these are--
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.580]   I mean, they may look like--
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.540]   They are computers.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.260]   But these are computers.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.700]   Oh.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.660]   I'm sorry to say that it does reflect the level of interest
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.580]   that Apple seems to be showing the Mac platform.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.660]   Yeah, that's true, absolutely.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.740]   I mean, it's kind of almost in the rest of Iran now.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.820]   At some point, I mean, I'm starting to get--
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.140]   I'm not bored yet with iOS, but I realized now,
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.180]   over the past few weeks, how edgy I am
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.300]   for announcements about macOS 11.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.740]   Not 10.7.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.140]   I'm waiting for macOS 11 now.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.300]   And you might be waiting a while, Andy.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.140]   I think that's going to be the one that's good.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.020]   I still think that's going to be the one that says--
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.460]   we're now releasing macOS 11 in open source.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:08.900]   Here.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   I really like that.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.420]   We're now releasing iOS X.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.380]   Like, oh, no.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.220]   I'm going to have to get a screen cleaner for my MacBook now.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.220]   Oh.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.420]   I think open source OS X would be the best thing that ever
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.540]   happened to professionals like me,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.940]   because it means that we keep by whatever hardware we want
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.220]   and put the OS X on it.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.700]   And we wouldn't--
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.300]   We should just start this campaign now.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.260]   Yeah, I mean, that's--
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.220]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.220]   No, no, no, no.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.220]   No, no, no, no.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.500]   It will never happen, and it never should happen.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.460]   The worst thing that can happen to a consumer grade anything
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.260]   is to open source the entire thing
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.100]   and trust the developer community,
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.660]   not just to-- they're very good technically as a community,
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.580]   but in terms of direction and figuring out exactly what
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.180]   consumers want.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.300]   I love Ubuntu.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.940]   I use Ubuntu, but my house is free of Ubuntu.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.620]   But if it's open source operating systems,
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.140]   I actually want to use on a daily basis.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.220]   Now, what if one was blessed by Apple, though?
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.940]   A version of it, a version in hardware that's blessed by Apple
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.780]   and the rest of it you can do whatever you want with.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.100]   So the idea is if you want it safe and you want to be a consumer,
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.660]   you can have it be--
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.700]   That's perfect ways, though.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.500]   The thing is Apple just says, we approve this version of the OS
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.060]   and we approve these pieces of hardware.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.580]   You people can submit it to be blessed by Apple.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.100]   And if you want to take it on your own,
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.860]   you want to go down and put it on whatever crazy hardware you want
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.100]   and do whatever crazy thing you want to do the OS,
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.420]   you can, because Apple's done with it.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.380]   I think the bottom line is that within--
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.900]   I still think within five years, Apple's
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.580]   going to be done with OS 10.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.580]   They're going to be done with non-IO.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.100]   So the question is, what are they going to do with it?
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.500]   And I think that giving us professionals control--
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.020]   I mean, a lot of people use Linux--
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.620]   because I think that for a consumer, I don't think it matters.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.020]   I think consumers are using iPads and iPhones.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.060]   When I look at what consumers do with their hardware,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.420]   that's all they're going to use.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.100]   And the professionals are the ones that
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.660]   want to tweak it all the way out.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.700]   Because I don't think--
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.180]   Well, I think you gain an advantage, too,
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.780]   when you open it to a community that you get a chance
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.660]   to have stuff developed.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.740]   Here's the deal.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.260]   You would develop new stuff for it.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.940]   I want to build a hardware keyer.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.580]   We build keying software.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.380]   What am I going to build that hardware keyer in?
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.140]   Linux.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.220]   Why am I going to do that?
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.700]   Really?
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.140]   Because I need to build a piece of hardware.
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.380]   And then I need to connect it all.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.260]   And I guess I could try to gut a Mac Mini or a gut something
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:16.760]   out.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.500]   But if I want to build something to the size
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.060]   that I wanted to build it in with the components that I want,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.580]   I have to use Linux to do that.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.300]   And the thing is, if OS 10 was open source,
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.580]   I could use OS 10 and just add the little bits that I need,
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.220]   or just be the fact that I can install it on a PC platform
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.780]   without needing that extra chip.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.740]   But that's the issue.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.540]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.500]   Sounds amazing with Andy.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.580]   Sorry, go ahead, Andy.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.420]   I was just going to say, as long as you're making wishes,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.540]   why don't you wish that Apple will build that thing for you
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.620]   and give it to you for free?
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.620]   They won't, though.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.620]   They're not interested.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.140]   It's a truck.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.580]   They're also not interested in open sourcing the OS.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.860]   I mean, it just doesn't play into any of their interests.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.260]   From a financial point of view.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.700]   Well, it's a good idea.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.300]   They would correctly say that, well, if you like open source
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.300]   that much, Linuxes are really, really wonderful.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.540]   They're completely open.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.900]   There's hardware specifications, where
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.540]   if you want to build your own motherboard, you can do that.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.740]   I mean, I don't know what this--
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.220]   I just don't see the advantage to not only Apple,
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.620]   but also the Apple community.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.700]   I have a completely open source version of the Mac OS.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.740]   I think the advantage is it would take a lot of worry
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.940]   off of people who--
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.980]   I mean, Apple is done with OS 10.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.380]   I mean, the thing is, it's going to draw out,
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.060]   and they're going to be done with it in the next five
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.180]   to 10 years.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.460]   They're not going to develop it.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.300]   They're also going to be done with iOS in the next five
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.700]   or 10 years.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.140]   That's a hell of a long time.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.020]   Yeah, five or 10 years.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.500]   Who knows?
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.900]   Who'll be in space, right?
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   Well, I mean, but the thing is, is that within the next five
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.100]   years, they're going to be done with OS 10, I think.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.940]   And I think--
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.140]   No, they want to OS 11.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.660]   What?
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.460]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.460]   They're not going to build these.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.460]   They're not going to build these.
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.140]   They're not building.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:41.740]   They're not building.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.860]   I don't think you need to know--
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.820]   well, OK, this is such a good conversation.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.860]   I do want to take a break.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.380]   We'll come back.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.940]   I want to follow up on this conversation.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.380]   Do we need to know, OS 11?
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.700]   And what would an OS 11 look like?
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.100]   I mean, that's an interesting question,
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.900]   in and of itself.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.380]   Before we do that, though, I do want to mention our friends
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.300]   at Gazelle.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.140]   I know there are people getting new iPhones.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.500]   In fact, I know you say I'm going to conundrum right now.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.660]   I have a cognitive dissonance because I have a 3GS,
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.220]   and I look at it, and it's beautiful.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.180]   And I think, oh, I can get a lot of money from it from Gazelle.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.420]   But I don't know if I want to keep it.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.900]   And I never had that problem before.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.420]   I just keep everything and run it into the ground.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.860]   But now that this is Gazelle's out--
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.580]   I'm like, I could make some money with it.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.180]   So the deal is, if you go to gazelle.com/iPhone--
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.660]   now, sometimes I get notes from people saying, hey,
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.620]   Gazelle said they'd give me $200 from my iPhone.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.140]   And when I send it to them, they said
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.860]   the cracked screen would lower the amount of money they'd give.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.540]   You've got to be honest about the condition of the phone.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.620]   You're not going to get--
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.060]   but if you want it, but this really works.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.020]   We've done it a number of times.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.940]   I've done it.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.860]   Lisa sent a whole box back to Gazelle.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.580]   Here's the deal with Gazelle.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.860]   Gazelle is the easy way to sell or recycle the used gadgets
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.260]   lying around your home or office.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.820]   You collect your gadgets.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.780]   You send them to Gazelle.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.220]   They send you money.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.820]   I mean, what could be bad with that?
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.220]   So if you go to gazelle.com/iPhone right now,
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.740]   this is for people who say, I've got a 3GS or 3G,
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.380]   or even the original iPhone.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.900]   And you want to trade it in so you can get the iPhone 4.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.580]   Select your model, and it starts all the way at iPhone 2G.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.780]   I guess that's not really the name,
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.980]   but that's what they're calling it, 4GB out of the way up to.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.020]   You could sell your iPhone 4.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.500]   Actually--
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.260]   What'd you get to your iPhone 4?
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.660]   A 32GB iPhone 4.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.540]   And now, then you, of course, have to say,
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.300]   does it make a call successfully?
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.580]   [GROANING]
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.220]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure it does.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.460]   Rate the overall condition.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:30.940]   Perfect.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.900]   Get the shout out a little bit to hear across the room.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.700]   AC adapter, original cables.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.420]   I got everything.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.740]   In other words, perfect condition.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.380]   It's in the box.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.260]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.820]   $493.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.100]   It's worth--
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.140]   I don't know.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.460]   So that's an interesting--
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.580]   I got one in the box.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.900]   I just got yesterday.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.220]   The people who ordered done day two
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.260]   are now getting their iPhones--
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:52.940]   their iPhone 4.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.380]   No.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.020]   So anyway, here's the idea.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.700]   You call them.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.060]   In many cases, they will send you a box
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.020]   that you fill up with not just your iPhone, any kind of gadget.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.180]   Your smartphones, MP3 players, e-book readers,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.940]   laptops, cameras, gaming consoles, GPS devices, video games,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   whatever.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.380]   Now, either they will give you cash
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.740]   if the gadgets are worth anything.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.740]   And they'll tell you how much that they plan to give you.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.260]   Of course, that's pending their inspection of it.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.140]   By the way, they delete all data routinely.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.060]   So that's nice.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.180]   I mean, they're not going to mess--
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.700]   That's the case you didn't.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.420]   But you should.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.500]   You should, of course.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.860]   But a lot of times people go, how do I get rid of the data
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.300]   on here?
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.340]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.340]   So they'll do that.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.500]   They, of course, do it.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.940]   And if it's not worth anything-- and a lot of really old stuff
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.580]   isn't-- they will help you recycle it responsibly.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.660]   And I really like this part of Gazelle.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.620]   They use, in the US, recyclers--
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.940]   no export, no landfill, no use of prison labor.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.380]   All their recycling partners are recognized by the EPA.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.140]   They have a documented environmental management system
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   independently audited.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.500]   Right now, they're using Cloud Blue,
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.900]   but they have other great domestic recyclers that
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.260]   are all band certified.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.540]   And that's key.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.940]   So you're not sending this to China for child labor
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.060]   to dismantle.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.220]   So also a great way to recycle.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.140]   I think we talk about Gazelle as selling stuff,
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.860]   but a great way to recycle too.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:23.940]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com slash iPhone is time to upgrade
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.220]   and get the most money you can.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.980]   In most cases, my experience has been,
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.500]   you'll get at least your $200 back.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.860]   And the time to do it is now.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.220]   I mean, it's not going to get better.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.500]   Oh, well, that's the other thing I love this.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.780]   I'll show you a graph whenever you enter in of the value
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.900]   as it's--
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:44.180]   and already, today, the iPhone 4 is at its maximum average price.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.060]   But they predict by August it'll be worth $100,
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.980]   and then they're $50 by October 10, 170 bucks less.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.300]   This is like a depressing version of things.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.500]   It's like, sell it now if you're going to sell it.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.820]   I love this company.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.500]   They're really great.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   If you have a nonprofit, check out their nonprofit pages
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.860]   as well.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.340]   They'll make a page for your nonprofit.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.020]   Like a bake sale only, you say to all your families
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.460]   in the soccer team or whatever.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.660]   Send your gadgets to Gazelle.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.300]   We get the money.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.860]   I think that's such a great thing.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.580]   G-A-Z-E-L-E. Gazelle.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.220]   Don't sell it.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.020]   Gazelle at gazelle.com slash iPhone.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.620]   So OS 11.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.100]   And do you keep saying OS 11?
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.980]   Do you know anything?
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.220]   I don't know anything specifically.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.380]   When I say OS 11, I don't mean the next version to the OS.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.460]   I mean something that is radically different from OS 10
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.420]   as OS 10 was from OS 9.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:34.940]   Right.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.500]   The moment where Apple says that we always
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.020]   knew that we're going to get the iPod off of its feet
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.380]   and bring its OS to the forefront of the mobile experience,
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.380]   that's done.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.540]   We're still working on it.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.620]   But we feel as though we've got the walls up,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.940]   we've got the roof on.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.940]   And it's ready to go in and of itself.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.620]   Now it's time for us to start looking back at Mac OS
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.380]   and see things that we need to be doing there.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.380]   And I don't really think that we'll always
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.860]   will ever see the loss of the desktop version
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.380]   of Apple operating systems.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.740]   I think they're going to get a lot closer
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.380]   to each other between the desktop and the mobile version.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.020]   I don't want to think it would be ridiculous
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.420]   to have the exact same operating system.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.060]   Excessor, they're just being articulated differently
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.900]   on both platforms.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.260]   Actually, that's sort of what we have right now,
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.980]   because people forget that at the core of the iPhone
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.220]   operating system or iOS is still OS 10.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.460]   So but really, the idea that Apple will ever get out
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.580]   of the desktops.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.620]   It's like it's a relationship with customers
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.980]   that will always be good for Apple.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.500]   Always be making a lot more money.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.380]   We'll never be getting the design awards.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.980]   And we'll never be getting the sort of people with lines
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.460]   up around the block to purchase a DVD
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.460]   and a black folder.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.820]   But I'm really impatient to see the next version.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.180]   And I know that Apple's probably at least marginally
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.700]   as impatient as I am to figure out what the next job is
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.340]   going to be.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.780]   Web 1297 in a chatroom actually makes a salient point.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.580]   He said, "No mention at the WWDC of even 10.7."
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.420]   I mean, this is not on Apple's radar, apparently.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.700]   Well, I think the other thing is, I think,
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.700]   when you think about some of the advantages for Apple
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.860]   of open sourcing, something like this, or licensing it.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.980]   But especially if I could drop this and I love you for it.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.820]   I'm not going to drop it.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.660]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.420]   It's because you take--
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.140]   Apple is taking a lot of ground with the iPhone
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.780]   on the iPad.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.820]   You combine this with an open source version of OS 10,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.060]   and it destroys the Windows and Linux market.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:30.060]   I mean, it would chew the Linux and Windows market
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.620]   into small little pieces.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.860]   Well, it's based on--
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   The BSD.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.180]   It's based on-- Darwin is an open source.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.180]   I mean, everything's open source.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.780]   It's just the top part, the Aqua, and all that quick time,
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.180]   which is kind of the family jewels.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.220]   You got to be careful because so much of what is in iOS 4--
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.140]   Yeah, but they strip quick time into nothing.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.020]   I mean, quick time is just a video player now.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.700]   It's all the stuff that was good about that.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.380]   I know.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.300]   I am bitter about it.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.180]   So the thing is, but I think that this
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.660]   is part of what they're doing is that they are not
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.220]   interested in trucks anymore.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.860]   They are a car company.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.780]   And they're selling cars.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.740]   And I think that they're really--
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.500]   I think they're done.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.340]   I think that--
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.340]   I love my computer.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.260]   I'm curious about Alex.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.780]   What we haven't mentioned is the whole cloud piece of this.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.460]   And I've heard rumors of--
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.780]   we all know Apple's building out the big data center.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.260]   That's where Microsoft's going.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.500]   Microsoft seems to be going to the cloud.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.380]   Is it going to be woven into this macOS 11
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.300]   over this hybrid of macOS 11 in iOS?
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.140]   Or how is it all going to play out?
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.500]   And I just think that there is a limited supply
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   of great engineers.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.860]   And I think that Apple is going to keep on taking their best
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   engineers and pushing them towards the iPhone, pulling them
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.500]   out of OS 10.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.660]   I think they may be forced to--
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.820]   And pushing them into continuing to develop that platform.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.740]   Because this is the place where Apple can own 80%.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.980]   Apple's got a good reason to get rid of the desktop
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.820]   or to damage the desktop market.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.780]   And that is because they lost that battle.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.860]   They have 10% or 15%.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.380]   They could have 80%.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.300]   But it's going to take all of Steve's focus, all
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.420]   of their management focus, and all of their engineering focus
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.460]   to make sure that they stay in front of Android,
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.860]   in front of those other things.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.180]   And I just think that--
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.700]   And I think that the branding damage that would be done
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.860]   if they just killed the OS would be devastating.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.140]   And so I think that the easiest way for Apple
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.220]   to wring its hands of something that they
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.100]   don't want to focus on anymore would be to either license it
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.500]   or to open source it.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.620]   But not until it's a small percentage of their income,
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.340]   which isn't not yet.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.620]   But I absolutely disagree with the premise
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.580]   that a desktop OS is not something
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.220]   that Apple is interested in.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.620]   I think that I still require it.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.540]   Well, they still require it, right?
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.220]   You can't develop without it.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.220]   You can't activate an iPhone with it.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.140]   I think that Apple doesn't have the slightest interest in owning
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.540]   80% of the desktop market.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.140]   I think that they found the way to succeed with desktops.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.140]   That they're not going to-- if they never
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.500]   amount to more than 10% of the desktop market, ever, that's fine.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.580]   I think that's a smart role, too, because what we tend to ignore
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.100]   is that everybody who is in this conversation--
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.700]   I think that most of the people who are listening to us
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.900]   right now are people who really care
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.580]   about the tools that they use.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.740]   We chose Macs, released initially,
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.540]   because it was better than anything else out there.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.980]   And we had specific needs and specific desires
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.220]   for our hardware and for our software.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.260]   But I think that 80% of the market
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.780]   does represent the people for whom I don't care.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.580]   I want a computer that turns on, let's me word process,
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.580]   doesn't get it my way until I can leave my office and go home
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.580]   and forget I even have to deal with computers ever.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.700]   I don't think you're ever going to win those people over
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.540]   with Mac OS.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.900]   Well, no, I think that-- I don't think they want 80%.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.540]   I don't think Apple wants 80% of the desktop.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.900]   I think they want 80% of the iPhone/IPAD, whatever
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.660]   market you call that.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.060]   I think they've just given up on the desktop.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.860]   I think Apple's going to go where the money is.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.100]   That's what they're doing, right?
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.620]   And there's lots of money in the desktop, too.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.460]   Is there for the moment?
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.980]   But what percentage of profits does mobile computing now
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.300]   represent for Apple?
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.940]   It's got to be more than half now, right?
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:56.420]   I think it's--
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.900]   Well, they sold more IPAD, iPhone and IPAD.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.700]   I think they sold more IPads than computers on the last quarter.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.220]   I'm not 100% sure of that.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.660]   So I think that it's-- and I'm just looking at also
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.660]   how I use the computer.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:13.300]   I used to be-- I used to be ambitically attached to my laptop.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.460]   I mean, I just never went anywhere without it.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.340]   And now I'm noticing how much I use my IPAD.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.420]   Maybe not the best test case, because we
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.820]   are all-- we all come from that generation
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.140]   that we wanted a computer.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.540]   And maybe that's not the test case.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.180]   I'm looking at your kid Malachi, who is what, three?
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.140]   He's two and a half.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.220]   He knows more IPAD users.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   He's an IPAD user.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.620]   Oh, he just gets up in the morning and got bedhead.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.420]   And he's like, IPAD?
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.180]   And he's not interested in my computer.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.340]   He's interested in the IPAD.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.860]   And when you look at my-- our parents are--
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.660]   It's not that that's not a computer.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.220]   We're not saying that that's not a computer.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.060]   In fact, you were very clear.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:45.860]   This is a computer.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   It's a different form factor.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.260]   It's a different operating system.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.620]   And most importantly, it's a different UI.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.700]   And I think that I think for 80% of the population
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.820]   within the next five years, 80% of the population
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.140]   will not need anything more than an IPAD.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.100]   Maybe with some-- obviously some advancements
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.460]   in how it operates.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.020]   But they're not going to need anything more, 80 to 90%.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.740]   And there's only going to be 10% or 20% left that really
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.740]   need a desktop, really need a laptop.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.820]   I only use it because I do video and stuff like that.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.620]   Sometimes I think that the IPAD is a natural progression
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.340]   in the word personal of personal computer.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.260]   As they get more and more personal, more and more intimate,
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.060]   they are more and more beloved in some ways.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.300]   And so I think Steve's describing it as a truck
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.620]   is a little bit off the point.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.780]   It's not its utility that we're talking about.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.460]   It's connectivity to us in the outside world.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.500]   It's good that Apple is making consumer-grade computers.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.620]   And desktop computers generally decide
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.260]   and thought of as consumer electronics.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.180]   There's not anymore.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:42.980]   But not anymore.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.180]   But again, we can't really get television about this.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.220]   Think about the idea of building of your tasks for this month
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.820]   is to build a company report.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.020]   And you have to write this 50 page document that
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.820]   incorporates spreadsheets, actuarial data, media
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.700]   from five different sources from 10 different field offices
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.900]   that all have to be collaborated upon, collated, digested,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.460]   spit out, designed, step, step, step, step, step.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.780]   That is a sort of task that don't give me a million dollars
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.820]   to put an iPad and tell me that I can do this on an iPad
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.380]   or a device that's like that.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.860]   I need big screen.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:18.620]   I need keyboard.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.420]   I need mouse.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.940]   I don't even think that's generational.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.460]   I think there will always be tasks.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.340]   There'll be implicitly more necessary to use
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.740]   on a desktop or even a notebook.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.900]   I'm a writer.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.060]   I mean, really, my needs for computing hardware
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.860]   and for complexity of projects are really pretty slow.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.500]   I do my research on a web browser.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.460]   I put numbers into spreadsheets.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.900]   But in the end, the products that I'm making
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.460]   and the thing that I'm working in is just text.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.020]   In theory, I should be able to get by on an iPad just fine.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.700]   But any time I got to do any real--
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.100]   the only times I've ever done a production level work
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.380]   on my iPad start to finish are when
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.300]   I was doing that to make a point or where going home to my computer
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.460]   was going to be inconvenient.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.300]   I thought, well, you know what?
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.220]   I got 90 minutes.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.740]   Let's just knock off this 600 word piece.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.540]   All right.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.980]   If you're not winning over me, I'm not sure if you're
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.580]   going to win over anybody.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.340]   I want to vote.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.820]   I'm going to ask each of you.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.580]   What is the issue?
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.980]   Is Steve distracted right now but where all the money is?
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.700]   Or is Apple actively moving away from the truck?
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.020]   I think Apple's moving away from the truck.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.780]   Frederick?
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:21.340]   I agree.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.340]   I think it's both.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.020]   I mean, you're distracted because there's
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.220]   a big bag of money over there.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.700]   And that's where the crowd and all the mind share is
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.780]   is on the mobile devices.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.180]   And that's where my mind is.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.380]   But on that same note, Alex, I have to disagree with you.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.740]   I don't want to give up the fit and finish of my Mac,
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.540]   you know, and the attention to detail that Apple--
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.020]   But I think, Alex, said-- and I think he's right--
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.780]   that you still have an approved version that
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.860]   is polished in this Apple.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.780]   He's going to fragment.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.500]   It would fragment.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.460]   It would fragment.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.780]   But you'd have one version that is--
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.460]   there's companies that make it--
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.300]   Apple produces a spec and people make it to that spec
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.460]   and that one's approved.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.060]   And the rest of them, people can go crazy
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.500]   because there's a lot of people that
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.940]   would love to go crazy, would leave Windows and Linux
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.860]   if they could have OS 10, but then
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.820]   be able to design their board and design their stuff
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.420]   and go down the path of having a higher risk.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.500]   But when I think of like Final Cut users
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.820]   or visual effects producers or people who need trucks,
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.500]   I mean, people who are doing video, who are doing--
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.300]   What does Apple gain out of this?
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.620]   I mean, does Apple gain anything out of OS?
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.180]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.820]   Well, I think they destroy the desktop market that's left.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.860]   I mean, well, the thing is that they would--
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.420]   I mean, if they would--
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.820]   Do you disagree, Annie?
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.580]   No, I mean, to answer your original question,
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.380]   I think that Apple has three children.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.620]   They have the Macintosh that's 25 years old
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.900]   and it's on its own.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.380]   It has Mac OS 10 that is 10 years old and pretty self-sufficient.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.500]   And right now, they're paying attention to the 2 and 1/2,
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.020]   the three-year-old that's still barely learning
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.460]   how to walk and feed itself.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.460]   I think that's why it's getting most of the attention
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.540]   on most of the engineering right now,
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.380]   because you have something that is,
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.620]   in anthropological terms and family terms,
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.900]   can barely protect itself from rabid dogs.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.460]   I do think that the reason why that they're ignoring--
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.540]   there seem to be ignoring Mac OS right now is because it's stable.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.780]   It has its own momentum behind it.
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.580]   And it's not a machine that--
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.940]   they release a new version of the OS
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.620]   and all of a sudden it can't get--
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.260]   when people hold their keyboards wrong
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.780]   and they can't get access to the internet.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.420]   That's the level that we're at still with iOS.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.900]   It sounds like Alex-- it sounds like it would be analogous to
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.100]   Steve Jobs having a party in his house
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.780]   and courting off one room for all the VIPs.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.380]   You want my Steve Jobs experience,
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.740]   you come over into this room,
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.820]   but all you other people have at it.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.460]   Yeah, but it's the opposite though.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.980]   It is him saying that we're going to work for what 80 to 90%
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.060]   of the population is really going to use.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.860]   And the other part we're not going to focus on.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:39.940]   And I just don't think--
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.700]   I think that many stories that we hear coming out of Apple
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.980]   is the one thing about Steve is that he has laser focus.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.100]   You know, that he decides where he's going to go next.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.460]   And once he's given up on something,
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.780]   getting him to go back is unlikely.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.860]   And so the thing is, is that I just don't think if the iPad
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.340]   and iPhone stumble, I could see them coming back to it.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.980]   But if the iPad and the iPhone continue to expand,
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.380]   I think that they'll gut the engineering teams.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.660]   I think they'll gut the marketing teams.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.980]   I think that they'll just keep on moving down that path
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.340]   because I think that that is the open field.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.540]   You know, that's where they're going to have their biggest
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:14.900]   growth.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.340]   Here's the thing you're forgetting
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.660]   that the Mac OS is next OS.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:20.860]   That's something that Steve brought with him personally
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:21.780]   from his previous stuff.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.580]   I just don't think he cares.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.140]   I don't-- maybe if he doesn't care,
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.220]   he doesn't-- he does have that laser focus.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   I've heard the same-- probably the same sort of stories
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.540]   that you have.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.580]   But until he is actively interested in killing
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.260]   the desktop OS, I think the desktop OS is going to work just
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:37.780]   fine.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.980]   The company is not Steve just because Steve does not--
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.940]   if we're guessing that he does not--
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.020]   that's not his most interesting part of the company
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.060]   right now, just because that's not his focus right now,
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.900]   if that's true.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.380]   That doesn't mean that it's just going to be gutted
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.500]   and people are going to start stealing office chairs
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.300]   from that part of the thing.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.260]   No, I agree.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:55.900]   I think--
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.060]   I think the clear answer is, yes, Apple is distracted.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.940]   Apple has historically never had a problem cutting off dead limbs.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.820]   This is one of the things that's in the strength of Apple
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.340]   is they're very happy to do that,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.340]   even though there's a lot of anguish when it happens.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.500]   I don't know if the OS 10 is a dead limb.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.820]   I don't think it is yet.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.180]   But I think Andy's got a kind of the right idea,
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.740]   which is you let it go.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.940]   It's still-- sales are still up on Mac computers.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.500]   You continue to make it.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.980]   I don't think you see OS 11.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.060]   I don't think you innovate on that platform anymore, Andy.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.740]   I think you just let it go the way it is.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.500]   I doubt Apple ever opensource it.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.460]   I think that's not--
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.180]   I think if it's not called OS 11, it'll
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.500]   be called something brand new.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.380]   I think they will do a new version of the OS, a major revision.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:41.140]   I think it'll be brought so that your iOS devices
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.460]   and your desktop devices have a greater level of intimacy
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.300]   between each other.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.140]   And the experience is a lot more seamless between going
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.780]   from the desktop to going to the iPad or going to the iPhone.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:57.860]   But I really don't think that the desktop OS is now
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.700]   on just flat level trajectory right now.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.420]   It's still going to continue to move forward.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.260]   And for another reason, just to maintain it
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.180]   as a point of pride.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:04.940]   And I think the problem--
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.180]   I think the problem of the thing I've tried
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.820]   is exactly what Apple does not do.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.820]   And if you look at what they did to iMovie,
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.140]   if you look at what they did to QuickTime--
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.140]   If they look at QuickTime--
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.220]   They'll tear it apart.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:13.860]   They'll gut it.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.580]   I don't think they have any problem doing that.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.180]   I think for one thing, we have to recognize
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.500]   Steve Jobs is not going to be there that much longer.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.420]   Well, and I think that the other thing is, again,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.300]   when you look at what Apple could do to the desktop market,
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.180]   could do to their competitors by making an open source for a business.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.060]   I don't think the desktop market matters anymore.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:30.860]   I think it's over.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.180]   It doesn't matter, but there's still people
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.220]   making a lot of money with it.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:33.860]   Yeah, Apple.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:34.700]   Apple, for one.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.900]   Well, but I'm saying that you could--
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.460]   They would get the last laugh on the desktop if they made it.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.580]   I don't even know where you go with an OS 11.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.340]   I guess that was the question I was going to post to you.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.860]   Maybe we'll do that in a second.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.580]   I think it's stable and you stick there.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.780]   But maybe there's something magical you could do.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.420]   And it would get Andy to elaborate a little bit more
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.060]   on this kind of intimate connection.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.260]   I think Apple does that very well with iTunes.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.540]   Already, they've got the intimate connection going.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.580]   I mean, the only thing I would say
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.140]   is that right now you have something
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.180]   that not now, but three to five years from now,
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:06.940]   when OS 10 represents less than 30% or 20% of your revenue,
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.100]   you have an opportunity to wipe that market clean
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.220]   and really push all the money towards the tablets
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:14.820]   and so on and so forth.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.060]   Or you can let it slowly go off into the sunset.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.140]   And from Apple, I think that there's
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:26.100]   a much bigger upside to a scorched earth policy
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.260]   than there is in going off into the sunset.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.260]   So I think that that's there.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.540]   I think that's why they would do that.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.020]   Or one of the reasons that they would do it.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.060]   And in fact, they don't want to put any engineering resources
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.420]   into it.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.900]   We'll talk more about this in just a bit.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.700]   And there is a story that I think kind of
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.500]   reprehensible.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.260]   Apple's done this before.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.820]   They've been killing the discussion threads
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.740]   about the Consumer Reports on their website,
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.780]   the discussion groups.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.180]   But we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.060]   First, a word about Drobo.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.260]   Something Frederick knows a little bit about.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.540]   Former Drobo employee.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.020]   DROBO/Macbreak.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:02.060]   We got some special deals, $75 to $500 off a brand new Drobo,
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.900]   if it's populated with hard drives.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.340]   I was reading a great review of hard drives
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.380]   by a photographer talking about all the different connections,
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.740]   all the different ways you can use a hard drive to back up
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.260]   all the different-- and then at the end, he says, oh, by the way,
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.620]   I use a Drobo.
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.460]   And it just-- it kind of cut-- it's like, OK, you're done.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.700]   Drobo, the original Drobo with four bays
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.460]   and the capability of going up to, I think, 16 terabytes
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.820]   when we get four terabyte drives.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.860]   We're actually out to three terabyte drives now.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.620]   So you could actually put 12 terabytes in a Drobo original.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.340]   The Drobo S has five bays, right?
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.660]   That's the difference.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.740]   It's a little faster and a little bit more--
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.140]   I should explain what the Drobo is.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.300]   For people who don't know, Frederick doesn't work there anymore.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.540]   He can actually talk about these things.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.380]   I know he can.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.980]   Do you have any inside information, Frederick, about the Drobo?
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.140]   Yeah, there's a nine--
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.140]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.140]   --unit coming in.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.540]   Warning, warning.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.100]   No, no, no, no.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:55.740]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.780]   It's five bays.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.740]   The Drobo S is five bays.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.540]   And yeah, with those three terabytes,
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.420]   you can load that thing down.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.500]   That's massive.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.940]   I still haven't filled mine up with two terabytes.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.220]   Well, and here's the beauty.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.180]   So it's-- you know, at the-- and on the face of it,
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.860]   it looks like a drive enclosure, like the best design
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.340]   drive enclosure you've ever seen.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.820]   I mean, just gorgeous.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.380]   There's four lights in front.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.420]   By the way, these little touches,
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.820]   like this is a magnetic face that's easy to remove
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:22.100]   so you can pop drives in and out.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.780]   Couldn't be easier.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.100]   No screws, nothing like that.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.540]   These four lights tell you the status of the Drobo.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.700]   Green means everything's going.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.260]   There's room.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.100]   Everything's fine.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.020]   It goes to yellow.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.980]   It means this is the drive, the smallest drive.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.340]   If you want to increase capacity,
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.020]   we're starting to get to the edge of the capacity envelope.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.700]   You might want to pop this one out and put a new one in.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.700]   And that's all you have to do, by the way.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.140]   You got a four, 500 gigabyte drives in there.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.180]   You want to add capacity.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.980]   Put a terabyte drive in the smallest.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.060]   And it rebuilds itself.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.620]   You never offline.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.780]   It's amazing.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.180]   Drobo S goes to five, also has ESATA, FireWire 800,
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.500]   and USB 2.0.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.620]   The Drobo FS, that's the newest one, Gigabit Ethernet.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.220]   It's kind of like a NAS drive.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.100]   It is a NAS drive, essentially.
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.260]   There's the Drobo Pro.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.580]   Now, this is for serious storage consumers.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.340]   16 terabyte capacity.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.180]   It's got eight drives.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.860]   I guess you'd have to say now 24 terabyte
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.940]   if you put those three terabytes.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.260]   24 terabytes!
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.340]   Now!
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:25.580]   And the Drobo Pro has iSCSI to the connectivity.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.900]   The Drobo Elite can be used as a SAN.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.540]   Eight drives, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports for iSCSI.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.340]   Of course, the usual FireWire, USB, all of those choices.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.300]   Perfect for VMware virtual servers.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.220]   It's VMware certified.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.820]   Perfect for a SAN.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.500]   Up to 16 servers or workstations can connect.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.380]   This is a product line.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.180]   And I have to say, Frederick, since we started advertising
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.860]   for Drobo back when it was just the Drobo,
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.900]   they've really done a nice job.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.540]   Yeah, to expand it out nicely.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.860]   It crosses the-- from the person just getting
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:03.340]   into understanding that, oh, my data can go away one day,
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.460]   all the way up to the enterprise.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.820]   So yeah, they've expanded it out a lot.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.900]   Highly recommend if you're looking for storage,
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.620]   if you're looking for backup, if you're looking for a solution
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.580]   that will expand to fit your needs,
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.620]   whether you're a photographer, a podcaster,
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.340]   or just somebody who has a lot of stuff, Drobo is the right
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:20.780]   solution.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.300]   Here's what you do.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.260]   Go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.580]   You can find out all about our special deals.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:31.980]   The coupon code MACbreakweekly, $75 to $500 off
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:36.980]   when you purchase selected Drobo models plus hard drives.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.620]   But you can also find out more about the Drobo.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.060]   Callie Lewis, they're doing a nice little video on the Drobo.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.060]   Give you some background on it.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.820]   Drobo.com/Macbreak, we do thank them so much for their
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.140]   support.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.180]   We've been Drobo fans for years and Drobo users for even longer.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.140]   I have a lot of Drobo's.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.620]   I got the first Drobo when it first came out.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.260]   I'm still using it.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.060]   It's still in service.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.340]   I actually bought the first Drobo S ever.
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.460]   I knew you were going to say that out.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:57.660]   Ever.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.580]   I do it.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.220]   He's proud of that fact.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:01.740]   First you want.
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.340]   You feel bad.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.140]   You feel bad.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:03.900]   I got this email.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.580]   I got this email.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.380]   I have the first Drobo.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.060]   I got this email from Mark going, you bought the very first one.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:11.900]   We're pretty sure you bought it.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.540]   Somebody's right off the mark when you see a new--
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.140]   but you do that with everything.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.180]   You're the guy who put it in an order site unseen at the Apple
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:19.540]   store.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.020]   You told Travis in the San Francisco store, whatever it is.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:22.420]   I want it.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.940]   I did.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:24.620]   What was that for?
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.740]   Was that the iPhone or not?
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.740]   It was before Mac--
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.860]   it was before Macworld.
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.740]   And I was like, whatever they're announcing, just hold one.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.660]   I want it.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.940]   And he said, well, see what I can do.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.940]   Are you still that way?
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.340]   What?
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:35.820]   What?
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.620]   With Apple?
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.420]   You said, currently, there's not listening.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.220]   Well, not me.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.980]   No, I'm not that way.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.420]   No, no, no.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.580]   I have to admit, I'm a little more careful now.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.820]   But with Apple stuff, I generally
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:49.660]   know that I'm going to want whatever they're dishing out
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.740]   for the most part.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.220]   But with other stuff, I spent a lot of time having it on.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.900]   I mean, it took me two years to buy a new SLR.
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.460]   I mean, Frederick was in the middle of that conversation.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.820]   And then I bought-- now we have four of them.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.020]   But--
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.700]   You were waiting on the '50s and the '70s.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.100]   I was waiting for something that does the '50s and '70s.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.980]   So it wasn't so much that we were waiting on them.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.740]   We didn't know that they were going to be there.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.300]   And then it was trying to wait for them to go 24p.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.860]   And I just got this new camera.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.340]   I'm really kind of interested in this.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.740]   Have you played with this Frederick, the Panasonic GH1?
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.980]   No, I have not.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.140]   And the thing that's interesting about--
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.380]   I don't know if they were to borrow that from you.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.340]   Well, I did that.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.460]   There's a firmware hack.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.980]   Tester 13 puts out a--
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.460]   I read about this on Michael Rechman's Loomis Landscape
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:31.980]   photo blog.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.580]   And I know Scott Bourne has reviewed it.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.220]   Others have reviewed it.
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:39.620]   The idea behind it is that you can turn on feature.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:41.820]   The firmware hack isn't hacked firmware exactly,
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.380]   but you turn on features that are in the firmware
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.340]   that Panasonic doesn't turn on to begin with.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.220]   But you know what?
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.180]   I like this camera.
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.500]   I know it's a micro four-thirds, so it's a small sensor.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.460]   And that's not as nifty as my 5D full sensor.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.100]   But there's just some usability features
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:58.660]   that I really like.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.060]   You see a stereo mic on there.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.700]   Look at that.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.100]   And you have a mini jack so that you could put--
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.020]   I brought my dead kitten.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:05.860]   I should zoom back.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.780]   I'm a little tight.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.220]   Wow.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.140]   My dead--
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.980]   triple.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.140]   It does look like a triple, doesn't it?
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.140]   This is the-- who makes this?
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.380]   Road, road makes this.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.820]   It's a stereo--
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.100]   And it comes with a dead cat.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:20.980]   Comes with a dead cat.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.380]   And it has a mini jack, so this will work with this.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.700]   But that's the one negative on this thing.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.180]   You don't have any audio monitoring built into it.
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.180]   That's like one negative.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.460]   But apparently, if you do this firmware hack
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.260]   and you know what I have to get better flash,
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.700]   I have to order the class 10 flash.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.060]   It's coming tomorrow.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:43.140]   You can record 50 megabit--
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.180]   a JPG on this thing.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:45.540]   Right.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.540]   4.2.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:47.540]   Wow.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:48.980]   And so I'm going to play with that.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.740]   720p.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.420]   Here's the real question that I have is that it has HDMI out.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:53.540]   Yes?
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.460]   Here's what we have to do is--
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.780]   We have to try-- because these could be our studio cameras.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.780]   Well, there's no limit.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.180]   They don't overheat like the 5 and 7Ds.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.540]   Well, they don't turn off anyway.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.820]   Yeah, they might overheat, but they don't turn off.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.700]   Because the 5D turns off.
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.700]   Really?
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.700]   This is designed--
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.700]   Now, here's the other question though.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.260]   This is designed-- I think this is designed for,
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.380]   as a video camera, more than a still camera.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.060]   I really think that's what they were looking at when they
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.060]   made this.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.460]   It was made to make me still--
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   Like, look at this.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.460]   Look at this.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.980]   As you're shooting stills, at any point--
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.900]   you know, in the 5D, you have to go into this whole mode.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.820]   You just press this button and it starts recording video.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.820]   You know, that's it.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.340]   Nice.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.180]   In fact, it's kind of a problem because I was holding it
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:29.860]   like this for a while.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.140]   And I said, why am I keep shooting video?
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.940]   And then I realized, oh, I'm turning on the video.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.500]   But it really does make it easy.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.500]   It also has silent zoom and focusing.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:43.020]   It will auto aperture while you're shooting auto iris.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.540]   So it has a lot of features that you look for in a camcorder.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.020]   Does that be really interesting to see if it's
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.100]   an uncompressed HDMI signal coming out?
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:50.600]   Number one.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.420]   And number two, as if it turns off all the interfaces.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.540]   Because right now with the 5D and the 7D,
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.340]   you still get an interface.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.820]   You at least get a focus box.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:57.980]   I give this to you to play with.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.460]   OK.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.460]   I will play with this.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.220]   I want to know.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.220]   Can I take it down to the office tomorrow?
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.020]   No.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:03.520]   Oh.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.180]   I put it up against--
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.180]   Play with it for a minute.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.780]   There's going to be charts and hook to machine.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.780]   You can.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.260]   But not-- well, OK.
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.260]   I'll keep it lying around.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.940]   I give a puppy dog, guys.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.300]   I caught a-- I caught a-- I caught a--
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.820]   bought it as a second unit camera.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.860]   Because we bought it as something else at EX1.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.300]   So we have now a good first unit camera.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.700]   And I thought, sometimes when we're out in the field shooting,
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.740]   it'd be nice to have--
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.020]   And I know Alex said, don't do that because they won't
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.420]   match its different manufacturers.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:30.980]   But who cares?
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.500]   Who cares?
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:31.940]   I don't care.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.380]   They don't have to--
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.380]   It just needs to be properly--
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:34.860]   It just needs to be properly tested.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.020]   That's all.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.420]   We need to put it up against charts.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.420]   See how I work my way in my evil ways here.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.580]   We need to put it up against charts.
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:42.900]   We need to test the compression rate.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:42.900]   OK.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:43.900]   We need to--
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.180]   Thank you.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.780]   Thank you.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.260]   But you know what?
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.260]   I'm not giving you the charger.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.980]   So you got one battery charge worth of play time.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.580]   OK.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.100]   I'm going to turn it right down.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.340]   That way I get it back.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.700]   I'm going to turn it off.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.180]   There we go.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:55.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.220]   I would like to play with it a little more.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:57.580]   All right.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.780]   Well, how long will you have it just to say?
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:58.980]   Just one day.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.540]   I'll just bring it back.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:00.020]   I'll bring it back.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.460]   I'll bring it back Thursday morning.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.380]   Don't do it, Leo.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.020]   Don't do it.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.260]   And I'll tell you all the new things.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.060]   And we're going to be streaming live all day tomorrow
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:08.820]   from Pixelcore.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.220]   So maybe stream it.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.220]   So people will see us streaming it and testing it.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:12.540]   All right.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.420]   But I've got to give you the plug,
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.100]   because you really, really need more power.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.060]   I think it's totally charged.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060]   But I think you'll need more power.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:17.500]   We'll be streaming.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.860]   So you'll get to see us doing it.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.620]   So you'll know that I'm actually not out.
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.380]   I don't know.
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.580]   Shooting a movie with it or anything.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:23.540]   You'll know that I'm testing it.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.940]   You'll see the testing in action.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.380]   Like going deep into the closet,
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.820]   give them like a 256 megabyte memory card.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.780]   And then like glue the door shut.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.420]   Don't make sure you get it back.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.860]   No, he's not going to record.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.860]   He's not going to record.
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.140]   I don't need any impress.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.300]   I don't need no stinking video.
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.740]   His theme is what he's going to do.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.540]   I want to see what the HDMI looks like on the way out.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.060]   I just, you know, I shouldn't have bought it.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.620]   But I just because I have a 5D.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.140]   And I never use a video on the 5D.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.180]   But I just thought this might be really kind of a nice.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:50.780]   It's so much smaller.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:58.100]   That is a 14 to 140 lens, which is effectively 28 to 280.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.060]   That's crazy.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.060]   So that's amazing.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.540]   I'm amazed they're making micro four thirds cameras that
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.460]   are now the size of SLRs though.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:06.780]   It's a little big.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.180]   It's bigger than the EP1.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.220]   The one thing I will be--
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.860]   Oh, by the way, it uses the EP1 lenses.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.620]   Because the mount is the same.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.300]   It's a vendor in unspecific formats.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:16.820]   Right.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.420]   Any micro four thirds will run.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.300]   I kind of like that.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.740]   So I have a 17 pancake I can use from my EP1.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.740]   It's silver though, and it's a black body.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.580]   I will be interested to see how long--
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.580]   Because I know that with the 5D, after 30 minutes, the chip--
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   I mean, it automatically--
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.220]   It doesn't--
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.460]   That's a European restriction.
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.180]   And I turned that off in the firmware.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.820]   There is a legal requirement in Europe
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.540]   that if you record more than 30 minutes,
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.740]   you have to tax it at--
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.820]   It's a camcorder.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:44.100]   You have to tax it as a camcorder, which is a higher rate.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.540]   So the firmware that tests your 13 firmware changer
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.580]   turns that off in that camera.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.380]   That's the rumor that about the 5D, which
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.020]   is why all those limitations occur on the 5D and the 70,
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.540]   is actually--
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:54.060]   The 5D?
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.540]   --is actually to have 12 minutes.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.340]   Well, it's four gigs.
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.340]   They just had it to four gigs.
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:57.700]   OK.
[00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:58.780]   So I think it--
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.380]   I think the issue was overheating, though, too.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.620]   Well, I don't know.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:08.220]   Anyway, that is the GH1 Panasonic Lumix GH1.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.180]   It's about $12,000 tomorrow.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.420]   With the lens, it's $1200.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:13.660]   I don't know.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.900]   I'm just thinking it's a--
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.860]   I don't know.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.460]   I have no excuse.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.820]   It's pretty.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:22.180]   So why did Apple-- what's wrong with Apple?
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.940]   They've done this before, and if you
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:29.180]   mention Consumer Reports in the Apple discussion groups,
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.940]   the official support forums, you will get deleted.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.900]   Not once, not twice.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.980]   According to the artificial Apple web log,
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.380]   six times, Bing has cashed it, isn't that ironic.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.060]   Can we cause a little trouble?
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.500]   OK, everybody watching?
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.460]   OK, ready?
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.140]   Everybody watching this show go to the Apple forums
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.580]   and just make comments about Consumer Reports.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.580]   Just say, hey, did you just do it right now?
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.580]   Do you see it right now?
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.660]   This is what you get, by the way, is there's nobody
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.300]   talking about it.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:02.900]   What are you talking?
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.900]   Consumer Reports, what are you saying?
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.860]   So maybe this is just over-zealous mods.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.940]   I think it's generally a mistake to do that kind of stuff.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.980]   It's a big mistake.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.020]   You know, a lot of--
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.660]   And we're just-- we're hopefully going
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.820]   to point that out right now, because your job right now,
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.020]   if you're watching, is to go make comments.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.820]   This is a good experiment.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.140]   But it's also a demonstration of how having community
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.620]   is a big responsibility for larger corporations.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.940]   You can't just-- can't be all good all the time.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.660]   You have to take the good with the bad--
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.460]   It's a bad problem.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.180]   When I talk to companies about opening up,
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.460]   I do raise this issue.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.100]   I say, you're going to get negative comments.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.140]   How are you going to handle it?
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.860]   How are you going to feel about that?
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.060]   It does put them in-- having that forum
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.900]   does put Apple in sort of a bad position,
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.100]   because it seems to be completely set up,
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.460]   not as just a community forum, just for people
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.860]   who like Apple products to talk about how much they like them
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.100]   or how much they dislike them.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.700]   It's a form of user support for people who are having problems.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.900]   And if they're going to say that we're
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.340]   going to have an open forum, then that
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.100]   would mean that they would have to allow all kinds of discussion,
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.620]   even on the consumer reports, things.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.300]   But when they're talking about a support forum
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.180]   and they find a thread that is really negative to Apple,
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.300]   doesn't really help people find solutions.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.260]   They just help people to complain about how bad this article is.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.460]   And in the absence of Apple's ability
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.340]   to use that forum to say anything official,
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.780]   because this is a user forum.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.260]   It's not a company forum.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.740]   It almost seems as though they have a very, very limited list
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.740]   of options to choose from.
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.340]   And they chose the, well, look, it's not helping people.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.180]   It doesn't have how to tips and how to fix this.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.620]   So we're just going on that basis.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.140]   I am going to amend this story.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.220]   Despite what TUAW said, there are now a number of threads
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.260]   started today.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.220]   Like this one, consumer reports confirms
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.820]   existence of hardware-related antenna
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.860]   problem, which have not been taken down,
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.580]   which have a lot of discussion around it.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.020]   So maybe it was early on overzealous mods.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.140]   Maybe the word came down from Apple on high.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.900]   Leave it, because this, certainly this thread,
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.100]   while you get, and I think this is a way to be the case,
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.740]   always be the case on an Apple discussion forums,
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.500]   you get Apple fanboys who say, oh, well,
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.780]   it doesn't mean anything.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.620]   But I think you also get some negative stuff, too.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:19.740]   And I think that maybe this is an amended policy on Apple's part.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:22.620]   So I'm going to amend our story to say that, at least for now,
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.020]   these discussions stay there.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.300]   They did delete them early on, but so far they're on.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.900]   That's the frustrating thing about trying
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.180]   to talk about anything with Apple, because their secrecy
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.940]   is so tight that you're just really welcome to speculate
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.620]   on any of the 30 reasons why they might have killed that thread.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.540]   And you will never know what the real reason was.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.220]   And it could be something as simple as Lenny,
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.140]   who's not the top moderator they've got working there,
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.180]   decided to kill it.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.780]   Then three hours later, the real guy came back in with a little bit
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.500]   of a take-out.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.700]   I go out for a stop box and this is what you're doing.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.100]   You're killing me, Lenny.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.940]   You're killing me.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.180]   I'm trying to wake you.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.020]   Get out of here.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.180]   Our Lenny.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.660]   Oh.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.420]   It's a new show.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.940]   Yes, that crazy Lenny Apple discussion for a moderator.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.380]   What will he be up to next?
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.620]   Oh, I accidentally opened this can of two-pot adhesive,
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.260]   and now the CEO is stuck to the chair.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.940]   Oh, that's our Lenny.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.140]   I think it is hard.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.540]   I mean, you have to--
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.420]   there's a lot of business issues that are related to it.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.420]   I always think it's a mistake to--
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.620]   you have to be extremely careful about deleting things
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.940]   unless they've gone outside of certain rules that you've
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.220]   really set up ahead of time.
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.500]   You could reasonably say, there will be no negative discussion
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.180]   of Apple products on this forum.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.020]   And then you have a standard, and I might not
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.220]   be where you'd want to hang out.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.300]   But you didn't say that ahead of time.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.660]   That's the issue is just setting up those expectations.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.180]   But I will say, I mean, I'm going to go back to--
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.060]   I mean, I think that that's a mistake.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.940]   I also think, though, if you have an iPhone that you're not
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.660]   happy with because of the antenna, just take it back,
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.580]   stop complaining about it.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.460]   I mean, get a bumper or whatever, just let it go.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.460]   You know, it's just not that big of a deal.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.820]   Sorry, I just wanted to say that.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:02.340]   You just go to--
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.180]   I'm so tired of listening.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:03.940]   I mean, I just--
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.900]   I totally, differently.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.900]   I'm just like, Ryan, I'm just like, Ryan, I'm not--
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.700]   No, so hold it differently.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.300]   If it's really a problem for you, take it back.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.260]   And if you're not going to take it back,
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.620]   you're not going to take it back.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.220]   Most people, 99.9999% are not going
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.100]   to take the iPhone 4 back because it's the best phone
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.300]   they ever owned.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.780]   And it drops a couple of calls, and some of us
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.420]   see that as a feature.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.420]   I think you should take it to the Apple Friend bar,
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.980]   and maybe they'll have a nice conversation with you.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.700]   Building on the success of their genius bar is today,
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.260]   Apple stores across the country unveiled the Friend bar,
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:41.460]   where obsessive Apple users can come to discuss Mac products
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.340]   at length.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:46.500]   Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.580]   Thanks, Andrea.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.420]   Apple users looking for someone to talk
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.540]   at about the newest Twitter iPhone app
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.700]   or why Safari is an infinitely better browser
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.460]   than Firefox can now simply make an appointment
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.340]   at Apple's new Friend bar.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   Free to anyone with an Apple care warranty,
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.740]   the Friend bar is staffed by Apple employees,
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.580]   especially trained to carry on lengthy conversations
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.300]   about even the most arcane Apple related topics.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.220]   Unlike your girlfriend or your coworkers,
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.660]   we're not going to get tired of discussing
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.340]   the wireless networking capabilities
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.860]   at Snow Leopard operating system.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.180]   We're here, and we're ready to listen.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.380]   The Friend bar is already a success,
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.420]   with some Apple fans scheduling appointments
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.100]   up to four hours in length.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.020]   Drives me so nuts that Firefox is disabling the blood
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.540]   in Fermato, IC3.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.620]   Genius bars across the country are reporting shorter wait
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.220]   times as customers who just want to impress
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.940]   Apple employees with their ironic desktop image
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.460]   or their impeccably organized iTunes library
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.420]   are redirected to the Friend bar.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.420]   And the discussions don't have to be limited
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.620]   to Apple products.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.620]   Friend bar employees are trained to discuss
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.300]   a range of topics Apple customers are interested in,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.140]   from finding a good Neapolitan pizza
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.900]   to talking to girls who aren't already
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.180]   in an improv group with.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.900]   I think what our customers appreciate is the fact
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.860]   they've got a multinational
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.420]   consumer electron corporation that they can relate to.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   The Friend bar is not the only good news for Apple fans.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.860]   The 24 hour Friend line connects users to call centers
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.100]   overseas where they can talk about Apple
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.460]   even after store hours.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.620]   That's just using GarageBand.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.500]   I like to use the high movie
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.300]   if I'm just making a slideshow roll on things.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.900]   Yes, I'll use the final cut of the fret.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.220]   (laughing)
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.540]   Yesterday I uploaded some footage of these kids.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.980]   Oh, it ain't that it's any interesting.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.780]   The company also announced that next year
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.340]   it will roll out the iStore, a miniature version
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   of an Apple Store which customers can set up
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.540]   in their own homes.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.140]   It's gonna be about $6,000 for the hardware.
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.700]   And there's a monthly salary for your personal Apple employee
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.700]   that of course anything you buy from the store.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.260]   For Tech Trends, I'm Jeff Tate.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.620]   I think you need that in your house.
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.100]   On the air.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.100]   By the way, that's courtesy of--
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.540]   We didn't ask, but that's courtesy of the Onion News Network.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.900]   And they do such a good job.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.740]   Oh my gosh.
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.860]   I mean, really, I think that there are people
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.540]   who probably thought that was real.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.340]   I mean, it looked like an Apple Store.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.540]   In every respect, it was perfect.
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.340]   I bet money that there are teachers like that
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.580]   that are now available for sale by someone somewhere.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.140]   Yeah, Apple Friends.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.140]   Your Apple Friends.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.780]   No, here's the words, but I think it would actually
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.780]   be pretty successful.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.260]   It would absolutely.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.580]   That's basically what this show is.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.180]   It's us talking obsessively about--
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.540]   Do each other's hair, talk about boys.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.660]   It would be wonderful.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.500]   That's what we need.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.180]   And I think that was the original idea
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.820]   of that 888 FaceTime number.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.460]   Really, I'm sure that that's where this came from.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:25.980]   Remember?
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.500]   Hi.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.020]   Hi.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:27.700]   I see you.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:28.260]   I see you.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.340]   I want to FaceTime.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.780]   You know, my daughter is going to college,
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.420]   and she's debating whether to get an iPhone.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.540]   She has this whole very odd thing.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:38.220]   She said, well, whatever phone I carry--
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.220]   and that this may be telling about this generation--
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:45.180]   will be a statement about me and my means and my class.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:50.500]   And I want to know, are we upper middle class or not?
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.620]   Because if I'm going to carry the iPhone,
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.060]   I'm going to need to spend at that level.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.780]   If not, I'd like to carry just a dumb feature phone,
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:02.500]   because I don't want to set up any expectations about who I am.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.260]   And I said, well, honey, we could FaceTime while you're
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.140]   at college.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.540]   She said, I'm getting a dumb phone.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.060]   She was done.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.300]   That settles it.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.820]   And now the human race--
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.300]   He's getting a razor.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.980]   --is failure is complete.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.460]   She said, this school is very hip.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.540]   It's full of hipsters.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:21.220]   And I just want to know, it conveys a lot about--
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.300]   and it's true-- about what phone?
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.700]   She says, when I was at revision 3,
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.820]   everybody had an iPhone.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:28.340]   And I don't know.
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.380]   Is that me?
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.180]   She's trying to find herself.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.740]   When we were kids, we'd have to do that with bands.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.900]   It's exactly the same.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.340]   Don't you think--
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.380]   and if you're the indie hipster, you say, well, no,
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.820]   I use Ubuntu.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.700]   And if you're like kind of square, you say, well,
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:49.100]   I think Windows XP is really the solution for me.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:49.940]   Don't you think?
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.740]   I use the Mac.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.300]   It's a universal experience.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.940]   When I shop for my first new pair of eyeglass frames
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.860]   in 10 or 15 years, I think the number one criterion is,
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.940]   what style is not available in every single lens
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:04.420]   crafters?
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.660]   And that really limited me to about eight different styles.
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:11.660]   How long has it been with those lenses, frames?
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.500]   You've been--
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.540]   You're wearing new ones.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.900]   These are the new ones that I got about three years ago.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.740]   And the search only ended when I realized that the frames that
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.060]   I really, really like are my sunglass frames.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.540]   And then I spent like three more weeks
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.660]   trying to find eyeglass frames just like that before I realized
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.660]   that, remember, Andy, you're a dumbass.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.900]   You can actually get the sunglass frames at the same store
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.100]   you got them from and have the put clear lenses in them.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.100]   Oh, that's right.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.300]   Who, hell clever.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.700]   Which means I'm just part of that whole--
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.180]   I want different eyeglass frames marketing trend
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.700]   that lens crafters is probably going to be--
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:47.300]   It's the next--
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:47.820]   Oh, get you.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.100]   Big thing.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.860]   You want to see some bad eyeglass frames?
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.100]   I'm going to go back to the eyeglasses
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:00.500]   that I was wearing in 1992, I think this was.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.700]   And I think this is definitely where you don't want to go, Andy.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.100]   Just a word of warning.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.620]   That is probably not--
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.060]   those are not the eyeglasses you're looking for.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.580]   Wow.
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.380]   OK, so I am also wearing suspenders.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:20.700]   So I'm obviously a complete-- this is me after the makeover.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.660]   I heard before--
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.180]   Before you asked.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.780]   I read an article by an official White House photographer.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:28.140]   And he was saying that one of the tips he always gives,
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.780]   like people who get their picture taken with the president,
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.380]   is to take off their glasses because it's the one thing that
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.540]   will absolutely date you or date the photo.
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.900]   And with those glasses, nobody dated me.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.980]   I had a--
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:40.980]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.980]   Hi.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.300]   I have to say that I have a picture of me
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.900]   with Sting in 1991.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.860]   With little wireframe round glasses.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.140]   And the only thing I look at is like, oh, it's such a great photo.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.220]   And I can't believe I was wearing glasses.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.700]   Well, and the cell phone would do the same thing
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:56.900]   if you hold a cell phone.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.980]   And that's why old movies, they got a word of advice
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.860]   to movie directors do not put a cell phone in the shot.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.100]   Because it's like having a wide tie immediately.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.940]   I was watching X-Files last night in series one.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:09.940]   And they pick up the cell phone.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:11.500]   It's like this huge box.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.020]   I know.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.180]   It's that funny.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.620]   Because in every other aspect, it would look completely normal.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.380]   You wouldn't be able to place it.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.620]   Maybe the hairstyles, sometimes the clothes, but the cell phone.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.340]   Boom.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:22.780]   Instantly.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:25.300]   And it's only a few years.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.780]   I got to recommend that if the original taking a Pelham 1, 2, 3
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.660]   is kind of a regular rotation on cable now.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.420]   And it is the most perfect example.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:38.300]   If you want to see what the world was like in 1973, 1974,
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.620]   the whole thing was shot on location,
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.740]   especially when they're in the big massive command center
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.500]   that runs the entire subway system in New York City.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.780]   And some of them are mostly using the Buddy Holly model
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.220]   microphones to talk to each other.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.020]   But two different locations-- and this is an actual location
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.660]   they're using-- actually has a candlestick phone
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.300]   on one of those scissors sort of--
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.100]   You're kidding.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.100]   Wow.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.260]   And it's not like the governor's
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.620]   master and everything like that.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.900]   But you're like, wow, it's a carbon microphone.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.620]   It kept working.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.500]   So they just never thought to replace it.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500]   Oh my god.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.340]   It's so stupid.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.700]   It's like having a bow.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.940]   You know, when everyone-- it's like the Incredibles.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.300]   Remember that line in the Incredibles when they said--
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.020]   when the villain says, when everyone is super, no one is?
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.500]   So now, when everyone has a smartphone--
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.500]   You know, why not be trendy and go with a dumb phone?
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.380]   I will ask what my daughter's doing.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.260]   That's exactly what my daughter's up to.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.540]   I had this idea a few days ago when
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.260]   I was going through stuff-- my technology had my storage locker.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.540]   And I will open source this idea.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.420]   And anybody wants to use it.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.740]   That I bought like an old bag phone, like $3.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.820]   They have my T-Flee market.
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.860]   And I was looking at the handset and realizing that, gee,
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.580]   the keypad and like the vacuum LED number display,
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.260]   that's about the size of an iPhone.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.580]   I bet that I could like take apart this handset,
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:56.340]   hollow out like the grip of it, and basically turn that--
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:01.020]   just the grip of it into like an iPhone dock, run USB signals
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.420]   like through the curly cables, plugs into the car lighter.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.540]   And so anytime I want to like use my iPhone inside the car,
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.380]   I will just be a big shot in the car
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.980]   like with a big old, feist and head phone
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:10.980]   with the curly thing in the back.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.500]   And people will think he's a back to the future guy.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.980]   He's an IP88.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.740]   Even though I've got my iPhone formed there.
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.140]   Here's Walter Mathout taking a Pelham 1, 2, 3.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.860]   Look at that microphone he's talking into.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:23.780]   Light bulbs.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.540]   Everybody.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.980]   Light bulbs would come on in that big board
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.100]   to show where the train was within 50 yards.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.220]   And look, he's got a dial, a rotary dial phone.
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.140]   Louis CK would love this film.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.380]   That is a-- it is a testimony to lumpy middle-aged white guys.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.140]   Walter Mathout is the quintessential.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.740]   Jerry Stiller was in it.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:47.420]   Like Vincent Gardenia was in it.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:50.340]   All these middle-aged lumpy white guy character actors
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.180]   from the '70s are represented in this movie.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:56.380]   It was-- I've now made a note that I have to actually record
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.420]   this because I just enjoyed it so much.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.980]   I think that I really think that the solution, the iPhone
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.500]   solution for college is to get an old phone
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.420]   and then put the iPhone 4 in that guy.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:08.980]   Well, that's a good one.
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.220]   That's kind of what Woz did, right?
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.700]   He put it in a black--
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:12.860]   Then she gave me super hip.
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:14.140]   Because she and I got the new look here.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:14.620]   Not hip.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.500]   For this is how we're going to look now from now on and to it.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.380]   We're going to speak into these old microphones.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:21.980]   And I have the metal headphones.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.540]   What do you think?
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.740]   You look like radar.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.660]   No, see, Leo, I mean, you're one of these tech hipsters.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.820]   What's wrong with a megaphone like in the 1920s?
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.060]   Hello, America!
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.180]   At all the ships at sea.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.780]   Let's go to press.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.820]   I guess this is a great megaphone.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.660]   This is actually a phone.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.980]   I could use this microphone for you.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.820]   Finding for you.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.340]   See, megaphones.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.180]   It amplifies.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.220]   It distributes.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.460]   Why make a big show of it?
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.060]   Hipsters.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.980]   Damn hipsters.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.780]   Damn hipsters.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:48.980]   Damn them!
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.540]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.500]   I can't hear a thing.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.140]   Oh, I know why.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:52.900]   I'm wearing those.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.900]   OK.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:56.900]   Back to the--
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.540]   You have to turn the crank and ask for Sparky
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.620]   for the next 100-90s.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:03.500]   But we're going to come back with your picks of the week
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.700]   in just a little bit.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:07.660]   And there's some good ones I know.
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.900]   Is there anything before I do that?
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.380]   Is there anything in the news that I've missed?
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.900]   I'm sure there is.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:18.340]   Big stories that I like to do this because the other day
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.100]   on a twit, we missed the biggest story of the week.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.660]   And I felt so guilty afterwards.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.980]   So I'm going to put you on the spot, gentlemen.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.260]   Or a chat room.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.620]   Anything in the chat room that--
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:34.700]   they're still going off on the taking a Pelham 1, 2, 3.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.220]   And of course, they love this.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.700]   And what I mentioned this, the old Spice guy's apparently
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:44.980]   made a get well video for Kevin Rose.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.940]   Is that possible?
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.140]   Anything in the news that we missed?
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.180]   I see you going through your iPhone 4.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.660]   Yeah, I was looking for--
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.620]   No, I can't think of anything.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.940]   I didn't know Kevin Rose was sick.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.260]   He's been sick for a couple of weeks.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:02.620]   Really?
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:03.980]   Haven't you been following his Twitter?
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:04.620]   No.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.820]   What has he got?
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:09.220]   The flu.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:11.580]   And he gets the old Spice guy to make a video for him?
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.260]   That's what I call a viral video.
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.420]   Oh, for doing--
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.060]   Now let's bring out your headliner.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.180]   You've been great.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.420]   All right, here we go.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:19.940]   Whoo.
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.020]   How are you?
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.780]   Feeling better, I hope.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:24.540]   I personally have never had a fever
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.700]   because my body is 98% muscle.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.700]   And muscles can't get sick.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.620]   The 1% of my body that isn't muscle is my ears.
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.940]   They're made of cartilage.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.580]   But I did some research.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:37.180]   And it doesn't look like you can get a fever in your ears,
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:40.100]   which I think we both can agree is a glorious thing.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.780]   That being said, although I'm clearly
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.460]   winning in the physical department,
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.300]   you seem to have the edge intellectually
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.620]   because you are a genius at the internet.
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.340]   Can you imagine if your smart brain could team up
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:55.260]   with my strong muscle body and wildly handsome face parts?
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:56.980]   No, you can't.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.020]   I can't.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.140]   No one can.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.100]   Because if anyone tried to imagine that,
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.580]   their brain would explode, and that's just not healthy.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.900]   Thanks again, Kevin.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.700]   Or in your genius smart computer language.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:13.340]   1001011010100001.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:15.700]   I think that's a form of fame, isn't it?
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.460]   If you get the old Spice guy with a get well card--
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.420]   Man, when--
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.620]   You know, they can get a whole business where you could just
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.340]   do cards, the old Spice cards.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.940]   I mean, they brought him in.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.020]   They put him in the shower.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.180]   They took off his shirt.
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:27.660]   I can imagine those.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:28.460]   Just a cost millions.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.980]   If they're smart, they would have done that
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:32.340]   to a lot of different-- like the Ellen DeGeneres one,
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.500]   that one, a whole bunch of them all at the same time.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.500]   Well, obviously they did.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.740]   And this is smart viral marketing.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.580]   We didn't, in Kennedy, one of the smartest agencies out there
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.500]   up in Portland, they know what they're doing.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.820]   We would like to say that Leo doesn't have an old Spice one
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.620]   yet.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.140]   That's OK.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:48.820]   I don't want one.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.660]   I'd be creeped out, frankly, if a naked guy
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.260]   in the shower said--
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.140]   Leo, I'm gorgeous.
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:55.140]   And you're sick.
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:56.140]   Well, I want to leave you--
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.420]   I'm writing plans right now to create a video for you.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:59.580]   I think you could do it.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.740]   Oh, we can do it.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.820]   Take off your shirt, Frederick.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.780]   I think you've got the muscle to do it.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.900]   I am not taking off my shirt, sorry.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.500]   I'm just going to try to bring my pencils to me.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.020]   It's a different show entirely, my friend.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:11.020]   It is.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:13.060]   It is a different show entirely.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:13.940]   Let's take a break.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.500]   We're going to come back with your picks of the week.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.140]   And this portion of the show brought to you
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.580]   by our good friends at audible.com.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.460]   I-- well, this is kind of be my pick,
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.820]   but I'm going to actually have another pick.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.740]   I'll do it right now.
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.220]   I am so happy.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.820]   Audible has released the iPhone app.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.460]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:35.900]   Now, there is absolutely no reason for you iPhone users
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.580]   not to run out and join Audible.
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.700]   Audible.com/Macbreak, your first one is free.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.340]   Actually, if you can download the phone app is free,
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.500]   and you can download it, and it comes with excerpts.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.580]   So if you're very interested, you could take a look at it.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.820]   There you-- Andy's got it on there.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.500]   You know what I like?
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.060]   This was the same thing I liked about the Android version of it
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:55.940]   was.
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.620]   It has your whole library on it.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:01.180]   So you download your whole library,
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.780]   and you can-- this is the wireless syncing.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:09.460]   We've wanted all these years for our iTunes
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.420]   is now available for Audible.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.140]   So every one of my books--
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.140]   it's well over 400 books.
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:16.980]   I just love it.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.180]   It's nicely organized, too.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.700]   I was surprised that what it can also do
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.740]   is it can actually also find Audible content that's
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.420]   already in your iTunes library on your device.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.940]   Yeah, you could turn that on a lot.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.900]   So if you're already syncing books via iTunes,
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:31.740]   it's not so you have to have two different copies of this library.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.300]   I'm not sure if I've ever seen an audio app actually do that.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.620]   You know, I think that they weren't
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.220]   sure that they'd get approved, to be honest,
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.020]   because they did not tell us anything about this ahead of time.
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.500]   I've been singing the praises of the Android one, which
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.100]   is still in beta all this time.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.260]   And I'm sure that they've thought, oh, well, we really--
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.420]   we should tell them about the iPhone version.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.900]   But I think they might have thought,
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.500]   are we not sure if this is going to get approved?
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.380]   Well, I think I'd have to look through my inbox to be sure.
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.700]   But I think I actually got an email from Audible.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:04.260]   I got one out of every five, six, or seven different app
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.660]   announcements.
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.700]   It's a big, long, formal press release followed by, yeah,
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.420]   actually, they're paid a few little hang ups.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.780]   But we do expect to be approved by the time you get this.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.940]   Or if you look for an app and didn't find it,
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.460]   but it is available now and downloadable.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:17.740]   And for the decision day.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.100]   And all three.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.940]   And as you said, it plays audiobooks
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.500]   that you've synced via iTunes.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.020]   But you can, for the first time in my knowledge,
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.020]   download audiobooks or some kind of audio content via Wi-Fi.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.780]   It does have to be Wi-Fi for most of these books
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:32.860]   because it's over 20 megabytes.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.420]   But yeah, anything you've actually already paid for--
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.420]   It's in the library.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.300]   Oh, we'll see that.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.460]   But if you've already paid for it,
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.940]   but you haven't downloaded it yet, see that little gray box.
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.180]   That's actually a download button.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:43.540]   Right.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.620]   So if I decide that, you know what?
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:49.460]   I really want to have Born standing up just tap it and blank.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.540]   It'll just download immediately.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.220]   It's so cool.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.540]   I have to say.
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.700]   It really is a good peek at how cool this could be
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.780]   if we had that sort of access to iTunes content,
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.020]   where you don't necessarily have to sync everything.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.460]   But if you're out of the house and you realize that, man,
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:04.060]   I really wish I'd sunk that really great album that I downloaded
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:04.940]   just two weeks ago.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:05.700]   Ain't nobody should bought it.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.140]   Go ahead.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.020]   Well, and that's what I was really excited about with the Android app,
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:12.660]   is that I no longer had to remember to get something.
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.540]   Now, people complain you can't buy within the app.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.300]   But you have Safari on here.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:17.220]   You can absolutely.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.860]   In fact, I tried it yesterday.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:20.980]   Go to the browser, buy an application.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.380]   You don't have to download it in Safari.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.940]   You just add it to your--
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.180]   you know, say I bought it and then refresh.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.220]   And it will download all of your books.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:29.340]   It'll update your library.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:30.860]   And now you'll be able to download the library
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.620]   from within the app.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:35.500]   So it is absolutely the case that you can buy and then
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.100]   download directly on the iPhone.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.460]   See, I'm downloading the Contortionist's Handbook
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.980]   right now, which is a very wild book.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.260]   Yeah, I'm really enjoying it.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.580]   Have you finished it yet?
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.060]   Not yet.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.740]   It has a funny ending.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   It's really lucky.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.940]   It's a happy-- slap happy go lucky.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.580]   Reformation of life.
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:57.740]   It's very much like Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman meets Highway to Heaven.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.220]   Just that sort of uplift.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.340]   It's a really good book, I have to say.
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.900]   I'm also listening to Count of Monte Cristo.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.500]   One of my favorite all time books.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.820]   I'm a big William Gaddis fan.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.900]   JR is now out.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.780]   And I've been listening to that.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:15.100]   That's 37 hours on JR, 50 hours on Count of Monte Cristo.
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.340]   So just those two books alone.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.620]   I got 87 hours.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.700]   And by the way, you download--
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.940]   have you figured out, Andy, on the app what the quality is?
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:25.860]   It doesn't give you a chance to choose the quality.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:30.460]   So I'm not sure what kind of quality I'm getting on that.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.860]   I haven't had a chance to really test it.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.100]   It sounds fine.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.500]   I mean, I did download something.
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.220]   It does sound fine, but I haven't done a comparison
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.100]   between what it sounds like on my MacBook
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.220]   versus what it sounds like.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:42.740]   The version I downloaded on my MacBooks versus the version
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.340]   that's on there.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.420]   I also don't know, for instance, what happens.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:45.900]   It's brand new.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.420]   I've only had it for a day now.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:50.020]   I also don't know what happens if you download a book
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.020]   from your Audible Library on the iPhone
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:53.580]   and then dock it to iTunes.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.500]   Is iTunes see that as new content?
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.580]   Then we'll sync it back into your library or whatever.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:01.340]   I just basically turned off book syncing and iTunes now.
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.220]   I don't want it anymore, because I'm getting them all just
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:06.860]   directly into the phone from the app.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:09.500]   I have to say, this was one reason I was going to switch back
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.060]   to Android.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.460]   I'm so glad they came out with this.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.940]   It makes the iPhone 4 that much better.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.900]   There's certain specific features
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.380]   that you want to have in an audio book listening app,
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.860]   as opposed to just a general player that's
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.180]   designed to let you listen to a two minute song or a whole album
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.340]   that's set up into tracks.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:25.940]   It's much better.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:26.860]   It's a much richer experience.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.740]   That's fantastic.
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:28.700]   Great video.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:33.700]   They have a very nice feature where a user interface feature,
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.820]   where you actually can press this button
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.940]   and then it supports gestures.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.980]   Tap it once to pause it.
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:43.900]   You can go left, go back 30 seconds,
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:46.500]   swipe right to go forward 30 seconds,
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.740]   and you can bookmark it by swiping up.
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.300]   This is frankly-- this is the best way
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.260]   to listen to the audio books ever.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:55.820]   I am--
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.020]   What the--
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.020]   What?
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:58.700]   Sorry.
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.380]   It's great.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:24:59.900]   I love it.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:00.420]   It's amazing.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:00.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.020]   This is it.
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.420]   It has everything you'd want.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:08.100]   And including iPhone 4 multitasking in the background.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.460]   So you can be listening to the book,
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:13.620]   exit out of the application, start playing script.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.540]   You know, they should-- someone at Skype
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:18.700]   should call them to find out how to do background.
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.420]   Yeah, they still haven't figured that out, have they?
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.100]   Well, they only showed it at the-- not that I'm bitter.
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.820]   I'm in a bitter mood today.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.180]   We are.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.220]   We're bitter.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.180]   Anyway, if--
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.100]   I can-- I got to stop the-- hold on.
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:32.860]   I don't want to miss a piece of this kind of money,
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.860]   but I'm going to miss a piece of it.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.500]   OK, stop there.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.420]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.620]   Here's how you get your first book,
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:40.020]   and then you can listen to it on the iPhone.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.140]   Although there are some excerpts from some of my favorite books
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:43.860]   are on the app for free.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.460]   So you can't get at least get a taste of it
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.020]   without even joining Audible.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.020]   But get a free book.
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.660]   You'll sign up for the gold account
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.700]   and get it credit towards a free book.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.740]   Lots of great choices.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.780]   Andy always has something good to listen to.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.100]   What do you recommend today?
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.860]   Today, I'm a bit of a departure.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.300]   I am recommending a book that I haven't listened to yet.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.660]   Usually, either I've already bought it.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.220]   I'm halfway through it, or I like it,
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.500]   but I got the book itself and read the first three, four
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.860]   chapters to make sure that it sort of lives up to the hype.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:13.860]   But there's a few authors and a few, especially in audiobooks,
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:17.580]   where if the name appears in the list of new releases,
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:18.820]   it's just going to get downloaded.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.060]   I'm adding to the wish list if I don't have enough credits,
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.900]   but at some point, I'm going to download it.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.180]   And on that list is Anthony Bourdain.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.140]   Oh, I love him.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.140]   He's great.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.900]   He sees-- it's kind of denigrating him to refer to him
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.220]   as a TV chef, because he's not one of those guys who builds
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.460]   a Harley-Davidson themed wedding cake
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.660]   and then has to drive it 400 miles to a winter prize.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.660]   He travels and talks about cooking and restaurants
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.180]   and international food.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.340]   He first became famous with a really wonderful book called
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.620]   Kitchen Confidential about 10 years ago that
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.960]   talked about his career as a chef and what it is really
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.620]   like to be a chef and to be one of these people who works
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:57.180]   in the food industry but also enjoys food from that end.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:01.420]   And so he has a new book out called Medium Raw, A Bloody
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.540]   Valentine-- A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.860]   and the People Who Cooked.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.980]   Which is sort of a sequel to that book.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.260]   It's about here's what's happened in the past 10 years,
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:18.300]   not only to me, going from a former drug-addicted chef
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.340]   on Cape Cod and other restaurants to the best restaurants
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:23.820]   in the world, to someone who spends most of his time
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.260]   talking and writing and broadcasting about food,
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.540]   but also talking about what has happened to restaurants,
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.420]   especially what has happened now that watching people eat
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.180]   and watching people cook has been such a big entertainment
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:34.860]   activity.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.140]   But it could be-- if Anthony Bourdain wanted
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.660]   to write a 300 page book about what
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.460]   it was like trying to get his HDTV hooked up in his living
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.900]   room, he would make it interesting and profane and wonderful.
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.220]   So I will be shot.
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.340]   I have not listened to this yet.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:53.260]   I just noticed like a few-- I'm sorry, someone on Twitter
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.860]   just a couple of days ago pointed out to me
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.180]   that he had this new book out on audio.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.460]   And I'm like, well, it just came out.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:57.980]   It just--
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:58.480]   Done.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:58.980]   It came out.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.460]   I'm not sure six days ago, so--
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.540]   Six days ago, right.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.380]   I just heard an interview.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.860]   I think he was on "Precious Air" or something like that.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.740]   And I just heard this interview.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.460]   And he's just so much fun to look at.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:08.780]   Let me just play a little bit of this.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.260]   You'll hear his voice.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.180]   This is a wild boar paté on Crute, the narrow area
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:15.140]   between force meat and crust filled with clear,
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.620]   amber tinted aspect.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:16.980]   Yeah!
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.820]   Waders are pouring wine.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:21.180]   Go tell yourself.
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:23.460]   One by one, we take our seats.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.220]   OK, I'm sorry.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.820]   I can't play them anymore of this because I'm getting hungry.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:27.740]   Andy the Bourdain.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.740]   Medium Rob, Bloody Valentine of the World of Food
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:30.900]   and the People Who Cooked.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.500]   But that's just one.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.140]   We do recommendations every show on the Twitter network.
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:34.900]   We recommend books.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.260]   So if you go back--
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.140]   it's on our wiki.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.180]   Every book we have recommended, there
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.900]   is a page of Leo Laport, 20 Leo Laporte recommendations.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.980]   They're just-- the thing about Audible,
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:44.860]   get the first book.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.020]   Just get it, listen to it, and you can enjoy it
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:48.580]   for the rest of your life.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.100]   It's free.
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:49.580]   It's free.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:50.660]   I'm a big fan.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.740]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:57.060]   Now time for our software or hardware picks.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:01.020]   We do this every week, starting with Alex Lindsey to my left.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.140]   Take a picture.
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.100]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.540]   You're going to recommend the iPhone?
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.980]   Yeah, I'm going to recommend the iPhone.
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:06.500]   OK.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.500]   He's taking a picture of me with his iPhone 4.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:08.780]   Watch this.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.780]   I'm going to take a picture.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.100]   There we go.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:10.620]   There's Leo.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:11.460]   And stay still.
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.900]   Don't move.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:13.700]   Don't move.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:14.900]   You're not going to make me fat, are you?
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.220]   No, no.
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.780]   I'm going to move the camera over here.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.020]   And then I'm going to move it.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.700]   And then I'm going to--
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.220]   I know what you're doing.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.140]   What the hell is he doing?
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:22.660]   And then--
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:23.140]   Same.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:23.980]   And then I didn't move.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:25.140]   He didn't move.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.460]   And then it's going to do this thing.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.380]   And then I go like this.
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.380]   And then--
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.380]   OK, you have to hand it to me so that I can show people how--
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:34.060]   So this is what I just shot.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.020]   What did you do?
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:36.860]   So it's--
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.340]   What?
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:37.940]   It's a 3D messed up.
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:38.780]   Oh, it's-- oh, wait a minute.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.220]   Hold on.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.060]   It's antigliff.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:40.980]   Oh, you've got to go down.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.180]   So I need glasses, right?
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.620]   You do need glasses, but I keep them on my desk now.
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.420]   I don't have any with me.
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:49.500]   But you need glasses, but that's an antigliff.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.340]   You can process it any way you want.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:52.900]   But the idea that you can-- now you can also
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:53.900]   do-- watch this.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:54.900]   Look at this.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.900]   Let me see.
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:56.900]   OK, OK.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:57.900]   There's this little vibe.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:58.900]   That one on.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:29:59.900]   You're so funny.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.900]   There we go.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:01.900]   Let me go.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.900]   OK, give it back.
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:06.900]   Oh, now that's kind of cool because I don't have happened to have red green glasses.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.900]   So if you can't see it, you can kind of see the 3D effect of it.
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:11.900]   Now, what's interesting is what you can do--
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900]   this is called 3D camera.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:13.900]   [HUMMING]
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.900]   I'm sorry I shouldn't do that.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:16.900]   But this is called 3D.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   I feel funny looking at that.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.900]   Stop it.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:19.900]   It's making me--
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:20.900]   You know what?
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:21.900]   We might have some epileptic viewers.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.900]   It's an epileptic, though, you're using the video.
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:27.900]   I do apologize if you're epileptic and you've just been sent into a seizure.
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.900]   It's a fun little application.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:29.900]   Sorry.
[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:31.900]   It's a fun little application.
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:32.900]   Uh-huh, video.
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:34.900]   Yeah, it's excellent.
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.900]   So do you have-- you have to have those red green glasses or antiglid glasses.
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.900]   Or you could do that.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.900]   Well, I don't think that's so cool.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:41.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:46.260]   So the red green glasses are-- you know, you can-- I have a lot of them because I've been
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.260]   doing it too.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.900]   Yeah, I actually have like a dozen of them.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:49.900]   Really?
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:51.860]   Yeah, because you never know when someone's going to go to your house and want to watch
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.860]   the TV.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.860]   And I have a 3D camera.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.860]   You've got to get-- I have a-- I have a-- I have a-- I have a-- that Fuji 3D camera.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.860]   And so I take pictures of 3D all the time.
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:58.860]   Okay.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:30:59.860]   And the idea that the iPhone--
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:00.860]   The-- the--
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:01.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.860]   The app's called 3D Camera.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:03.860]   I said that.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.860]   3D Camera.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.860]   It's so generic that we didn't know.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.860]   And it's not, by the way, this is an unpick.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.860]   It is not-- I'm sorry if you're the developer, but it's not Twinshot 3D, which is not as good
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.860]   as 3D Camera.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:18.860]   So-- because you'll get confused when you do a search for 3D Camera thing on the iPhone.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.260]   But what you do is you take one photo and then you can move it over and here's what you get
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.620]   to do is you get to-- you decide what you want in the center of the frame and you can
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:28.420]   turn it and what you're basically doing is setting up your convergence manually.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:32.660]   So you're setting up your interact-seal distance and your convergence on your own with your
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:35.100]   iPhone and you take these little photos and they're fun.
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:41.140]   You know, there's one way to do a 3D without getting-- spending $600 on a Fuji 3D W1 and
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.140]   which is what I have, but it's--
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:43.140]   That has two lenses.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.140]   That has actually two lenses.
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:47.540]   It's a little easier I have to admit, especially when people are moving.
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:48.540]   And what is Andy showing us?
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:49.540]   Ooh.
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:51.580]   It's also available for the iPad.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:55.020]   So you don't necessarily have to shoot your pictures actually on the iPhone order to make
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.020]   it happen.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:59.140]   If you could just-- it's actually a little bit easier to use I find on the iPad version
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:03.500]   because my trick-- my trickiness when I got the iPhone version was actually getting the
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.700]   photos to line up properly.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:07.940]   I don't think-- I think what they need is they need to have some more tutorials, especially
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:11.660]   on their website, to really show you how to make this sort of work.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:16.980]   Also, they-- I mean, part of it's just the trick of-- or I could get the actual iPhone.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:21.380]   It is just making sure that you keep the camera like sort of steady and that you really just
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:22.380]   slide it horizontally.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:27.860]   So then you're getting this eye and then this eye as opposed to like this and like this.
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:32.100]   So it's a little bit tricky, but for an inexpensive little application that does some really cool
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:37.060]   stuff, especially-- the thing is that you email your friends these pictures and then
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.300]   you say, well, actually, no, actually, I do have some extra glasses here.
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:43.460]   I mean, just give me five bucks to mail them to you because I just need posters and stuff.
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:45.300]   And of course, of course, you'll talk a buck to mail.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.300]   Sorry.
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.100]   Andy, you got to pick for us?
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.940]   I got to pick for you.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:57.140]   There is-- I'm still sort of in the process of finding really, really good iPad stands.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:01.820]   I don't think I've found like the one ring to bind us in United is that it's one device.
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:04.940]   It's a case and easel and a stand all in one.
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:08.820]   And so my favorite thing so far, assuming that you don't want to have my two little rubber
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.900]   stoppers, you carry wherever you go.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:15.540]   And that picture frame plate stand, you get the craft store, works great.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.060]   But it's not really designed for abuse, OK?
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.300]   So over time, like the hinge sort of loosens up.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.300]   So then you have to throw that out by another one.
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:27.300]   So my favorite thing right now is by Griffin technology, it's called the A frame.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.220]   It's a double tasker where--
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:31.180]   This is what you got right here.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.180]   Wow.
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:33.180]   Exactly.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:36.180]   It's made out of like milled machine aluminum like this.
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.180]   And so--
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.180]   It's a medical equipment.
[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:39.180]   Exactly.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.180]   Is it safe?
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:48.180]   So when it's like this, when it's like this, it becomes a typing easel because it's got
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.420]   the slot right here to hold it.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:51.820]   And it actually holds it up at a very nice angle.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:55.740]   I think it also holds it at almost exactly the same angle as my rubber stoppers.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.300]   Maybe it's just a little bit shallower.
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:00.780]   But it's still very, very easy to like sit in front of it like this and get some real
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.780]   typing done.
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:05.100]   But when you want to watch a movie or you want to read a book where you're enjoying
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:09.420]   your favorite burrito, you just kick the stand out and it turns into this.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:11.540]   It is very, very solid for--
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:15.060]   Despite being very, very solid, it's also very, very lightweight.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.100]   It feels as though this thing is not going anywhere.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:20.380]   So long as you're not holding it in midair in front of a camera and trying not to drop
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:24.220]   your own personal iPad 3G, please excuse me if I'm sounding very nervous right now.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:26.260]   But it's rubberized at the bottoms too.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:31.060]   So you're not going to scratch either the iPad or the device itself.
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:34.580]   And something that I like, if you are the sort of person who really does like to have
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:39.340]   some sort of protection on the back, I still have my newer technology clear case with some
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.340]   Japanese paper in the back of it.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:46.300]   It is actually-- this little lip is just thick enough that you can still keep that plastic
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:50.780]   shell or that rubberized shell in there and will still hold it completely securely.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:54.860]   So the good news is that it's a nice thing to travel with, especially if you do a lot
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:55.860]   of writing.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:58.580]   The bad news is it's a slightly pricey item.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.500]   It's 49 bucks.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:07.660]   But if you're looking for something that can replace having like a box full of different
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:11.740]   solutions depending on where you're going or what you intend to be doing with your iPad
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:15.300]   and you want something solid that you feel as though you can actually trust, this might
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:18.180]   be as a one time purchase, a perfectly nice thing to have.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:22.100]   Again, I'm sort of embarrassed that I've had for the past three months, a whole bag full
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:27.100]   of stop gap solutions because I can't find the one thing that really does it for me.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.780]   But this is very, very, very close.
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:30.380]   It looks nice, I have to say.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:31.940]   Again, it doesn't look like a piece of junk.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:37.620]   I'm not necessarily opposed to a $50 or $100 thing.
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:41.980]   So long as when I get it, I feel as though I'm not an idiot for spending 50 bucks for
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:47.260]   this because I'm sure that you will see whether people are copying this design or not, even
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.020]   just coming up with ideas on their own.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:52.180]   You'll see people make something that's sort of similar to this, but it'll probably be
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.500]   flimsy plastic and this will start warping and sort of sharing on you.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:00.540]   And it's not something that you'll feel as though I paid 800 bucks for this iPad.
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:04.620]   So I really want to put it on this cheap piece of junk that costs about 20 bucks to buy
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:06.820]   and probably costs three bucks to manufacture.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:07.820]   Maybe, maybe not.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:10.820]   But this one, once you get in your hands, it's actually available in the Apple store.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.300]   I didn't even know it would exist until I visited the Apple store one day and saw like
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.260]   it does and dozens of these hanging up.
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:20.380]   And so yes, that was me just like perched for like 45 minutes just typing and typing
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:24.900]   and typing just to see if it actually like, you know, seemed like a worthwhile thing.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.100]   So it's a nice object.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.380]   Again, not necessarily for everybody, especially with the price.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:33.380]   But if you're looking for a combined easel and stand, I think this will do the job free
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:34.380]   very nicely.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:38.300]   But in context, Andy, it's only $20 more than your bumper for your iPhone than the piece
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.100]   of crap plastic.
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.580]   Exactly.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:45.940]   So from Griffin available at the Apple store, but also, I'm sure I'm sure Griffin technology
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:46.940]   is online.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.620]   Oh, so it's also slightly, slightly iPhone compatible.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:53.060]   That's not the most useful thing in the world.
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:57.340]   But if you, you know, if you want, you can do your desperate iPhone brace.
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:01.540]   Let's go to our good friend, Frederick Van Johnson from media bites.com for his pick
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.540]   of the week.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.540]   Hello.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.740]   Well, my pick is actually Mac related.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:13.060]   No, I have a, so I've been, I've been doing all this screencast stuff lately.
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.540]   And I know you, you guys have heard of this software before.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:20.980]   It's called ScreenFlow from, I forget the name of the company is, but there's now some,
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:21.980]   there's, it's tell a stream.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:27.020]   There's now some real competition in the screen casting area used to be just a Snapsi Pro was
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.020]   it.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:32.860]   Yeah, but this, this thing, no rendering and screen capture galore.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:38.260]   But the interesting thing about it is I've been using it as an iMovie slash final cut
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.260]   replacement.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:44.980]   I mean, I can, you can edit full on video with this thing, not just screen capture.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:50.100]   You just drag HD clips into it and add transitions and then hit a button and send it straight
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   to YouTube.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:57.540]   And then you just drag it to, to record this, this, the screencast of the, the new This Week
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.540]   and Photo website and put it up there.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:03.460]   And it literally last night took me, I don't know, an hour and a half to record the thing
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.460]   and, and upload.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.460]   And it was done, you know, and it actually came up pretty well.
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:08.460]   Go ahead.
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.460]   That's fine.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:12.460]   Oh, this, hey, you know, it was, it was, that's okay.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.460]   I was, I was going to say, we were, this, we were talking to you.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:17.460]   Look at the site after you.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:19.260]   This is, this is the new, this week, this is our photo site.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.980]   Listen, this is, this is done in WordPress.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:23.980]   Looks beautiful.
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:28.820]   So which is the video that you just most recently did is that click on that top link
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.820]   on the right there.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.820]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:31.820]   Clicked on the wrong one.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:34.140]   Top link, a guided tour of the new Twip.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.780]   So you did a screen, this is a screen capture.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.780]   That's all screen capture.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:41.220]   I captured the video of me talking with, with that.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.500]   That's what I like about this program.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:46.420]   You can inset yourself into it and you can, it has also such a nice transitions and things
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.140]   that day like that.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.580]   That was a screen flow transition.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:50.580]   I recognized it.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:51.580]   I paid for it here.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:56.860]   I just wanted to give you guys a quick tour of the video is just, that was captured with
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:57.860]   the 5D.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:58.860]   Oh, really?
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:38:59.860]   Wow.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:06.380]   I think nowadays we have some amazing video production tools in our, our tool kit here.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:11.060]   This is $99 screen flow from telestream.com and there's also, I mean, there's so many
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:12.060]   good choices.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:13.260]   Have you tried Camtasia?
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.260]   I have.
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.260]   I have.
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.260]   I have.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.260]   And you prefer this to Camtasia?
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.260]   You know, I think there are.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.260]   Look at that.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.260]   That's a nice effect.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:23.260]   Just looking at hairs when you get down to this level.
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.500]   It's just, it's more of a matter.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.940]   It's like, you know, aperture versus light room.
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.940]   They both journaling do the same thing.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:29.940]   Right.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:30.940]   But you can't.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940]   Look at that.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:32.940]   Either one of them.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.940]   They're both 99 bucks, right?
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:36.420]   And these, these effects and that, even that background, these are all very easy to do.
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.980]   You can do a mirrored, you know, drop and stuff.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:39.980]   It's pretty cool.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:40.980]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:41.980]   I like screen flow for a while.
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:42.980]   I have to try it now.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:43.980]   The new 2.1.
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:44.980]   Just came out.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:46.980]   And this weekend photo.com.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.540]   Let's not forget that.
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:50.540]   It's brand new.
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.540]   It's brand new.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.540]   It's beautiful.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.780]   It's very pretty.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.980]   It's a really nice set.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:55.980]   Thank you.
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:56.980]   Thank you.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:58.660]   That doesn't word press, huh?
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.420]   Kind of looks like a Squarespace blog.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:01.580]   Okay.
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:02.660]   You don't have to use Squarespace.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:03.660]   It's okay.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.260]   We can live with that.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:06.260]   Is it my turn?
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.260]   I think it's my turn.
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:08.260]   It's your turn.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:09.260]   I believe it is.
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:13.900]   This is actually a couple of iPhone applications recently at, and I'm sure you guys have all
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:14.900]   tried them.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:17.580]   You know, I thought I'd mention them anyway.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:18.580]   Starting with MapQuest.
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:19.580]   Have you seen the new MapQuest?
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.980]   This is a free mapping application for the iPhone.
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:26.060]   So with turn by turn and street names.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:33.180]   So if you don't want to spend a lot of money on an iPhone app for turn by turn directions,
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.220]   MapQuest for mobile is actually pretty good.
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.820]   The one negative is, as you can see, it doesn't scale very well.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:44.700]   So it's not, it's like they didn't really, well, actually it's looking pretty good now.
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.260]   The Maps aren't, they're not as good as Google Maps.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:48.260]   Let's face it.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:54.140]   But you have turn by turn, you have traffic, you have, you could turn on points of interest.
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:55.540]   You need to be connected, right?
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.540]   It's web-based.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:57.540]   You need to be connected.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.540]   Yep.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:04.820]   I did mention the other one that I like, that Andy likes, the motion X, which has the same
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.820]   thing.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:09.340]   The thing about motion X is that it will cache the maps up to two gigabytes.
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:11.820]   So if you're moving around in the same area, you don't need to be online.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.180]   I don't know about this one.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.340]   I just say, I've been pretty impressed by this.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:17.340]   It's free, right?
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.380]   It will give you the turn by turn.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:21.740]   It will say the street name's out loud.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:22.740]   So that's a good one.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.060]   Another one that is not only a good application, but is in the news is Fring.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.780]   I mentioned this before that it's available for the iPhone now with 3G.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.980]   What does Fring do?
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.500]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.300]   It's a VoIP application, but you can use FaceTime on it over 3G.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.300]   Wow.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:43.260]   However, Skype got pissed off and disconnected.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:45.860]   They said the Fring's violating their rules.
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:48.100]   So Fring was sitting on top of Skype?
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:49.900]   Well, it doesn't have to sit on top of Skype.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:54.420]   It could sit on top of a lot of different things, including MSN and Yahoo and stuff.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:56.940]   You can even make direct calls yourself, but it does use 3G.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:57.940]   It's a 3G voice app.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:01.540]   I don't know, frankly, how they got this past.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.340]   The folks at Apple.
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:06.060]   So download it now before we get it.
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.540]   Everybody can find out how many people at Apple listen to our show.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.540]   Get it now.
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.860]   Facebook, Twitter connections.
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:12.860]   It does VoIP.
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.860]   It has its own VoIP client.
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:17.100]   It's too bad that they no longer have Skype in it.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.060]   I hope they work that out with Skype.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.260]   But here's the point.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260]   FaceTime over 3G.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.600]   It does know the phone.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:27.220]   You can get Fring on a lot of other phones, including the Sprint Evo with the front-facing
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.020]   camera, many Nokia phones.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:33.300]   So this opens up the world of FaceTime to people other than iPhone 4.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.300]   So someone's on a desktop.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:35.300]   Theoretically.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.460]   Ah, I haven't tried that.
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:38.460]   I don't know.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.860]   Can you Fring on a desktop?
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:41.860]   I should mention.
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:43.580]   It does not sound right.
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.580]   Let's Fring everybody.
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:47.220]   You can't be capable of keep falling off.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:49.220]   Everybody Fring.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:56.020]   So I believe it looks like that was launched, didn't look like that, came out of it.
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:43:00.060]   It looks like it's doing the background properly, which Skype does not still do.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.940]   Maybe that's why Skype was peeved.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:02.940]   They should be peeved.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:03.940]   They're way behind.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:05.860]   Yeah, they were on the stage.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:06.860]   They were on stage.
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:08.540]   If you hadn't been on stage, I wouldn't have.
[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:13.380]   I mean, that was a big reason I wanted the OS for was just because I could run Skype in
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:15.660]   the background and now no love.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.060]   Fring can also be used to use Google Voice over 3G.
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:20.900]   So it really does support video.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.900]   FaceTime over 3G.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.900]   Love it.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:27.620]   And I guess there's no Fring for the desktop, but if you're doing a Google Voice or a Yahoo
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:30.540]   or whatever, you would be talking to somebody on the desktop that way.
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:31.540]   Right.
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:32.540]   That's what I'm...
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.540]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.540]   You know what?
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:35.540]   Let's try it.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.540]   We need to get one of those things to do that.
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.540]   One of these things.
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.540]   We can see the cruise Skype.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.540]   We're done with Skype.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:41.540]   I'm shh.
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:42.540]   Don't say that.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.540]   DTM said don't anger it.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:45.540]   We're still in this down.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.540]   Don't anger the Skype God.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:48.540]   That's how we're doing.
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:49.540]   I guess we're still on the show, right?
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.540]   We're still on the show, right?
[01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.540]   It's not like no.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:54.540]   We still have to record a show later.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.540]   I'm going to need Skype.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.540]   Skype is apparently a little prickly.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.540]   Look how good Andy looks with his new camera.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:04.540]   This has been like Cher's Las Vegas show.
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:06.540]   This is my third lighting change since we actually...
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.540]   It's perfect.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:08.540]   It looks great.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:09.540]   Don't change a thing.
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:10.540]   Now it looks great.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.540]   Did you just get your eyebrows done?
[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:13.540]   Because you look marvelous.
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.540]   I should.
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:15.540]   Now I think I should.
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:18.540]   See, the other fun thing is like now we can do cool things like this.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.540]   Ooh!
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:21.540]   Look deeply into his eyes.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:22.540]   Here the buffalo.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.540]   His eyes are green.
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:24.540]   The buffalo is black.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.540]   The letters are yellow.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:29.540]   If these colors don't look right to you, you need to get freeing.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.540]   Look at that.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.540]   That's just horrible.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:37.540]   No, ahh!
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:38.540]   No, actually.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.540]   That's my job.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.540]   No, it looks gorgeous.
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.540]   I have a sort of face that needs to be backed off.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.540]   And look at the backyard and everything.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.540]   Or as they say in Great Britain, the garden.
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:47.540]   It's beautiful.
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:48.540]   Beautiful.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:49.540]   Thank you Andy Enoco for joining us.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:52.540]   Andy is of course the tech guy at Chicago Sun Times.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:56.540]   And his blog is www.cdub.ob.com.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.540]   And joins us every week.
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.540]   Always nice to see you, Andrew.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:00.540]   Always a slice.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:01.540]   Always a slice.
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:04.540]   Mr. Frederick Van Johnson is at mediabats.com.
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.540]   He is a photographer.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.540]   He does this week in photography.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:09.540]   And you can go to thisweekinphoto.com.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:10.540]   That's not it.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:15.540]   That brand new website where it's lovely and always sunny.
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.540]   And always great photography advice.
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:19.540]   Good show.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:21.540]   Now that I have the GH1, I'm going to have to start listening.
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.540]   Have you covered the GH1, Frederick, in the end?
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:27.540]   We have not, but we certainly will, especially if I can get my hands on one.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:28.540]   You know anybody with one?
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:31.540]   Yeah, Alex.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:32.540]   Ask Alex.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:33.540]   Come to the office for the test tomorrow.
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:34.540]   Come to the office.
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.540]   I will.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.540]   I will come up.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:39.540]   Alexlindzepixacore.tv for the podcast, pixacore.com.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:43.540]   For that great guild of multimedia artists who are learning and working together.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:45.540]   We're streaming tomorrow.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:46.540]   So what does that mean?
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.540]   Go to pixacore.com tomorrow.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.540]   But also, if you follow me on Twitter, just Alexlindziel.
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:53.540]   I'll post it when we're doing it.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.540]   But we're probably going to stream almost all day.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.540]   We're going to be shooting 4K Mac brakes.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.540]   We're going to be shooting 4K Mac brakes because we can.
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.540]   You know, because you know, you do not.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.540]   We got to test it.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.540]   We got, oh I forgot to mention that.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:05.540]   That's the story.
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:06.540]   You too.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.540]   You too.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:08.540]   So YouTube's doing 4K.
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:11.540]   So we're going to do a couple Mac brakes in 4K just to test.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:13.540]   Just the time is double.
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:14.540]   It's the new 2K.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.540]   Horizontal and width of high depth.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.540]   So it's four times higher resolution.
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.540]   And you have a 4K camera, a red.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.540]   We've a red.
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:23.540]   So Kelly.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:24.540]   Kelly, all in one truck.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:25.540]   He's going to bring his red.
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:28.820]   And so what you're going to see when you see a stream is you're going to see us recording
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:30.540]   those, setting up for it, getting ready for it.
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.940]   We'll stop and talk to people a little bit about it.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.100]   And but we're, you know, we're just kicking the tires.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.100]   We're having some fun.
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:37.100]   We know that it's a little over the top.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:38.820]   So you don't have to tell me that right now.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.540]   But first of all, you can never go.
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.300]   Anyway, so anyway, so the, we're going to go a little over the top and do some 4K Mac
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.300]   brakes.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.300]   So hopefully we'll be able to release the following week.
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:49.300]   4K.
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:50.300]   And YouTube's going to support this.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:51.300]   They already do it.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:53.180]   With what kind of bandwidth are you going to need to look at it?
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.180]   A lot.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.940]   And more than a telephone connection.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:56.940]   Is it true 4K?
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:57.940]   No.
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:46:58.940]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:46:59.940]   But my screen isn't even that high risk.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.260]   If you had a cinema display, you can watch it.
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:04.140]   It's going to be one by, it's going to be one to one.
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.860]   We're going to put a cinema display up that we're going to capture from.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:08.260]   And then you're going to see us one to one.
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:12.300]   And so if you watch it on a cinema display, it will use every pixel that you hand.
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.300]   You need what a four megabit connection.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:17.060]   Yeah, you know, every more or patience, patience.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]   Just download it.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.060]   Just download it overnight.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.060]   It's going to be downloadable.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.420]   Or you can hit killing start.
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.620]   You're killing me because there was a time when I could just come downstairs.
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:29.540]   I didn't have to shave and I'd have to change that to my teacher.
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:30.540]   That's getting worse.
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:31.540]   Okay, we're doing video fine.
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.900]   So I'm shaving and putting on clothes.
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:34.220]   And I'll upgrade the camera.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.020]   So now I have to look good clothes.
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:38.460]   Now for the 4K cameras, I'm going to need a makeup person.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:40.420]   Or at least I'm going to need like a stand in.
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.420]   So here.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:46.980]   So 240, 360, 480, 720, 1080p, and then an original.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.140]   An original is a 4K video, which I won't be able to play.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.100]   It'll have to downscale it for my screen, right?
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.460]   And basically that's what you're going to see is a completely frozen shot that barely
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.100]   plays.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:04.460]   Unless you work at the NSA, you do not have enough bandwidth to see any of these videos.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:06.540]   So and these would have to be shot with a red.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.780]   Nothing else does 4K right now.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.340]   Oh, there's other things to do for.
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:13.020]   But the red is the most the obvious choice to do that.
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.100]   And now that I've downloaded it, if I rewind, I should get it without stuttering.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   No, because it's still too high resolution for me to play.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.100]   I'll figure a little laptop.
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:20.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:21.100]   I'm going to do a little laptop.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.100]   I'm just going to break it down and record it.
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.100]   Now, you need to get the next--
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:29.740]   Hey, all I want to say is that when we did for play when we did 1080p, I know we did Mac
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:31.460]   break at 1080p and nobody could watch it.
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:33.380]   And people and people thought we were insane.
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:36.540]   And now there's lots of people doing HD like HD is now on the web.
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.980]   We're just, you know, four or five years ahead of time.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:42.340]   You thought you enjoyed videos of squirrels eating peanut butter on a coconut shelf in
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.340]   the backyard now?
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.340]   Yeah, baby.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.340]   Wait till you get to see it in 4K.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.340]   Yeah, baby.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:49.740]   And we're going to when we'll talk about this camera and the interface to this.
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:50.740]   So the GH1.
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:51.740]   The GH1.
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.380]   Fred Rook will come up and do the show with me, right, Fred?
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.380]   Okay, Fred, you're going to come up into the morning.
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:58.980]   You're going to have to be here early to get to it.
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:48:59.980]   So anyway, so--
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:00.980]   We're 11.
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:01.980]   Is it honest?
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:02.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:04.540]   We're going to be shooting at nine.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:09.860]   So anyway, we're going to-- but we'll talk about this and the interface to it, to the,
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:13.980]   you know, to the Black Magic intensity card and whether we're getting uncompressed and
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.540]   how it looks and everything else.
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.540]   And we'll do that tomorrow streaming.
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:20.260]   And so you definitely want to check that out and we're going to record it in 4K and then
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:24.580]   we'll put it up on YouTube just because we can.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.220]   Just because we can.
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.900]   All your nerd parts are tingling right now.
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:29.700]   I can tell all the way from here.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.260]   It was so excited.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:35.860]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for joining us for this week's Mac Break Weekly.
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:37.180]   We encourage you to come back again.
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:42.460]   We do it live so you can see the full unedited, unexpergated version, including public nudity.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:50.660]   Tuesday 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time 1800 UTC at live.twit.tv or subscribe, download,
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:56.820]   and watch your convenience at Twit.tv/MBW.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.300]   We are not in 4K, but we do have video.
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:01.320]   It's not even high def, really.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:03.140]   In fact, I'm almost embarrassed.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:04.140]   It's color.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.940]   Almost embarrassed.
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:07.140]   And that's only recently, even.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.140]   Yeah, really.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:12.860]   I'm embarrassed to mention it, but we have audio, video, text, or.
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:17.180]   Special color acetate overlays on top of your screen in order to get our form of color.
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:18.900]   But still, we're making the effort.
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:19.900]   We're trying.
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.340]   We're doing our best.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:23.900]   We thank Andy Guzman, who stopped by from Reno to join us.
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:24.900]   There's Andy.
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:25.900]   There's Andy.
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.100]   Stop by to Reno from Reno to Drones and Pete Quadrio.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:29.860]   That's how you say it.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.180]   Who's from visiting from Australia?
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.180]   We're in Australia.
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:33.820]   Sydney, Australia.
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.820]   He has a bus pass.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:35.820]   So watch out.
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:36.820]   That's what it says here.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:37.820]   Bus pass.
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:40.580]   I guess he's going to travel all over the coast.
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:41.580]   He's not here illegally.
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:42.580]   He's not here illegally.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.580]   He's a fucking classic.
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:44.580]   That's right.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:45.580]   You're off of a visa.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:46.580]   And you brought somebody in, Brian.
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:49.180]   Brian, from Salesforce, from Salesforce.com.
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:53.780]   Brian is looking at this and going.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.060]   This is just crazy talk.
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:57.060]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.060]   We'll see you next week.
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:59.060]   Now get back to work.
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:50:59.060]   Break times over.
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:02.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:05.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:09.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:12.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:15.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:15.900]   [music ends]
