[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:25.000]   Alex has a really good point about the new Apple TV you're going to want to listen to because you may want to upgrade some other hardware as well.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.440]   And then we'll talk about Apple's iMessages and why it's not on Android.

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.560]   We're still on lockdown.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   The border is teamwork.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.840]   Can't go anywhere.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.160]   I'm going to watch the shots until end of June and I think we're better off than Australia.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.360]   Please live for us, Leo.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.240]   Live for us.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.480]   I shall tell your story.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.880]   Sorry, I'm getting my second shot tomorrow, which means and then I'm coming into work.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120]   So you can watch me slowly turn green.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.800]   It'll be great.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.200]   Which one are you getting, Leo?
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.680]   I got Moderna number for the first one and Moderna for the second.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.600]   That's apparently the good one.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.880]   That's like the very good thing.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.360]   Jay and Jay Johnson, Johnson's been pulled out of the off the market.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.120]   That's what John got.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.400]   That's what Jason Howell got.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.960]   That's what a lot of our team got.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.120]   That's Andy and not co.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.480]   Are you did you get the shot yet, Andrew?
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080]   I got shot number one last week, too, Pfizer.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.600]   So I'll be in three weeks time.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.280]   I will be able to go back to licking door handles and so exciting and not and not not
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.840]   not boiling, but not not having my take out food have to wait outside for 24 hours
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.600]   to make sure that whatever virus is on there.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.240]   It's kind of funny because.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.040]   Renee, it is like Pokemon team Moderna.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.760]   Team Pfizer.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.640]   Team J and J.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.400]   Oh, I've been doing a mask in 2025.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.080]   See you guys soon.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.160]   There was a great, great video, a great sketch on the late late show with Seth Meyers,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.360]   or excuse me, this whatever late night with Seth Meyers.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.040]   That was like about all the different vaccines, like in the waiting room being
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.480]   interviewed for auditioning for being like the all of them, all of them were like,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.080]   Oh, get out of here with your 65% come on.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.400]   And that is that my goodness is Alex Lindsey, office hour of office.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.000]   Hours fame from the nine oh media on.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.760]   I know that media.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.440]   We're we're we're slowly moving into cooking as well.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.840]   We're out of that office hours.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.000]   So, you know, the portfolio, the portfolio is first, it was like how to make video,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.760]   how to make audio, how to do production.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.280]   Then it changed a little bit.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.200]   You would start doing music, then it changed a little bit more.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.000]   You started to do Raspberry Pies, then it changed a little bit more.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.200]   Now you're doing cooking.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.960]   So on Saturday, we started with we started with a discussion about education.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.760]   Then we did an hour and a half of Unreal Engine development.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.240]   And then then we switched in cooked corn fritters and then we and then we
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.440]   built another Raspberry Pi.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.520]   So that was about.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.080]   So that was a pivoted to show that I had a friend that that saw it.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.120]   I told him you should go check out the Raspberry Pi thing and he checked it out
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.240]   and he goes nine hours.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.520]   You guys went for nine hours.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.040]   I said, yeah, that was a short episode.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.840]   That was just no, that was just the show.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.040]   It didn't include the pre show or the pre pre show or the call.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.680]   They used to call Walter Cronkite old iron butt because he could sit through
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.320]   Apollo hold for hours and, you know, fill with a, they didn't have then.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.680]   They didn't have CGI or anything yet.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.880]   A model of the Apollo.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.760]   Although you'll see the inside.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.440]   You're you're iron butt squared.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.360]   I, you know, the, the fun thing is just, it's just, it's just such a great group to hang out with.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.040]   So it's, we just have a lot of fun.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.400]   And, you know, the experiment really is just how to do interact, how to learn together.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.680]   And because we have all this gear, because we have all this hardware, we're able to, I mean, it was, it was multi camera
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.920]   cooking from everybody's kitchen.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:59.880]   So there's like 15 people with two or three cameras each that are all like cutting the closeups in our, in our, um, uh, our, our cook that was, it was guidance along to
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.960]   Don D'Amunty Gajar from South Africa is, is she's walking us through one of her recipes and we're all making it together and showing it to each other and asking questions.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.600]   And it was remarkably fun.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.920]   You know, it was, it was a really fun way to learn how to, how to cook.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:24.400]   Uh, I think there's something missing in, in the fast, not just TikTok, but, but in the fast one, uh, anything on TV where it's all just kind of pre done.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:36.240]   There's something about just doing it and discussing it that is, um, it's really powerful, but it would be hard to do without a whole bunch of people that already have all the tech because it would be bad audio and bad cameras and bad lighting.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.920]   And this, in this case, like we have lighting rigs and I have, you know, we have wireless mics and headsets and, you know, all kinds of stuff to tie in.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.040]   So it's, it's a really interesting kind of, I think glimpse of the future.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.600]   By the way, it was a different era.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.880]   They didn't call them iron, but they call them iron pants.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   Oh, there you go.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.400]   Cause you can't say, but, um, all right.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.800]   Mm.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.200]   Let's talk about the invite.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.800]   Did you get it?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.080]   Who wants that mean?
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.960]   Nobody sent me an invite either.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.720]   Actually, I don't know.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.080]   When you were on office hours, how do you know?
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.040]   You have a check, man.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.960]   Check your mail, man.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.920]   Check your mail.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.840]   Um, so, so, uh, tell us Renee Renee, because obviously they invited you.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.960]   What are we talking here?
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.160]   Um, first it started to be with Siri women.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.800]   Like, yes, have you tried this?
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.920]   Have you trist?
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.080]   So what do I ask her?
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.880]   It might.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   So they had to break it so that people wouldn't see it early.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.480]   And now it hasn't been fixed on time.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.640]   So it may not answer, but you just ask when the next Apple event is.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.440]   When is the next Apple event?
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.080]   She's thinking thinking.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.040]   Oh, now it says, but it didn't say it out loud.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.520]   The special event is Tuesday, April 20th at Apple Park.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.360]   It does the importance.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.720]   So if you ask, if you use the command word, it'll say it out loud.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.880]   But if you hold down the button, it thinks, okay, so let me, let me, I can do this.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.080]   Meeting my mic here with it.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.120]   When is the Apple event?
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.400]   No, especially event is on Tuesday, the 20th of April at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.120]   Nice.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.360]   Get all the details on Apple.com.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   Thank you, Siri.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.400]   I mean, I love the scene to use for Siri.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.480]   I just noticed I'm using the South African one.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   Yes, me.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.440]   If I worked on that team, I would be, I would have been working.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.920]   I would be embarrassed that my team had screwed that up, but also saying, OK, we got to come up with something funny for Siri to say whenever, like someone asked them, ask her,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   about the Apple event.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.800]   So I got in trouble the last time I answered the question.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.600]   I'm sure you know, Siri as a team of writers, I'm sure they're working on it right now.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:51.280]   But I mean, it happens in his famous like developers famously have just said, release it on this day, not thinking that it's going to go live at 12 O one AM Australia time.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.200]   You have to set a day and a time to make sure it's a or PM, you know, there's so many things can go wrong.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.520]   When you that's why I never upload instead of time where I always do everything manually.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.960]   It gets so paranoid after a while about him, bar goes.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.360]   The last Apple invitation I got was November 2nd, 2020.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.440]   So I guess I'm off the list.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.040]   It's not really because it's a virtual event.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.720]   It's not like they just send out emails to people on their list.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.160]   But like it's on apple.com.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.800]   So we're as october and November's.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.960]   I in other words, I was I was getting them, but not anymore.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.720]   So that's OK.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.040]   Unless it's in junk.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.360]   So if I go to Apple, it could be in junk mail.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.920]   It could be.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.080]   Let them get in your head, Leo.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   Don't let them get in my head.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.520]   Don't let them live rent free.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.440]   They're getting in my head.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.520]   Where would I see this?
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.840]   Is it scroll down?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.880]   Scroll down the whole page.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.960]   Yeah, Academy Award nominee.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.880]   No, Apple event under that.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.800]   What is that Apple?
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.760]   That is interesting.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.360]   What is that?
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.160]   Yeah, that's I think that's the first hint.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.920]   If you look, if you look at the world, it actually spells out O L E.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.920]   So I think they're going to be they're going to be ditching open doc for Microsoft object.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.760]   Oh, hey, and everybody's using cyber dog.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.080]   You might have to find a new platform.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.040]   So what Renee thought it was a for Apple for iPad Pro 5.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.720]   You know, I'm reading into the tea leaves too much here.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.240]   It looks like the first two letters of Leo, I'm going to say.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.960]   But OK, what is the what is the text on the invite?
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.800]   Because this on the page, it doesn't have any text.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.640]   It says what is.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.360]   Oh, it's.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.080]   Yeah, so this one is spring, spring loaded, spring loaded.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.600]   Oh, I get it.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.240]   It's a spring and this is.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.960]   Yeah, 2015 was spring forward.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.840]   And so now 2021 has to be spring loaded because the event is going to be loaded, Leo.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.680]   Does that OK?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.800]   So that's a question, I guess.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.560]   That's the only word we can parse.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.680]   Or you have to be loaded to afford the stuff.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.280]   What?
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.480]   So that sounds like maybe they're going to announce a lot of things.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.680]   Clear the deck before dubbed up.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.360]   So I've been my I guess conventional wisdom is this will be this Tuesday, by the way, 10 AM Pacific.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   We will be here covering it and then go right into Mac break weekly afterwards.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.640]   If they keep to an hour, it'll be perfect.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:13.480]   My my guess is that it's going to be iPad, that new iPad Pro with the mini LED screen.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.160]   It's going to be air tags, maybe and a big question,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.520]   month maybe an Apple TV.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.400]   Anything there was a rumor, maybe a new mini Apple iPad mini.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.960]   But no Max, right?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.400]   What do you think it could be there could be Max?
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.440]   I mean, it's so confusing because a lot of people assumed air tags finally, because
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.360]   they've been rumored since early 2019, but then Apple announced they find my network
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.720]   with those accessories, one of which is basically an air tag.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   You know, they're not basically an air tag and a pair of air pods at that event.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.800]   People were anticipating air tags and air pods at this event.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.200]   So I think the iPad Pro is as close to a short thing as we have.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.680]   A lot of people want the updated Apple TV because we've been waiting a long time for
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.760]   that and then AirPods 3 and air tags are on deck.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.880]   And some of them acts maybe because, you know, we've been waiting on the higher,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.320]   higher and less power efficient, more powerful.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.800]   The 16 and Mac book pro, right?
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.240]   That might this might be a time.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.120]   That's the one I want.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.240]   I would take that today.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.920]   My my thing.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.560]   Conventional wisdom thinking is that's for June.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.480]   That's for that would be typical.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.360]   See, right?
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.800]   I think I think that they're they're holding off on a major restyling.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.000]   And remember that there's a rumor that the touch bars is is Gishfinkdo.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.720]   So I think that when they when they really do the first big push of Apple
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.760]   Silicon, they're going to try to do it every time in new styling, new designs to
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.240]   really, really hammer in the fact that this is something brand new.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.160]   Remember that when the stuff that came out last year was essentially proof of
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.280]   concept, extremely successful and usable proof of concept.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.920]   But it was okay to simply say, okay, here's stuff that we've already had the
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.560]   machining for.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.080]   Now we're going to be putting new chips in there.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.000]   This is the augmented reality.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.680]   As always, if you point your phone at the invite, you'll get and Jaws posted this,
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.320]   by the way, spring has come to the Apple campus.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.360]   It is looking a lot prettier than it did when they were building it, right?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.640]   Is that a real app or is that a model?
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.520]   Could be a model, huh?
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.600]   I think it's real.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.200]   So this is the spring.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   I think that there's no reason for it not to be real.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.040]   The spring is springing and it turns into an Apple.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.880]   That's not that cool.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:26.040]   Well, I wonder whether the reason that it's there, though, is that whether the pen
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.000]   and the iPad with LIDAR let you interact with the, like in 3D with the world.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.760]   That's could be kind of interesting.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.240]   I like that.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.200]   That's my speculation.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.280]   I'm, you know, it's best I can do.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.280]   The colors, maybe it's the colors of the new iMacs.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.800]   It's the lime and the tangerine and the grape.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.160]   And I'll be very, it'll be interesting to see if if the Apple TV goes anywhere.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.280]   There's rumors that it'll be 120 Hertz.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.120]   I'd love that.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.120]   20 frames per second.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.560]   I'd love that.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.280]   Now people talk about that related to the games, but one of the other things to
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.840]   think about is that with a content pipeline that Apple has and with phones
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.920]   that are capable of shooting that, you know, you could push Apple can probably
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.440]   push 120 faster and harder as a format than anyone else.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   You're right.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.200]   And so everything on Apple TV plus and everything you bought in iTunes and
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   it may not be everything.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.560]   And they may leave film at 24, which is
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.080]   stuff, you know, how much stuff is shot at 120?
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.480]   Nothing.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:26.920]   Nothing.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.480]   Not nothing, but very, very little.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.960]   The, the big advantage is that, well, 120 is really interesting because it's
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.440]   evenly divisible by 24 30 and 60.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   So all of our formats that we use right now are, we'll fit into it.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   And one of the things that would be really interesting to see is if you did
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.440]   120, you may want to be able to, and I don't know whether you could put a chip,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.400]   I think, into something like an Apple TV and interpolate the motion blur back
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.720]   from 120 to 24.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.320]   So theoretically, you could shoot a movie at 120 frames per second and then
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.760]   watch it at 24 and we still have all the same motion blur.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.640]   Still feel like like 24 frames a second, but you could turn it off and it could
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.480]   be 120.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.120]   Now I think the 120 is way more interesting for things like nature,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:19.640]   documentaries, you know, sports, sports, it gets super interesting to see that.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.040]   Anything a lot of action is better at a higher frame.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   Right.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.360]   That's what the iPad Pro does now.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.280]   Like the iPad Pro, they call it Pro Motion because it's not a fixed 120 hertz.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.880]   It's dynamic and it'll go up to 120 hertz for Apple pencil or for scrolling.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.760]   And then it'll go to 48 hertz for 24 frames per second movie and then or at 60
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.880]   hertz for 30 frames per second television and then down to 24 hertz to conserve power.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.840]   But I went and watched a bunch of science documentaries on this and they were,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.920]   they were using the green diode test to see how fast we can actually see.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.560]   And they're like, when we get to like 480 hertz, that'll start to approach the human
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.360]   capacity.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.240]   So it's just until then as these incremental steps forward to get closer.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.720]   That's good to know.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:03.560]   Um, iOS 14, five will come out along with TV, OS, iPad, OS and whatever else.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:11.320]   And according to a nine to five Mac, the beta code in TV, OS 14, five suggests 120
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:11.920]   hertz.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.040]   And the thing, the thing to look at there though, is that if Apple actually
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.520]   decided to push that it would, no one else can do that right now.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.640]   This gets back into Apple constantly doing things that, that are really
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.280]   uncomfortable for everybody else.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.400]   Um, so because they have the entire pipeline from acquisition to, um, to
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.120]   playback to all the other things, and again, that's them continually coming
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.400]   back to areas that they can innovate where no one else can easily.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   And so suddenly if there's a whole, but now a lot of people have tried to do
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.080]   high frame rate and hasn't been successful.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.240]   So maybe it will just be, maybe they won't do it.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.480]   Maybe it won't be successful.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.920]   But if they were successful at it, it means that all of your other stuff is
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.400]   and you'll notice it, like after you watch 120 frames a second, a lot, which I
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.080]   have for weeks on end and, uh, it, everything just looks framey.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.960]   You get used to it.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.520]   Well, why don't you get used to it?
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.880]   24 looks really framey.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.160]   Right.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.600]   Well, we saw Disney plus and TV plus came out with high frame rate HDR before
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.880]   any of the other streaming services.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.640]   And it was night and day compared to what Netflix was doing, even at 4K HDR.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.520]   And then everyone had to raise their game and then they'd have to keep doing
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.080]   that with everything else as part of the image.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.160]   And it's going to be a big deal once sports networks who definitely want to be
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.480]   making money by selling extended packages to consumers to say that here is,
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   here is, uh, here is football basketball in at 30 frames per second, regular HD.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.920]   Here it is at 120 frames per second.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.080]   And I think about all the people all the times that what a big boost HD was once
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.240]   all the games start being broadcast in high definition, that was the trigger
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.280]   point for a lot of people to finally spend thousands of dollars on panels that
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.840]   weren't quite up to snuff just yet.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.400]   But the difference with the experience was so much better.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.920]   This could be something that would be the breakthrough for first, for streaming life
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.320]   sports.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.800]   It definitely could be the challenge really is, I don't know of any truck that's
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.640]   built for 120 frames per second.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.760]   So it would, it would take an entirely new launch forward to get that working.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.280]   Um, but you could capture footage right now at 120 and play it out.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.920]   So that gets back into nature style things and maybe even NFL films style ideas,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.520]   although NFL films really is 23, nine, eight, most of the time,
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.480]   kisses all the time.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.200]   It's that beautiful dreamy thing.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:30.280]   It was a cold December day in Lambo field when Brent Favre took the, you know, it's
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   not for Vince Lombardi and his green Bay Packers.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.960]   That would be another day.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.760]   Exactly.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.000]   So you want that dreamy on some things.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.680]   In fact, uh, some movies should be dreamy, I think.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.200]   And 24 is perfect for that.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.560]   Um, I hope I don't, my eyes don't get ruined by 120.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.920]   And I say, Oh, this looks for me.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.520]   I don't like it anymore.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.440]   And it wears off the effect wears off, but it never goes completely away.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.320]   You can now see the frames all the time.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.400]   It's, it's hard.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.920]   You raise an excellent point, which is that somebody's got it.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.760]   It's a catch 22 and somebody's got to start the ball rolling.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.480]   So, uh, aside from movie theaters, which some have that capability, very few, uh,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.440]   effective, which is much easier, hand full.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.680]   It's much easier to do it if you have it.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.200]   And but more and more TV sets have 120.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.160]   Uh, in fact, I mean, very inexpensive TV sets have 120.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.120]   What do you need?
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.320]   Static 120 isn't hard.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.640]   It's the dynamic 120.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.000]   That's the dynamic for film.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.040]   They're going to be static.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.560]   They're going to shoot a lot of the frame rate and show it at that frame.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.960]   A lot of the, a lot of the TVs go up to 240.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.760]   The issue is that that's interpolation.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.600]   That's not it.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.200]   So when people say, Oh, it looks very video-y.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.760]   Well, yeah, it's, it's adding a whole bunch of frames.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.440]   It's adding five frames for every frame or 10 frames for every frame.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.400]   Of course it's going to look video.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.480]   That's going to be another problem.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's all soft.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   That's going to be another problem is that people say, Oh, I have, you know, 120,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.520]   but it's no, it's interpolated 120.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.720]   Um, you want a 120.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.480]   You're going to get the whole chain to work, Alex.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.520]   You just need, you just need a TV that'll support the 120.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.640]   You need an Apple TV that supports 120 if they do that.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.760]   And then you need, I believe, an HDMI 2.1.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.120]   Uh, uh, HDMI.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.680]   So you know, that's, and then I mean, that's for the, for the video.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.520]   The other problem is, okay, let's say you have a surround sound system.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.200]   You need an AVR that can pass 120 frames a second through it.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.000]   Um, and that's ensure that it'll actually be capable of managing that.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.480]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.880]   That'd be the other challenge.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:28.640]   So if I have my, uh, my system connected via arc, so it's getting the HDMI back,
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.720]   that's when it would be getting, but it would need to be, it would need to be
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.120]   able to support 2.1, a full, a full support of HDMI 2.1 to pass through, which,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.640]   if I did it by an optical cable, would that's the same problem or no?
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.080]   Uh, no, it's not the optical cable.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.120]   It's the, the, well, you can do it either way.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.560]   You can have it through arc or you can have it through an optical cable,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.720]   pass back into your AV.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.840]   I bet it's the same because all they're going to do is split the signal.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.560]   Yeah, the optical, an optical cable.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.400]   I don't think that does the new, do the new Apple TVs have one.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.800]   No, no, no out of the TV.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.440]   So it goes into the TV, goes in the TV via HDMI 2.1.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.400]   Then optical out to that one and then use optical out of the TV.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.600]   The TV would have to down res it to 60.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.960]   For optical out, right?
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.840]   Otherwise you know, no, no, if you could optical out just the audio.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.760]   Yeah, the optical out is, I don't think frame in PCM.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.720]   It's not.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.120]   It's not.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.160]   OK, so that so that might be a.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.720]   Yep.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.120]   The only reason I ask is somebody's going to call the radio show and say, well,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.920]   the content, Leo, it's like, remember when we saw the Hobbit at 60 frames per
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.200]   second, yeah, no, I didn't like it.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.600]   Blinds and like it.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.400]   And then like it's not like it's just the content wasn't there yet.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.480]   But that was upscaled, wasn't it?
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.760]   I was at shot at 120.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.360]   It was shot at 60.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.800]   Maybe, you know, and I don't know.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.920]   I mean, like it's this still pretty much we're still talking about a long shot.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.840]   But what I will say is that if Apple went down that path,
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.040]   it has incredible ramifications in the sense that if everyone starts watching
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.920]   120 frames per second at home, going to the theater will get really messed up.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.680]   Like it will it will not work for people.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:00.600]   If you get used to watching HDR 4K 120 frames a second with 7.1 or 7.12 or whatever,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.440]   you're not the theaters aren't going to be like most theaters are not going to keep up.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.560]   I'm not good.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.520]   I'm not so sure for a couple of reasons.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:16.480]   One that the your local theater is is absolutely that friend of yours who will buy
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   the latest of everything and we can go to absolutely see everything
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.080]   as best possible presentation.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.400]   Is it?
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.720]   So, so what theater are you going to?
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.600]   I go to I don't I don't go to drive ins.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.680]   I go to certified theaters that have screens that are much bigger than than 50
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.160]   inches, which is the one that I've got.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.920]   But we have a run co projectors. They've spent $40,000 on that don't do that don't
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.560]   do 120.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.160]   They're going to have to replace those.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.440]   Right.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   But so so if they just once they if they decide that they need to compete by giving
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.280]   people the best experience, particularly in these like event movies, like the
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.560]   Marvel movies where you can you can barely follow the action as it is.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.920]   But if you've got more frames, the more frames in there, maybe you will be able
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.160]   to understand it a little bit funny.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.960]   But but the other quickly, the only other thing is that I'm not 100% convinced that
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.040]   high frame rate is great for everything.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.480]   I'm not sure that I'm not sure that an intimate drama would be enhanced by high
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.560]   frame rate, you know, you need to get you need to get into that sort of dreamy
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.520]   spike, ladies latest hack.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:24.760]   You know, the five bluzz was shot on a area Alexa at a high frame rate, I think,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.600]   because it was hyper real.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.240]   And it bothered me a little bit.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.240]   And I liked the dreamy 24 frames.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.920]   But what it sounds like, what Alex is saying is you may not like because it's
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.960]   only because we're conditioned.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.320]   It's you may not like it.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.560]   What's your condition to 120?
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:44.800]   It is like I just will say that eight that the stuff that I've seen that's eight
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.840]   K one 20 HDR or H your 10 and the home.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.760]   Since that I was looking at it's like looking through a window.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.520]   It is like looking through a window.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.120]   It is literally like your your your and if the here's the interesting thing is
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.800]   that it when it's completely full app, like you can't see anything else, your
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.440]   stomach will pull in when the camera moves.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.600]   Like your brain is not a my brain isn't able to distinguish what it's looking
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.120]   at anymore.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.640]   So it does create new problems to Andy's point that you're you're not.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.760]   It's your brain is no longer saying, Oh, this is just a movie.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.920]   It is caught up in experiencing what's there.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.720]   So I think that what it opens up for is a different kind of content that that is
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.480]   going to be, you know, could be experiential, could be still storytelling in
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.880]   movies, but maybe not the traditional film.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.880]   And, you know, it'll be interesting to see as we get out of this, what
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.400]   traditional film looks like, you know, we're seeing, you know, Marvel is
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.440]   really successfully and Disney is really successfully, you know, stretching
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.040]   stories out over five or six hours, as opposed to
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.960]   sex to two hours to yeah.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.720]   Well, I mean, he's doing all one movie, but there's but but the but I think
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.960]   I think that I'm I'm enjoying I'm enjoying a lot of these longer, like
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.520]   multi, you know, six episode eight.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.640]   But that's the other thing we're getting in condition to and is is exactly right.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.960]   Storytelling over a much it starts to feel a little constrained.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.880]   Oh, I got to fit it into a 90 minute or 120 minute arc.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.640]   That's that's going to be a very how did you get the Hobbit in that?
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.800]   Oh, we made three movies.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.920]   So I agree with you.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.680]   Just the psychology of streaming over cinema, because you have to tell
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   stories very differently when people can switch networks.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.440]   Like that's why I don't care about the theater, but they can switch so fast at home.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.240]   You got to you got to treat them like a YouTube video and get their attention and hook them.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.280]   I don't want to.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.200]   I think I do think that for the audience might be a good idea.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.400]   I do think that that will will end up seeing a lot less screens, but a lot higher
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.600]   quality to Andy's point is that I don't think they can afford to upgrade 12 or 15,000
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.240]   screens, but they're going to afford to do 2,000 screens and it's time.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.920]   The only thing worth watching is I'm accent.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:49.200]   Artlight cinemas in Pacific theaters, big Hollywood movie companies have closed the
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.920]   parent companies handing the keys back to the landlord.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.360]   And you've probably seen this cinema, a dome very famous in Hollywood.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.760]   In fact, it was featured in the most recent.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   It was interstellar there.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.840]   Oh, it'd be good to see interstellar there.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.120]   That would be really beautiful.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.600]   It's a it's sad.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.480]   That's a cinema.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.400]   So that's a super wide screen.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.560]   It's a weird aspect ratio, but that's the thing.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.240]   You know, you say your neighborhood theater is going to upgrade it.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.480]   You know, they're barely able to keep a float at this point.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.200]   But can I say there's also another element that there is a there is part
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.560]   there's something about cinema that is a shared experience.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.160]   And the shared experience of going on Twitter later on and talking about it to
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.960]   other people in the world is qualifies.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.600]   But there is my greatest memories of going of seeing movies really aren't about
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.080]   being alone in my in my living room or even with a couple of friends, my
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.520]   living room.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:51.560]   It is it is being in the Harvard Square cinema with 350 people watching the big
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:51.880]   night.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   And at the moment where where they cut into they cut into the Tempo.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.240]   You know that that incredible like Italian entree that they've been working up to
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.960]   for the entire for the entire movie.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   And they they lift up a slice of it and you see this cross section of eggs and
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.200]   sausage and pasta and just a major thing and 350 people myself included suddenly
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.400]   went.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:19.240]   Oh, and then and then we all burst out laughing, realizing what had just happened.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.200]   That's the sort of stuff I'm talking about.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.720]   I hope that there will always that that's an intrinsic part of the film
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.240]   experience and that there will be people and companies that still think that that's
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.000]   a valuable thing.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.920]   But I think there's there's definitely going to be theaters.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.960]   I just don't know how many.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.480]   Yeah, like it's not.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.920]   It's not.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.280]   I think that that's the real question.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.080]   I think we I think we're going to end up at 2000 screens and either there were
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.520]   people who said, I love the smell of horse manure in the morning and means I'm
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.280]   going to work.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.560]   There were people who said, I can't wait to hold the newspaper in my hands and get
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   that smell of that ink on my fingers.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.160]   I mean, just because you and everybody else says, Oh, we love that shared
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.400]   experience doesn't mean it's going to survive, unfortunately.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.560]   You know, that's, you know, it's economics.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.520]   And actually at this point, if 120 Hertz becomes huge, I think people are going
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.800]   to get used to it in the home.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.920]   And it might even be worse for movie theaters because we're going to have
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.720]   so much of a better experience at home.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.440]   I might experience at home is way better than I can get almost except for a
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.040]   Adobe cinema.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.200]   I can't get the same experience anywhere else.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.720]   Well, that's why the dome, they should save the dome because there's certain
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.680]   places, there's events, but you know, most of America doesn't live within
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.600]   driving jobs theater in his garage.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.520]   I mean, we have, we have in Marin.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.160]   You love theater.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.360]   What he does live nearby is the Marin theater, the widescreen theater that
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.520]   they, that George Lucas created THX for and really is a nice single screen.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:42.840]   It is.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.160]   It's, it's a little aged.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.200]   You know, it's a day.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.920]   Again, the I go down, I will only sit in four seats inside of a doll.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.640]   We sent them out to for, if I'm going to go out to a theater, there's literally
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.840]   one, you know, I go to San Francisco with my, with my son usually in and we'll go
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.400]   down and there's, it's like 10 E through age or something like that.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.360]   Those are the only only seats.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.960]   If I'll just schedule my time around when those seats are available, because
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.160]   they're right in the middle of the theater with no seats in front of you.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.680]   And so when Gemini man came out, remember that movie?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.400]   Terrible movie.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.680]   Remember what, but what came out was 120 Hertz.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.040]   There were 14 theaters in America that could play it at 120 Hertz.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.440]   It is.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.320]   It is not at least at this point, it is not
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.920]   easy for people to go see it.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.800]   And most of the way.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.280]   It's much easier.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:28.760]   Cities.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   Again, it's much easier to roll this out over Apple TV than it is over theaters.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.920]   It's just it's a, because Apple TV is a $300 item, where, or $200 item or whatever
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.480]   they charge it.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.080]   If we're a theater, it's going to be a $100,000 projector.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.240]   You know, I think it'll be very interesting.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.320]   I'm not sure I'm ready for this, but at the same time, it's, you know, it's the future.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.960]   You don't, you know, there's things, if you're watching Casablanca, you don't want
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:57.440]   Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman through your window, you know, looking at them in
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:57.960]   real life.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.560]   You want to see that dreamy kind of feeling.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:06.440]   But again, like Andy's watching, you know, big nights reveal it may be something
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.880]   that's just our generation will be the last.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.240]   Back at old movies though.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.760]   They're not as pretty moves in the lockoffs and everything else.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.720]   You're kind of like, I keep that's pretty slow.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.360]   I have the crack.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.520]   I get the criteria in general.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.120]   That's wrong.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.080]   No, it isn't wrong.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.200]   I get the criteria.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   I know it's sacrilege, but it's true.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.000]   I get the criterion channel, which is great for old movies.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.120]   Saw criterians old movies.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.960]   And I, at least weekly try to get Lisa to sit down and watch one with me.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.840]   And I said, God, this was a great movie.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.880]   And I watch it and I'm going.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.400]   And you could tell she's losing interest because it's just.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:45.440]   I think there's an nostalgia, Andy, but filmmaking is advanced so far.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.280]   Well, it's never it's never about the technology used to create the movie.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.160]   It's always about the eye from exactly.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.080]   And look at Meg, which is a brand new movie shot as if it were citizen Kane
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.360]   and a great movie, right?
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:29:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.880]   Thanks.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:07.760]   But yeah, it's it's I this is one of those times where frequent times
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.320]   are really which that Roger Rebert were still around because he would have
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.280]   so much insight about this.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.400]   I do remember that off the top of head that he did write about some of the
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.840]   psych some of the psychology or physiology of how the eye response to the
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.920]   moving image that is.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.760]   Well, yeah, he actually was writing about high high frame rate with for
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.280]   anybody else because he was he was a big, big proponent of this thing called
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.400]   the assistant called show scan, which was essentially it was mostly used for
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.080]   right technology, but it was very, very high rate, high rate filmmaking.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.440]   And he would say, I every time I see a demo of this is like the greatest,
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.160]   the real of the next thing at the same time.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.480]   And this is why he was so great.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   He could say that, well, there's the it's not just 24 frames per second.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.320]   Isn't just being aware that it's a movie versus it's a higher frame rate.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.120]   So I feel as though it's real life, it has a it has an actual effect on the
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.600]   brain.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.320]   It's a brain hack that's that basically puts the brain into a state that
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.200]   makes it more receptive to, okay, I'm going to accept that this reality
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.520]   being presented to me is is I'm not going to I'm not going to worry that these
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.760]   spaceships should not be making noise in a vacuum.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.440]   It should not be doing banking turns.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.760]   I'm simply going to enjoy this thing, this story and treat these people that
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.600]   I'm seeing as actual real people.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.280]   So there's there's a lot of stuff going on there.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:30.680]   As the technology has changed since the since 1900, it's the basics of storytelling,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.800]   the basics of value of cinema have never changed.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.920]   It's always about characters.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.640]   And that doesn't require 24.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.800]   Doesn't does work out 24 doesn't require 120.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.240]   So it'll all work out.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.120]   It all comes to writing acting.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.800]   I agree.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.200]   I mean, directing the I agree.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.680]   The other thing that I think that Apple did recently and I can't
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.760]   remember what what piece it was.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.960]   Maybe Renee or Andy, I remember, but the the Apple put out a podcast that's
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   related to one of their products.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.920]   So they have a podcast that's added content.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.400]   Wow.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:05.760]   That, you know, for against one of the Apple TV products, that is
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.600]   revolutionary.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.880]   I mean, you know, like if if content creators start, sorry, the walk with me.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.400]   Thing that lets you if you're Apple watch, it tells you stories as you're walking.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.800]   No, I think that there was no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.880]   I know what your talk has.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.440]   Yeah, I saw it go by it.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.080]   But it's not the first time.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.560]   Remember, you know, the walking dead had that's what made me think of walk with me.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.200]   And if anything of it had talking, walking dead or whatever, talking dead.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.240]   So it's it's this actually started, I think this started when HBO started realizing
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.640]   that these episodic shows had a huge opportunity for marketing and social media.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.080]   You get people talking about Easter eggs and stuff.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.640]   And so this is Apple's not new to this, but I would expect Apple to become a very
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.120]   adept at the kind of side.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.400]   Well, they have a lot more of the universe.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.480]   Yeah, they own that part.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.720]   So it could be interesting.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.840]   I, you know, it's it's going to be just very interesting to see.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.120]   I think part of this Andy is you and I are old timers and love old movies and we're
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.840]   used to that dreamy look.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.080]   Remember, we were talking a few weeks ago, somebody, and I still can't remember
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.400]   who it was, said that we Holly was doing virtual reality practically since the beginning
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.360]   since that film with a train coming out, you got everybody to run out of the theater.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:26.000]   That's what a bit between the music, the pictures, the sound, the big screen.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.480]   It did engulf you.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.640]   You became a part of it.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.520]   It was virtual reality without putting any headsets on.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.760]   I'm going old school Hollywood.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.840]   Oh, I like it.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.400]   Very nice.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.960]   Look at that.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.680]   Show show Alex.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.320]   Can you switch or where you lost the switcher?
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.840]   There you go.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.520]   So I'm doing where those.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.760]   Exactly.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.560]   Is it red, blue or red, green?
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.160]   Is it red, blue?
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:46.880]   It's red, blue.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.840]   Yeah, it's red, blue.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.040]   I actually, he's got clip-ons, folks, for you listening that give you the old 3D
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.440]   movie red, red, blue thing.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.760]   I started building three.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.880]   I have a couple extra iPhone 12s.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.400]   And so I built a 3D.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.840]   Red, green 3D.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.400]   Yeah, with Apple.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.440]   With Apple, with iPhones.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.640]   Why?
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.520]   I printed a rig.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.280]   It's fun.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.640]   As we said, it is.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.160]   Like, where did you get those clip-ons?
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:13.680]   Did you make them?
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.040]   I went on Amazon.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.360]   No, I didn't.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.000]   They see Amazon's got, you can get them in a day.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.360]   What is it?
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.000]   Antigraphic?
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Is that what you could say it was, John?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.680]   Anaclyph.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.800]   Anaclyph, that's right.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.080]   It looks amazing.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.000]   Like when it works, you're just like, oh, this is.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.480]   This is great.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.320]   I built a, yeah, I printed a rig for it.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.840]   Yeah, they sell them on Amazon.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.800]   That's hysterical.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.320]   Oh, yeah, it works.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.880]   It works great.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.760]   That one right at the top.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.040]   That's the one I mostly do when I have contacts on.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.080]   That's the best one.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:39.520]   That's the best one.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.080]   I will.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   $10.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.640]   I mean, I ordered all of them that they had in there.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.440]   And that's the best one.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.120]   It's.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.880]   And then if you really want to go old school, you can get a
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.320]   dozen of the cardboard ones for $7.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.960]   I'm amazed somebody makes those.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.560]   You know, it's still so the 3D is so much is still so much fun.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:00.880]   Might.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.480]   On Sundays, we go out to the beach and I just have to.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.920]   I don't do very well.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.720]   Just laying around the beach.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.960]   So I do 3D and photogrammetry and things like that.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   It's like what I do.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.360]   I don't I don't really fish.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.480]   It's too cold, but that's hysterical.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.840]   I love it.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.120]   Let's take a little break.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.040]   Cause I'm sure there's other things we could talk about
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   besides the Apple event.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.720]   We're going to have a lot of fun on the next Tuesday.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.640]   What is that April 21st?
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.360]   20th April 20th April 20th 10 am Pacific.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.760]   That's one.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.120]   The music.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.440]   The music.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.480]   Say again.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.240]   There are memes because Apple announced WWDC precisely 69 days
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.400]   early and then they announced an event for 4/20.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   So the entire the entire internet is left right now.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   Lord, you stoners.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.080]   You just got to give up on the fellow kids fellow kids at
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.680]   Apple Marketing.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.400]   Let me see.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.840]   4/20 Apple memes.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.440]   If I search for them, are they on they're on the Twitter, aren't they?
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.200]   Probably and probably the Reddit.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   I can't find them.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.880]   I could find funny Apple bong weed memes, but I don't really want to show those.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.680]   Well, because Craig Craig Federico joked about OS 10 weed a while.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.360]   That's right.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.160]   It's going to haunt them forever.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.480]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.320]   What's highly inappropriate?
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.280]   All right.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.200]   Again, I'm very early days.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.960]   I'm old fashioned.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.240]   I'm old fashioned guy.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.560]   Mike Andy, who's feeling his way into a new.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.000]   Look at that.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   That's how Indiana look.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   High contrast.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.440]   There you go.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.360]   I'm doing I'm doing I'm doing the rest of the show in two strip technical.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.560]   Nothing but blue and green.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.640]   You slow down the frame rate, though, because you're a little too realistic.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.200]   Coming at you live from across the sea.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.680]   How about we shot at 48 frames and we thought that was too realistic.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.920]   Imagine 120.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.040]   Oh, Alex is going black and white.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.280]   Oh, now you really do look like you should be in citizen.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.240]   OK, see, this is what I like about black and white.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.800]   There's just something crispy about it that gives it a very.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.680]   We should do the whole thing in black and white.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   You look grungy.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.600]   You look like this now it's street photography, Alex, instead of what we got a
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.640]   game before, which is beauty shot, Alex.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.920]   That Navy seal podcast that the every episode is in black and white.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.640]   I forget what it is.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.240]   What it's called.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:09.760]   It should be.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.360]   It should be black and white.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.040]   There's something about it.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:17.960]   NASA is using red and blue 3D glasses to safely drive.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.560]   And I can't read the rest of the headline.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.320]   I'm going to have to go look at it.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:30.880]   Oh, it's in the it's in Gizmodo to safely drive the Mars Rover while working from home.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.600]   Now, see, this is too.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.360]   This is this is like silver tone.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.320]   If you're if you're listening, just imagine.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.720]   Now I look grungy.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.240]   Now I look like a like street Leo.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.240]   The only person is in color still is Renee.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.400]   Oh, I went back.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.120]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.840]   Yeah, I'm not giving it up.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.440]   Leo, it's like an episode of WandaVision.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.560]   You go from black and white to color.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.160]   You don't go back.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:04.840]   Oh, suddenly the 420 kicked in our show today brought to you by Express V.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.480]   P.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.440]   And have you ever browsed it in cognito mode?
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.640]   I loved it.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.320]   What was it?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.400]   It was a judge in in.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   It was a lawsuit against it was a lawyer loss.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.560]   No, I think it was the judge who said it.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.000]   A lawsuit against Google.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.600]   And the lawyer said, wait a minute, you're telling me that when I'm in
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.120]   in cognito mode, Google can still.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.760]   And she by the way, approved the class action lawsuit.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.960]   Google can still see everything I'm doing.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.640]   Yeah, the only thing in cognito mode or what is it?
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.960]   Private browsing and so far.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:46.240]   The only thing those modes do is hide what you're doing from your spouse or
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   your roommates.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:53.400]   It doesn't hide anything from the internet service provider from Google.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.240]   If you're doing a Google search, Google's made a fortune.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.840]   They're one of the most valuable companies in the world.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.720]   And how do they do it?
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.480]   Tracking you.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.160]   There's this lawsuit, this class action lawsuit is now for $5 billion.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.920]   And it comes down to the fact that in cognito mode ain't so incognito.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.160]   Google says, well, incognito doesn't mean invisible.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.240]   How do you make yourself invisible online?
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.480]   Express VPN.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.200]   See, the beauty of Express VPN is as soon as you fire it up.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.120]   And by the way, it runs on every device you've got, even your smart TV.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.840]   Even you can get it on a router.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.680]   Many of your routers can be adapted to work with Express VPN, which means your
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.880]   whole house could be private because you're going through past the internet service
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.200]   provider. They can't see what you're doing out to the Express VPN server, then
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.280]   emerging into the world with a randomized IP address that Google has no idea who you
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:46.640]   are.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.680]   They don't know.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.720]   Every time you turn on an Express VPN, you get a different IP address.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.800]   Other Express VPN customers share it.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.960]   Third parties have to use some other trick to identify you and harvest your data.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.160]   Not that they're not trying, but why make it easy?
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.240]   Best part is Express VPN is easy for you.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.560]   No matter what device you're on, all you have to do is press the big button and you're
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.080]   protected.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.800]   I think Express VPN is a no brainer.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.200]   And one of the things I like about Express VPN compared to other services is they
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.520]   invest in infrastructure.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.480]   So their speed is right up there, which means you can watch HD video without
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.000]   buffering.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.800]   You can, you're going to be able to do all the things.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   In fact, if you put it on your router, you won't even know and no one in your house
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.200]   will know that you're using it, except that nobody out in the outside world will
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.040]   know what you're doing.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.960]   If you really want to go in cognito and protect your privacy, secure yourself with

[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.680]   Anything else to say about April about four 20.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.920]   I wonder.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.320]   I was wondering if there.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.440]   I was just wondering if Tim is going to take this opportunity to talk some more
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.600]   about privacy and talk some more about talk some more basically start with a
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.240]   battlefront update because they're fighting Facebook very publicly.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.880]   They're fighting Epic very publicly.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.440]   And this might be an opportunity to continue to fire some shots across the
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.600]   bow of those two entities.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.640]   I can guarantee you he will because obviously 14.5 is going to roll out on
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.760]   Tuesday and that's the big change right 14.5 now forces everybody to to ask your
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.560]   permission to turn on the IDFA.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.960]   They have the private everybody.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.640]   I'll have to have a privacy label now.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:02.920]   Right.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.440]   This is the this is the cliff that Facebook was worried about.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.280]   This is this is this is the death knelt of small business everywhere.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   Yeah, that's what they say.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:18.920]   I'm buying like 18 pizzas from the pizza place next door because Apple is going to
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.600]   be putting them on a business according to Facebook.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.400]   I'll put it in the freezer.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.960]   The it'll be interesting to see if Apple does anything.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.760]   If there's any demos with the new iPad that are related to AR and whether
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.040]   they use unity or not, as opposed to unreal, you know, in the past, the unreal
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:39.560]   was part of those, they're unreal executions were part of the keynotes.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.760]   Obviously that's not going to happen.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.120]   So it'll be interesting to see if unity suddenly shows up and if they do,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.000]   it's just really going to be a bummer for Epic because, you know, it's an
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.320]   unforced error, you know, like it's it's unity was just about, I mean, most of us
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.680]   had kind of forgotten about them.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.840]   And now we're all the headline attention.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.640]   The app store or pub G now for what?
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.880]   They're for pub G now.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.000]   All the features on the app store are for Fortnite competitor.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.320]   Well, the one that Fortnite copied to Apple has been constrained by the judge
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   from blocking unreal engine apps.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.920]   Right.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.440]   They wanted to.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.640]   So you but so you think Apple is going to say, oh, see, you say it's an
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.640]   unforced error on Epic.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.880]   And I guess it is Epic's fault.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.920]   They've been planning this for years.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.320]   But isn't it?
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.200]   Doesn't it hurt Apple more than it hurts.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.240]   No, it doesn't really have any real.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.040]   I mean, again, I think that the I don't think it hurts Apple.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.600]   I mean, there's wouldn't developers want to use unreal over uni.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.480]   They still can't.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   Well, the hard part is is that it was they still can so they can use unreal.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.440]   All they want.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.360]   So that's not going to.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.760]   But if Apple starts showing unreal, like most people don't, I'm sorry, unity.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.280]   Most people don't know the difference still today.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.800]   So is that is unity is good?
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   Is it five?
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.320]   Can unity?
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:57.720]   It's different.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.560]   Come on is in unity.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.280]   Yeah, Pokemon's in unity.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:00.640]   It's different.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.720]   It's not exactly.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.880]   It's realistic game.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.440]   My favorite.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.120]   It's different.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.560]   All they want is to be compiled.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.920]   Yeah, that's for cross compilation.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.640]   But but you're saying unity to replace the unreal engine for 3D graphics.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.360]   It does a lot of great 3D.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:14.680]   It does.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   It has a couple of things that unreal unreal has spent a lot more money on the.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.200]   The ecosystem.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:26.120]   So their ecosystem related to assets that you can get, things that you can build.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.280]   They have a meta human project that's amazing.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.360]   They've really invested more in their community, I believe, than then unity.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.920]   And they were kind of bolstered by Fortnite.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.880]   So so there's a lot of things that have kind of moved down the path.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.760]   So I think Epic has a lot more of the mind share right now.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.280]   If Apple brings unity into it and starts, you know, just and they don't have to do
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.240]   anything else to endorse them.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.040]   And they say, here's an AR solution done in unity.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.640]   Like that's all that's all they have to do.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.800]   And there's going to be a lot of people that suddenly go, Oh, what is unity?
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.520]   And whoa, maybe I'll use that.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:03.160]   And and so it is it just evens the playing field out, you know, a little bit more
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.080]   than than it has been in the last couple of years.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.200]   Because we started in unity.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.160]   I mean, that most of our early tests were in unity.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.440]   And so it's it's it's a great platform.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.640]   It doesn't have some things we need for broadcast.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.120]   So it doesn't have great tracing.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.520]   It doesn't have the triple stuff that games want.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.360]   Right. In fact, on the unity demo page, the very top game is a 2019 release
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.320]   called the heretic.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.200]   So but but maybe that doesn't matter on mobile or not.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.320]   Well, or I pad.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.760]   But AR is like is entirely different world.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.400]   Like it what's needed and what's not needed in is unity sufficient for AR.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.320]   Okay.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.760]   You could arguably be as good or better than unreal for AR.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.160]   Somebody in the chat room evil evil John, who was actually a great resource in the
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.920]   chat room, says that it's actually harder to use on real on on mobile.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   And it's a C plus plus platformers.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.600]   Unity is C sharp, which he says easy to learn.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:08.200]   But remember the the big kerfuffle was that Apple initially pulled the entire
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.280]   developer license for us.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:09.840]   No, I remember.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.240]   And they were ordered by the court.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.120]   Exactly.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:17.280]   So it was never I don't think it was ever a risk of apps that use this engine being
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.400]   pulled from the app store in case anybody knows.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.560]   Well, I were if I were a developer, I'd still wonder what's going to be the upshot
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.320]   of the court action.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.520]   The court you could all the court did was deny was it was was except a
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:36.600]   injective relief from Epic and deny Apple the right to cancel any any real stuff.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.960]   So you could also worry that Epic is not the best steward for unreal because they
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.880]   have a conflict of interest.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.480]   Oh, I agree.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.840]   And managing their games and how they're managing the platform.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.200]   And they arguably like the like again, the judge and Apple both said, we'll put
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.040]   everything in escrow.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.320]   We'll figure this out and then you know, people can keep playing.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   They can keep doing everything.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.040]   And Epic was the only one who said, no, Apple said yes to that.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.160]   And so you can start to wonder founders are different than CEO.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.160]   Sometimes CEOs are like grownups and founders are like little kids still.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.080]   So it's I think it's fair for people who develop on the unreal platform to wonder
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.320]   if Tim Epic has their best interests in mind or doesn't.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   Clearly.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.360]   Because he's he risked it all for them.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.760]   And Apple and Apple pulled wanted to pull the developer license.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.760]   And so, you know, unity suddenly showing up on every Apple event would would be
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.920]   some clear signaling to developers where Apple is interested in.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.720]   It's kind of like final effect thing showing up at every Apple event and Adobe
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.280]   premiere disappearing or well, you know, and on and on and on our aperture versus
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.240]   Lightroom.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.040]   And I still think that, you know, AR is going to be a bigger game than games or
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.000]   it's a bigger, a bigger field than games and a lot of other things.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.920]   It's going to be something that you use everywhere.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.560]   Education.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.240]   But it's clear.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.120]   Apple understands how important gaming is.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.760]   They just expanded Apple Arcade to 180 titles.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.840]   I think they want to be the mobile gaming default mobile game platform.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.000]   They look at what the title makes on a switch and they go.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.960]   That would be nice.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.240]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   I think but I think that
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.160]   AR is going to be a big deal.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   Yeah, I know you do.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.440]   I know you do.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.880]   And I that's the that's the kind of pause that I my trained eyes.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.280]   Says that he knows something.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.360]   He was about to say something, but he comes up.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.960]   OK, OK, interesting.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.560]   OK.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.000]   It is going to be a big deal.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.920]   Maybe Apple and that's you think Apple and that's something on Tuesday or you
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.480]   or do you want to recuse yourself?
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.000]   You got it.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.600]   It's too early.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.160]   No, no, I doubt I doubt that that would happen.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.720]   I mean, I think that the earliest you'd see it as June and probably next June.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.560]   I wouldn't but but it could be.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.520]   They will talk about it at WWDC.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.640]   They'll need to.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.200]   Right.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.400]   I mean, they're talking about it all the time.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.880]   So they're talking about AR all the time.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.360]   Apple's talking about AR all the time.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.920]   But not concrete terms.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.560]   They're talking about how much they like it, right?
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.040]   I mean, we need it.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:42.560]   We need it.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.520]   It's with DK and we.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.360]   But the chances is that they're talking about how much they like it and they also
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.480]   incorporated a 3D engine into Final Cut and motion.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:51.840]   Right.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:57.600]   You know, like that that's just that is no small feat to put a high
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.200]   performance 3D engine into an editing package.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.040]   So so there's and they put light on the high end iPads and they put lighter on the
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.440]   phone.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.880]   So clearly that's all that's important.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:12.440]   For them, it's an incredible amount of investment to go down a path that they don't
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.160]   think is a big deal.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.960]   But it's not unheard of for a company to go down a path that they think is going to be
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.000]   a big deal and the market not following.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.320]   Yep.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.960]   3D video, for instance.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:32.240]   So Apple, I agree with you as clear Apple's hardcore on this, but it's yet to be
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.520]   demonstrated that that's a market.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.480]   Meanwhile, AAA gaming is a market.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.080]   It's a chart, Stolio charts charts.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.880]   What did Tim Cook tell the Cara Switcher about AR that if they if they had AR right
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.000]   now, they could be looking at charts together and people who are looking to the podcast could be looking at charts.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.760]   I thought sold not sold.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.400]   No, but the Tim Cook, everything is a is a pivot table.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.960]   Pivot tables in 3D might be kind of cool.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.440]   You could watch them.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:49:59.840]   Pivot.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:19.880]   I mean, I think that some of the things that we look at is the ability to imagine a classroom, let's say talking about how motors work and all the kids can sit there and just pull them apart on their own, not a shared experience, but pull them apart in front of them and be able to move things around and pull and be talking interactively about it.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:25.120]   And everyone's able to play with it and ask questions and pull it in and have things pop up in front of them and everything else.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   And that's just education.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.960]   That's not like how to build the chair that you just bought or does the couch look good in your and the.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.240]   I was going to revolutionize education.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.040]   And so was I books and on and on and on.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.480]   I don't.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:42.520]   I think Apple's interest in this does not does not determine whether it's going to happen.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.440]   But I would it's not on a matter.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   I would argue that I would argue that the investment put into I books or the iPad is a fraction of what we're seeing with AR.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.000]   Like if it's not saying you're wrong, I want to say clearly, I'm not saying you're wrong.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.960]   I'm just saying it's unknown.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:03.960]   And I guess I guess from Apple's point of view, getting everybody to use unity would further what they think is going to be the next big thing.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   But if I'm a developer and I'm using Unreal Engine, I'm having to think long and hard now.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.840]   But what do I do?
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.480]   Are there a lot of it?
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:11.960]   It's not so much.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.120]   It's not so much art.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.200]   The thing is, is that we're still in the very early days of it where there's just not that many developers.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:17.560]   Right.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.640]   So it's not a matter of if you're using Unreal, should you move to Unity?
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.120]   It's if you're using nothing, which one should you pick?
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.520]   And so that's the because that's 99% of the market right now.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.160]   There is.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.320]   I'm talking about nobody.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.760]   Not not AR at this point, but 2D games.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.040]   And there are a lot of AR.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.480]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.560]   To be here.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.880]   To be in there are a lot of games using Unreal Engine right now that are wondering what do we do?
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.440]   And are they going to put over to unity?
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.280]   I don't think so.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:45.800]   That's I don't know.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.120]   I don't.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:51.240]   But again, I still think that that the market is could will grow to be a lot bigger.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:51.440]   Right.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.600]   So I think that that's the issue.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:55.760]   When?
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.880]   The next couple of years, I miss my imagine is what I imagine.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:07.600]   And I guess if you're big studio, you're thinking about what's going to happen in 2023 and 2024, not what's happening in 2021.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.080]   It takes a couple of years to build a game.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.240]   Think about where it's going to be then.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.800]   So would you say, so if you're developing a game at this point, you're not going to use Unreal.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.080]   You're going to use Unity.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   Well, I'm doing we're doing training in office hours with Unreal right now.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.600]   So I'm so I know.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.120]   I know.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.840]   You know, so but right now, we're worried about concepts of just how to do real time 3D.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.120]   So and we have experts in Unreal available to us.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.440]   And so that makes sense.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.560]   I will say that I am bluntly looking at.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.360]   Languageing from Apple to decide what we're going to do.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.960]   Like as far as what I'm going to do as far as developing content.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:47.880]   That I'm looking at as a person who's potentially moving into this market to do more content development.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.600]   I am absolutely looking at the next three events from Apple.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.040]   Yes.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.360]   As if I see a whole lot of unity, I'm going unity.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.240]   Like it's like, you know, like I'm not going to.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:55.680]   That's exactly.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.320]   I'm not going to my market is the iPhone.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.200]   If I see Apple spending a lot of time and money, if I don't, then I'll stick with what I have.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:02.520]   Right.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:08.480]   But it's but but I have to, you know, from a cold hard, you know, from a cold hard business decision,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.960]   if if Apple's signaling that they're going to go heavy into unity, then then you're better off.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:18.240]   Not taking any chances because right now we don't know how long that court case will go.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.160]   Maybe Apple wins and then they just cut everybody off.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:28.320]   When did when did Tim Cook say Epic wants to turn the app store into a flea market was?
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.720]   He gave a couple of clues to Toronto star.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.360]   So so Renee, that's that's that's that's that's your territory.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.520]   I think it's a Canadian paper, I believe.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.480]   Yes.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.760]   I don't subscribe.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.160]   So I can't read the article.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.040]   You get it on Apple news.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.360]   Leo, if you're in Canada, at least I think maybe in the US too.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:46.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.280]   One of the perks in the US.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.240]   I've I've read it in the US last night or the day before I'm on it right now.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.960]   And it says this article is exclusive to subscribers.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.000]   Yeah, it's in Apple and use plus.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.440]   So if you have Apple news, I'm known here as Apple news plus, but me, I should just stop saying.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.400]   I have it.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.040]   I have it.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.960]   Don't use cheap cheap, cheap, cheap skate for the world's free journal.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.520]   I have it.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.280]   Yes.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.040]   That's a good way.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.080]   I'm surprised that Wall Street Journal so on for that very reason.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:11.840]   All right.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.520]   So let me see.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.080]   I have to look at it on my iPhone now.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:14.560]   Is that it?
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.560]   So what did he say?
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.760]   You're you're looking at it, Renee.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.440]   What did he say?
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.120]   No, I mean, it's the same.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.280]   It's it's it's somewhat what he said with the cariswitcher thing where Apple's actually,
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.400]   I guess, cariswoon was a little bit different, but he's basically making his case that on one hand,
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:32.200]   sideloading is evil and will allow malware and all sorts of undesirable things break the security
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.400]   and privacy of the iPhone.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:37.280]   And on the other hand, that the Apple App Store is curated and provides a premium experience.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:43.080]   And it's not just like a bizarre or a flea market where you can have any manner of potentially
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.680]   dangerous or or spyware strewn apps available to you.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.480]   Alex, you you you feel very strongly.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.080]   I think that Apple's App Store.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:58.680]   A vague is fair and people should just put up with it and pay the 30% of it.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.280]   I think it's fair.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.880]   I think it's I think I don't.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.960]   I think it's just a dangerous path to start telling people what they can mean.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.920]   We we're paying high margins all the time as consumers.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.560]   I mean, when you buy a gap, you know, sure.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.240]   It's 100% markup when it's when it's 50% off, it's still it's still a
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.440]   profit market market, you know, it's a huge profit.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.360]   Like they're buying those they're building those shirts for like $3 each.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.920]   And so the idea that we get into like there is nowhere to unpeel this.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.640]   Like you can talk about 30% or whatever, but 30% is a typical markup.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.840]   I mean, most equipment that I buy is running at 40, 50%.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.120]   Now Walmart has been able to beat everybody into the ground, but but, you know, I've talked
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.120]   to people who, for instance, started selling, you know, food at Costco.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:46.520]   And what it did to string out all the margin, you know, had them just not sell it there anymore,
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.440]   because they were like, we can't maintain quality.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.880]   We can't do anything at low margins.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.120]   And so when you start, the thing is, is that, you know, we have to decide on value.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.000]   Is it is that app worth it to us to do?
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.280]   And the developer has to decide, is it is that market worth it for me?
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:05.120]   But starting to tell companies what you micro managing their percentages by the government
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.840]   or the judges seems really.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.760]   It's hard to swallow as something that it's okay.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.880]   And especially, I was just saying, especially when you don't have 90% of the market, like
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.200]   anybody who talks about Google or Microsoft as parallels is just wrong.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.440]   They're wrong because because that was 90% of the market, 90% of the market and 40% of
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.600]   the market or 45% of the market are two entirely different worlds, you know.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:35.240]   And so you have to take all of the ones that are the older ones and just throw them away
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.840]   if they're over 85% of the market, because it's an entirely different conversation.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.440]   You absolutely don't have a choice.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.960]   But right now, you do.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.960]   You can go to Android and use that.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.320]   And there's a whole crazy market there that's available to you.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.280]   Ben Thompson had a really interesting thing that I had not considered previously.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.480]   And he was saying that one of the biggest things that people face is churn.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:56.760]   And some of the churn comes from people whose credit cards just expire.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:01.640]   And there is a huge upside to having a credit card that's attached to the App Store powering
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.320]   your app because people do not let their App Store credit cards expire.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:10.040]   And that changed his opinion on the value equation of Apple, charging more than just
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.960]   what stripe would charge for a transaction fee.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:20.200]   Apple has declined to attend a hearing from the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.960]   I think they said they're going to send somebody now, right?
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.520]   So Tim wasn't available because there's an event.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.320]   Turns out there's a Tuesday they're going to do it?
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.280]   No one or they're not going.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.160]   It's Wednesday, but it's Wednesday, but he's got a bunch of stuff to do around the event.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.360]   He's got a flying officer.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.000]   He's got a flying officer.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.360]   Doesn't have an airplane to hand.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.960]   Actually, it wouldn't be flying anyway.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.280]   They would just do it by a stills.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.840]   He's got all these post events.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.880]   This is Webex.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.600]   Process it.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.320]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.200]   It's also inconvenient.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.720]   They could send a representative, but.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.840]   They are.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.360]   They're sending their chief compliance officer.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:52.600]   Okay.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.320]   That's yeah.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.640]   All right.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.240]   That's kind of what they've done in the past.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.760]   It's you don't always want to send the CEO.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.280]   They've got other things to do.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.640]   Well, especially in the middle of the court case, you don't want to be
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.320]   speaking under oath.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.720]   That's just a fishing trip.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.360]   That's right.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.640]   You know, that's an expedition.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:12.680]   And so it's a horrible idea to send anybody that could possibly
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:17.640]   connect it to a place where they're under oath and being, that's nuts.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:26.840]   Apple, not that this was a surprise, but in the epic discovery, they found some emails.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.080]   And during a deposition, they got some quotes.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.920]   I think the most telling one is from an email from Phil Schiller,
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:44.520]   who was responding to a former Apple employee who suggested the number one most difficult reason
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:49.640]   to leave the Apple universe is I message, I message amounts to serious lock in to which
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:54.360]   Schiller responded, moving I message to Android would hurt us more than help us.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.440]   This email illustrates why pretty clear.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.440]   I am so shocked.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:04.040]   We always expect an area on the Xbox.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.720]   They don't put Halo on the PlayStation.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.440]   They don't put the Google camera app on other Android phones.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.280]   I am so shocked that there's business going on in these establishments.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.920]   I was hoping they would do it for the people.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:18.440]   But you know what, Google's inability to create a good Android.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.880]   It would cost them money.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.240]   Well, no, but there's like, there's four things.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.200]   It would cost them a lot of money to do it with almost no upside.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.360]   Apple is historically not good at services or across platform.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.080]   So I don't even want to know what kind of app apparently they,
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.400]   according to the deposition, they had an app.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.120]   They had written one.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.320]   You do, but that's not a quality.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.840]   I mean, they have Apple music on Android.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.760]   It's not like my favorite app.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.440]   And the last thing is that the only reason that I message is in the game,
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.760]   it's not in the game except in North America.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.160]   And that's because it is built into the SMS app.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.680]   It is drop dead easy to do.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.400]   On Android, you'd have to press a button to make a default.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.240]   And people won't even do that.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.520]   So like, it's just, I don't see any upside to them doing it.
[00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:01.000]   They also, the other interesting thing in that deposition related to time message was
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.400]   they were specifically saying that it would basically,
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.640]   and not just to send people to Android, but send like their kids to Android.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.040]   So yeah, the cheap Android phones, the parents would buy cheap Android phones
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.760]   because you don't want to spend $500 on the phone for your kid.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.360]   So and that's, you know, but that's, you know, I, it's fine.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:29.560]   Yeah, it's, it's like the only, it does, as usual, make me think about the next time that
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.400]   whenever they're talking about the, oh, well, gosh, on the Android platform,
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.360]   they don't have this on the Android platform, you miss the, of that.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.200]   It's like, well, you have a wonderful platform.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.080]   You could extend it.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.120]   And if you, if you really, if, if all these things that you keep
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.000]   couching in terms of, but we have a mission for humanity,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.840]   we're trying to make the planet a better place.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.080]   We believe that certain things are basic human, right?
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.560]   Like it's okay for you to say that this is what we want.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.400]   This is a good business decision for us.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.480]   As Renee said, there's a very, very rational argument.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.440]   It's a clear thing.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.520]   This is why I don't, I don't just trust them.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.040]   I don't roll my eyes at them, but every time they talk about saving the world,
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.640]   I say there's always a business.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.840]   I'll give you another example.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.680]   And I'm a apologize because it's a little convoluted.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.240]   Google killed Hangouts last week for Google Fi users,
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.000]   which is the last bastion of cross platform messaging I used to use
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.680]   because I have a, you know, I have a Google phone.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.640]   So I used to use Hangouts on my Google Fi number,
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.120]   and then I had it running on my iPhone so that I could get messages when I didn't
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.400]   have my Android phone with me.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.440]   And that was very convenient.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.600]   That's the number I give out is that Google Fi number.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.640]   So I was looking for a replacement and there is a replacement that's everywhere.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.440]   It's on the Mac.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.320]   It's on PCs.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.360]   It's on Linux.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.800]   It runs on the Android phone.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.640]   The only place that's not is iOS.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.880]   It's called Pulse from a guy named Luke Klinker.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   And Luke says, I wrote an iOS app, but Apple will not let it in the store because
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.880]   it requires an Android phone to use.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.880]   And so they don't want that in their store.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.680]   And that's an example of something that Apple could do at a very,
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.240]   and it's by the way, you pay 12 bucks, they get money for it.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.400]   It requires an Android phone to use it on the, it's an iOS.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:07.880]   Is it, was it a way to get my message working on Android phone?
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.440]   So I think that's another thing you're thinking about beeper.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.160]   Which is another thing.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.600]   But that goes the other direction.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.760]   And by the way, forget beeper.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.680]   There's a thing called AirMessage that works great.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.520]   If you keep a Mac on, you just run AirMessage on it and you can always use your Android phone.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.040]   But so I have it going from iOS to Android.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.000]   That's not the problem.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.480]   What I want is Android to iOS.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.520]   I guess you would have to have an Android phone to use it.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.800]   But how are we distinguishing it from like, what's that?
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.440]   Here's the big difference.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.920]   Well, there's always a difference on iOS because only messages could be
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.120]   your SMS app.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.720]   So that's part of the problem.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.400]   If I could make WhatsApp, yeah, well, if I could make WhatsApp,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.600]   my universal messenger, then I wouldn't have this problem.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.800]   But you can't.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.240]   You can only do it on a contact basis.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.600]   Contact by contact basis.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.560]   You can't.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.800]   So, and I want to be able to receive text messages as well as data messages.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.080]   That's not unreasonable.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.760]   SMS is still widely used.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.360]   Especially for people not in the Apple ecosystem,
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.600]   which I have actually, people I know are not using Android devices.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.480]   I know it's shocking.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.680]   I guess I might be on Android.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   By the way, on Android, you can say, this is my default messaging app,
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.760]   which is what I'm doing with Pulse.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.040]   You can't do it with WhatsApp.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.320]   Half the world does with WeChat.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:33.000]   I mean, I guess for me, it's like, most of my time, if I'm going to text this signal,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.960]   I mean, other than messenger.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.000]   And I can make, so the drawback on signal, I love signal, I would use it.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.400]   And in fact, it can be the default SMS messenger on Android.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.920]   The problem with it, you can only use it on one phone at a time,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.800]   because it's tied to your phone.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.200]   Right.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.520]   So, as soon as you log into your iPhone, it says,
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.360]   "I've deactivated your Android version."
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.560]   Oh, well, that's useless.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.360]   That's part of what killed PBM as well, when they finally ported it.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:57.960]   They may fix that.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.720]   There's rumors they're going to start using it.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.440]   Well, I have to admit, I have an older phone that I use a lot.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.680]   And the main reason I use it is that a whole bunch of people that number
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.800]   that have Android phones.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.040]   Right.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.040]   And that timing to that phone, because I...
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:08.920]   There you go.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.400]   All my other phones get all those other messages.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.520]   And it shows up everywhere.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.760]   In fact, it's a little annoying, because it shows up on a whole bunch of phones,
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.560]   and things going off.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.320]   All Apple would have to do to fix this is make...
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.880]   Allow you to make other messaging apps default.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.000]   Just as they do now with mail and browsers, right?
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.600]   You could change your default browser in your email.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.400]   No, get there.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.200]   Pardon me?
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.880]   I think they'll get there.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.440]   I think they'll do it.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.640]   Yeah, that would solve it.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.320]   Messages might be later, because they might...
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.080]   It might be complicated for them to unravel securely that little bundle
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.960]   that they've put together.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.400]   But I think sooner or later, they'll get there.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.840]   And the other thing we saw is if SMS just died at a horrible death,
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.480]   but that's...
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.480]   In order for that to work, everybody I know would have to use the same messaging app.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.360]   I guess I don't actually understand how messages could be...
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.880]   Could open it up and still be secure, and I'd much rather have security than it open.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.040]   I think that's the...
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.080]   I don't think you could ever...
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.720]   Ever close that...
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.480]   Although it's not that secure.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.560]   I mean, how many times have we seen carefully crafted Apple messages?
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.200]   We have Blastor now, though, Leo.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.600]   What's this? Blastor prevents that now.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.480]   Is that going to fix that?
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.040]   It's a lot easier to keep on working on one that's completely
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.800]   dedicated to that system than it is to start making it available to a bunch of other things.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.680]   I think that's the issue.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:29.160]   And also to be fair, there's no shortage of nice, secure apps for messaging on Android.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:34.200]   So it's not as though Apple's denying something valuable that Android wouldn't have without it.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.680]   I mean, it's a funny me.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.200]   This is a little petty thing.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.640]   But I bring it up as an illustration of the fact that Apple is...
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.800]   It's more than just not making messages for Android.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.280]   It's really...
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.560]   They want that walled garden.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.120]   They really do.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   But it's funny, though, that they make that up like,
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.800]   "Ah, they're holding out messages.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.360]   Messages...
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.920]   Like, if you look at the top-use message apps, it doesn't even show up.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.440]   Like, it's in the other section.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.920]   Right.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.640]   You know, like it's fine.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.360]   Even on iPhone.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.560]   People are using WhatsApp or they're using some telegram or something else.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.360]   I wish we could just...
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.040]   Every manufacturer has exclusive apps.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.000]   Like Google has a bunch of them.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   The Pixel can do things that no other Android phone can do.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.200]   That's why I keep buying the Pixel.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.360]   I'm locked to the Pixel because I want the Google goodness.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.600]   Well, Google has now killed everything for the Pixel,
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.680]   except Android messages that they want you to...
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.640]   And that's the rich text system.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.320]   And they want you to use that.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.360]   I'm going to smuggle a Pixel 5A across the board of America
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.480]   because we're not going to get it anymore.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.160]   I'll be your Pixel Mule.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:33.800]   Well, I'll trade you, I'll trade you pixels for timbits and Nordique's jerseys.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.280]   Okay.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:34.600]   Done.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.720]   [laughter]
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.760]   Ah, let's see.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.240]   Moving right along.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:44.040]   So many controversies.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:44.680]   So a little time.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.520]   Pick one.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.160]   I'll trade.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:47.720]   Pick one.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.640]   Pick one that's outrageous.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.000]   I don't have any outrage anymore.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.200]   Apple's...
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:52.760]   This is good.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.800]   This isn't a response.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   And this may be a little bit of a hint that AirTags is coming out on Tuesday.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.480]   We should do a little betting pool.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.840]   Who would say, "Show a hands."
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.880]   Who would say AirTags will come out on Tuesday?
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.360]   I mean, they have to at some point.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.560]   Or we're going to swap them across.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.760]   Alex says, "I'm going to have learned helplessness."
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.920]   You say they have to at some point.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.960]   That doesn't mean Tuesday.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.040]   Andy and I are going, "Mm."
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.480]   I think betting on it ever appearing on any certain date is a mug's game.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.680]   This is the point I'm going to put on Apple Trek products.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.280]   Yeah, literally.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.720]   But this might be a hint because Apple has decided to open up
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.960]   Find My to third party finding experience.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.160]   The timing seems pretty good.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.920]   So that means...
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.320]   By the way, Tile has not signed up to use this,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.040]   which is...
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.920]   That's the one company that's bitching about Apple not opening it up.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   So, Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof, your VanMoof bicycle.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:57.640]   Your VanMoof bicycle will be on the...
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.920]   I love that idea.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.240]   I wish I had a VanMoof.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.040]   You could go up and find My and see where your bicycle is.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.920]   Someone steals your bike and you like just fall them around.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.040]   Well, don't do that.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.400]   That's one of the risks, of course.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.760]   You know what I go to do?
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.280]   It's the Europeans were very vocal that North America is doing to understand
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.680]   what it's like to have a parking lot with 3,000 bicycles in it.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.720]   Oh, perfect example.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.760]   This is all of them.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.640]   Perfect example.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.600]   I've seen those in Amsterdam.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.760]   You just can't...
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.200]   It's like one of those is mine.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.760]   So, and the Apple press release says beginning next week.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.560]   So, again, I think that's a pretty strong hint.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.520]   It's just weird they put it out before the event.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.280]   Like you'd figure they'd announce air tags at the event
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.280]   and this would be the follow-on press release.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.560]   Also coming out so that Tile can't go to the government and complain about us again
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.680]   is a bunch of other third parties that we're enabling to keep against everybody.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.720]   Tile's a plan is that Apple has a certain advantage
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.560]   because they own the phone, they own the platform and they don't have a cosmo.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.120]   The platform.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.560]   So, Tile has their own advantage.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:04.440]   Can I offer the observation as someone who is not currently under any Apple NDAs?
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.480]   It's possible they need to have an active for the people who already have them
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.240]   or about to soon have them so that they can start playing with them
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.920]   so they can have the different countries there.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:20.280]   Any van Muf S3 or X3 bike purchased from April 7th on will have his little logo
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.400]   underneath the tube.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.760]   Locate with Apple Fyme.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.200]   I think that's really great.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:26.840]   I'd love to see everything.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.400]   Currently, we're going back to Mark Hez's dog video to see if Mac is wearing an air tag on his collar.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.440]   Chipolo makes Bluetooth trackers kind of like the tracker or Tile.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.360]   Here's a picture of keys with a Chipolo tracker on it.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.920]   Will it have parity though with air tags?
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.760]   I mean, will air tags have some advantages that these things won't?
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.840]   The only difference is that the privacy model can vary.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.200]   Apple is going to have an absolute privacy model, but there are others that might let you do more
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.920]   things with your data than the Apple air tags would allow.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.760]   So they get to sort of, you can't mix and match.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.920]   Like you can't say, "I want to let..."
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.960]   Well, the manufacturer can't.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.240]   The manufacturer can't just turn everything on.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.600]   Your air tags will stay private.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.400]   And some of them sort of complained about that, but basically you get to pick
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.280]   whichever company's policy and implementation you prefer.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.760]   Here's the new logo.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.840]   You'll see this on these Belkin earbuds, the Soundform Freedom.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.760]   True wireless earbuds.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   It's like little parentheses surrounding a GPS arrow.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.480]   There's three things that are really clever that they're doing to sort of...
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.040]   So one of the big concerns was that this was just going to be stocker wear.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.760]   That as soon as this came out, people would use it for tracking.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.840]   Nobody cares that Tile has been on the market for years.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.320]   If it's got an Apple logo on it, it is a headline.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:44.040]   So Apple had to sort of balance out the privacy versus the security on this.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.520]   And what they've chosen to do is everything is branded with that logo.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.160]   So if someone tries to give it to you and you don't really know about it,
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.000]   you have a visual cue on it.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.360]   They will also... If the phone that they are set up with leaves of vicinity,
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.960]   it'll pop up on the closest phone and say there's an unknown tracker here.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.400]   So for example, if someone drops it in your bag and then leaves,
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.240]   when you take out your iPhone or iPad, it'll pop up and say there's an unknown tracker
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.240]   proximate to you.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.120]   And then also, if you don't have an iPhone or you're just not looking at it,
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.040]   it will literally chirp at certain intervals so that you will investigate and find these things.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.280]   And some people got upset saying, "Well, if they were stolen,
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.440]   that's going to alert the person that they're trackable."
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.400]   And that's the whole idea.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.240]   They're totally mark robering this.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.320]   This is the glitter bomb fart spray approach where if you hear it chirping,
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.800]   you want to throw it out the window so that you can then go retrieve it.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.600]   You don't want to batman infinite justice on yourself.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.120]   Yeah, you're being tracked.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.720]   I think this, of all the things Apple could announce,
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.360]   this could be the hugest, maybe because I lose things.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.320]   I don't know.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.760]   Put a magic putting it on your drone.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.720]   Do you lose your bike, Leo, in the parking lot in Amsterdam?
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.360]   No.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.920]   But I'm not on my keys.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.200]   I have the tile on my keys and I probably use it once a week.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.120]   Like it's like, "Where do I put those?"
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.320]   I don't look at all.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.920]   I just open up the tile and look.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.800]   Look at this is the find my on an iPhone with little logo with a bike
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.440]   and a logo with headphones and a little logo with your backpack.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.280]   I think that's so cool.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.080]   Apparently, this guy left everything lying around Golden Gate Park.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.640]   He must have gone to the mostly, what is it?
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:23.160]   Outdoors indoor concert that there was some trip festival and left everything behind.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:32.440]   I guess it's time for rumors.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.760]   I hate the rumors, but we got to do the rumors.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.720]   We got to do the rumors.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.800]   Apple's iPhone 13 design renders.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.840]   Who's rendering these and how do they know?
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.240]   Reveals a smaller notch.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.600]   This is from my smart.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:55.080]   Makotakara made the same kind of plastic 3D printed mockups they made last year.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.120]   Based on smaller notch.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.000]   It's a huge thing because all the companies, Apple's going to have their cases ready day one,
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.800]   but nobody else will.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.600]   So there's a huge business in exfiltrating CAD and other design cues from the factories
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:14.520]   and then they fall into the hands of Asian media and they will make mockups and dummy units and
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.320]   3D prints and things so that they can get their cases made in time too.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.640]   Answer me this Renee.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.880]   I didn't know the answer to this.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.040]   We know that the new mini LED displays will start seeing those Tuesday,
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.360]   probably on the iPad Pro.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:32.680]   Apple plans to is buying up panels for laptops.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.840]   Would they go down to the phone?
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.720]   Will they use them on the phone?
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.320]   Will they stick with OLED on the phones?
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.560]   No, my understanding is that what is currently LCD with LED backlight will be transitioned to
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.320]   mini LED because that is just better at that size, medium size,
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.520]   power and things like the Apple Watch and the iPhone that use OLED will transition to micro LED,
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.960]   which is also a self-emitting technology and that goes better with the battery life and
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.640]   other requirements they need.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.960]   That's next year or the year after or the year after.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.440]   Leading edge.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.040]   OLED is pretty good.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.200]   Like OLED on those side screens is really good.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.800]   On the iPhone it's even RGB stripe.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.440]   It's not even Pentile, which is way better.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.120]   The supply chain, according to Digitimes,
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:21.880]   says Apple is going to use low temperature polycrystalline oxide or LTPO-led displays.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.000]   On the iPhone 13 Pro it will have 120 Hertz ProMotion display.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.200]   Is that the first one on the phone?
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.440]   The oxide is the key.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.520]   Yeah, so the oxide is what they added to the iPad to get ProMotion to begin with.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:37.800]   It's what lets them do the adjustable refresh rate and they didn't want to just peg it at 120
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.320]   because that's hugely wasteful.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.760]   Most of the time it's really low.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.720]   So they want that adaptive display rate and you need the oxide in the panel.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:51.080]   Samsung started to do it at note volumes, which is much people forget that Apple sells hundreds
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.960]   of millions of iPhones.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.640]   You need hundreds of millions of panels.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   So Samsung was able to produce those last year for the note, but not for the Galaxy S.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.240]   This year they were able to produce them for the Galaxy S and they're able to finally handle
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.120]   iPhone volumes.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.960]   People, I don't have 120 Hertz phone, but people who have them love them.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.400]   Right?
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.760]   Or maybe they just see this good.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.560]   They go, "It's good."
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:16.120]   They trick into thinking the CPU is like ninja fast when all it's doing is just scrolling and
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.000]   responding faster.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:25.800]   I bought a 120 and iPhone, 120 Hertz computer display to play my game, but unfortunately even with
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.480]   an iN processor and iN graphics card, it can only go about 80 frames.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.200]   So I don't know.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:32.840]   It's 80.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:33.480]   80 is good.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.720]   If you look at 60 on an iPhone compared to 60 on an Android, iOS is already doing a lot.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.000]   It has a much lighter load in terms of the rendering pipeline.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.040]   Android's getting there every year.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.720]   They make that better and faster, but they have, it's like Apple struggles with multitasking.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.400]   Google struggles with rendering pipelines because they both started on the opposite end of the spectrum
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.520]   and they're getting better and better.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.800]   But Apple's is just really good.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.960]   So when you see Apple at 60 Hertz, it's not as bad as some of the 60 Hertz you see on other phones,
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.520]   but 120 Hertz on an iPhone is going to look really, really good.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.520]   And that's something to consider in this new Apple TV.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.280]   That's a, to do 4K at 120 Hertz is a lot of processing.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.640]   Right now, and I don't know if it's the games or the PlayStation 5, but the PlayStation 5 can only do
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.760]   one or the other.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.800]   It can't do both.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.760]   It may just be the game.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.560]   A lot of phones too.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.560]   Like a lot of the earlier Samsung phones, you have to choose.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.720]   You have to go to 1080 if you wanted to have 120 Hertz.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.760]   And now I think you can do it at whatever is keeping.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:21.560]   So what would they put it?
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.160]   This is going to be another showcase for the Apple Silicon, isn't it?
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:33.240]   Like, wow, we can do 4K at 120 Hertz without even getting hot.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.640]   And ramp up and down without, because one of the other big problems is like you could see on some
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.320]   of the earlier phones, when they did try to shift, you could see the whole color management
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.080]   going out of whack as you changed refresh.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.480]   Because I think people forget that some people get like think the resolution is just like cameras.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.920]   It's not the resolution only.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   It's not the refresh rate only.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.680]   It's not the, it's like a variety of things, including color management and the quality of
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.040]   the pixels and the quantity.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.520]   All of that has to work together to make a really good display.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.680]   And if anything is out of whack, you start to see it.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.360]   So if you're changing, if you're watching your phone ramp down and the color point changes,
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.680]   or like on the pixel, the way that they would manage the brightness level would change,
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.840]   just like out of nowhere as it was moving.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.600]   So you got to do a lot right.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.760]   And theoretically, Apple is really good at this stuff.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.320]   But until I see it, I don't going to believe anything.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.240]   Let me take a little break here.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.760]   We will have more.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.080]   There's lots more to talk about with Renee Ritchie,
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:28.200]   youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, with Andy Inako from GBH in Boston.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.440]   And of course, the head of the office hours, Alex Lindsay, which you can sign up for.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.040]   Actually, the best thing, you know, we give out the Bitly link, but really,
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.120]   you would want to go to the YouTube channel and look at it.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.960]   Just go to YouTube and watch it.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.440]   See if you like it.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.560]   I have to say today is this morning's was exceptional.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.920]   So I would highly recommend it.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.280]   Is it on YouTube yet?
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.080]   It's on YouTube.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.360]   It's we had John to tool us from Sound Devices.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.160]   Oh, founder CEO of Sound Devices.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160]   Oh, I'll have to watch that one.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.240]   And it's great when someone who runs the company actually knows the product really well.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:06.840]   I mean, he's literally showing us really complex, you know, stuff with, you know, with it.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.600]   I don't know why it's not up on my.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.360]   Oh, that's 16 hours.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.160]   16 hours?
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.360]   That's 16 hours ago.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.000]   That's the last night.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.200]   Go to home.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.920]   See if it's from last night.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.200]   How many hours a day are you doing?
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.640]   I didn't, you know, four or five hours.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.160]   It's a last night.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:26.760]   But it should be up there.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:32.200]   But you'll see one focus on Sound Devices and I don't know why it's not showing up there automatically.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.560]   But anyway, but anyway, but the whole thing is tightening up.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.360]   So the what we call the producers, they're not the audience anymore because they really
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.560]   are driving the conversation.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.840]   So there are producers.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.080]   And so the producers are asking great questions.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:47.560]   That's nice.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.080]   And voting all those questions up.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.400]   And then the panelists have just gotten really good.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.800]   And so first hour is really amazing.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.760]   And then the second hour was just a very, very great conversation with John about the mixed pre.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.000]   And so how it works and just a lot of Q&A with them.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.760]   And all of this is free and ad free at youtube.com/alexlindz if you want to check it out.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.480]   Our show today brought to you by how many domains do you have, Alex?
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.400]   Have you ever counted the number of domains you have?
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.360]   They're all on hover.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.640]   Yeah, probably 40 or 50.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.080]   Yeah, I got more than that.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.920]   I should log into my hover account.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.000]   I have a lot of domain names.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.440]   I got everything with LaPorte.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.560]   That's the other thing is sometimes if you've got a business, you want to register all of the
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.400]   tummy, all of the tummy, all of the...
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   I got leolaport.blog.me.coffee.tech.social.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.680]   I got them all.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.560]   I got them all.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.280]   And you know what?
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.160]   It's coming along.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.600]   I've used it in various ways.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.240]   When we wanted to set up our Mastodon instance, I had twit.social already.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.120]   That was really nice.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.400]   I could use that right away.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   Twit.community for our forums.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:20:01.480]   Hover is a place that you can as a business establish your brand.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:09.400]   You shouldn't be sending people to, you know, Leo's hot spot at geocities.com.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.040]   It's just not the right thing to do.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.200]   You need to have your business domain.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.000]   Your email should be coming to a custom domain.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.480]   If you're a blogger, you should have a custom domain.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.920]   Mine is leo.fm.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:21.640]   I love that.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.840]   Nice and short.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.360]   Register it at hover.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.520]   If you're creating a portfolio, there's some really great artists domains.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.480]   My photos are at leo.camera, right?
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.480]   If you're building an online store or just you want to make a more memorable
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:41.960]   redirect to your LinkedIn page, you can do it all with hover.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.720]   They've got the best domain names and email addresses waiting for you.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.440]   It couldn't be easier to set up.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:53.400]   If you want to use email, the hover has domain-based emails for all your needs,
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.120]   small or large.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.920]   You add as many mailboxes as to your domain as you need.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.360]   When the domain renews, the mailboxes do too.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.640]   Very fair pricing.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:06.200]   Their most popular mailbox is a no-brainer for business owners.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:11.240]   Plus, because you're using real email, you can use the email app you want to use.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.920]   You can get it from anywhere.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.560]   And Hover also offers web mail, which I think is very nice.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.720]   Hover, it does not upsell you.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.480]   That's the other reason they're fast.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.520]   They're really fast.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.400]   Look at this.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.800]   See.cloud is 75% off.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.520]   Wiki is 83% off.art.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.880]   That's a good one for your portfolio.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.320]   That's 75% off.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.040]   I always check the hover sales every month.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.880]   They have sales on different domain names.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.800]   If you like to manage your own, as I do, they have great domain and email management tools.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.640]   Easy to use, intuitive.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.240]   I'm in there all the time, whether you're a web pro or not.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:50.440]   Although, if you've got a blog or a website and you want to tie your hover domain to it,
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.240]   their hover connect makes it very easy.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.000]   There's lots of services on there.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.160]   And it's just a point and click.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.440]   And they'll do the DNS adjustment automatically.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.920]   Hover is private and secure by default.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.480]   A lot of companies say, "Oh, do you want to spend a little extra on domain privacy with hover?"
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.520]   It's included.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:11.960]   Your private information remains just that.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.480]   Reduce spam and protect yourself from unwanted solicitations.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.480]   Because at Hover, you are a customer.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.080]   You're not a source of data.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.760]   I have to say it's not the same for other domain registrars.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:27.560]   Take back control of your data with a reliable, tracker-free email.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:32.120]   Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers who use hover domains and names
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.960]   and emails to turn their ideas into reality.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.680]   It's all I use for all my domains.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.320]   It took a while.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.080]   I moved them all over bit by bit.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.880]   But now I'm so happy they're all on Hover.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:45.560]   Whether you're a developer, a photographer, a small business hover has something for you to
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.040]   expand your projects and get the visibility you want.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.760]   Just you know what the funnest thing to do in the world is,
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.840]   and you don't even have to have an account to do this,
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:57.080]   is go to Hover and say, just type in a domain name.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.000]   Let me start up at the top here.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.800]   We'll just go to domains and type in something you want.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.920]   Type in-- what should we go?
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.840]   Let's say, what's our new business?
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.720]   Lip locks in my list.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.560]   Of course, I used lip lock to register.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.720]   Oh, you know what?
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.000]   When I started a new podcast, it's just a little anchor thing.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.440]   This was some time ago.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.880]   I called it Leo on the line, and what did I register?
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.320]   Well, I went L-O-T-L.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.520]   What can I get?
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.760]   And I found L-O-T-L dot fun.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.360]   Lottle fun.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.520]   I could do Lottle online, Lottle art, Lottle live.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.680]   Lottle wiki is on sale right now.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.640]   Lottle-- I have a number of wikis because I love wikis.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.760]   .net.co.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.400]   And then they give you a lot of other recommendations.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.840]   It's just so much fun.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.600]   Type in something you're looking for.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.720]   You'll be blown away.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.200]   Lottle.computer.dev.hosting.io.network.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.720]   That page site software solution systems technology website,
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.000]   and that's just the text section.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.640]   You get-- it's fun.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.680]   10% off your first purchase of any domain extension
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.120]   for the entire first year.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.120]   Hover.com/twit.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.880]   10% off your first purchase right now.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.480]   Hover.com/twit.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.640]   I admitted I'm a domain hoarder.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.680]   OK, I said it.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.040]   Hover.com/twit.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.400]   On that we go with the show.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.120]   You know, this is related.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.040]   It's not an Apple story specifically,
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   but Spotify announced a new bit of hardware today called
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.000]   the Spotify car thing.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.080]   This is for people with older cars,
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:41.240]   but it is a device that you put in your car using
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.920]   and you can Bluetooth pair to it.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920]   And it's free for people.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.840]   I mean, you have to get into the early beta,
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.200]   but it's free for an early beta.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.720]   It's got a big old knob on it.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.680]   But this guy's put it on his vent of his car.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.840]   And obviously you can only listen to Spotify for it.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:02.600]   It's they say not meant to compete with in car infotainment systems.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.160]   It's another step in our larger ubiquity strategy.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.040]   That's interesting.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.720]   Creating a truly frictionless audio experience for our users,
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.720]   wherever they are and however they choose to listen.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.640]   Imagine that refrigerator thing, a microwave oven thing,
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:21.400]   a bike thing uses voice control.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.640]   There's a dial preset buttons.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.840]   It's just basically, I think this is to replace the car radio.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.960]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.040]   Let's see what else.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.360]   Else.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:41.160]   I know no one else cares, but Linux support for the M1
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.720]   may be on its way in by June.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.680]   Why you would put Linux on an app, a Mac, I don't know.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.040]   But if you wanted to, you could.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.000]   This is because there's a thing about this.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:53.560]   I think about it.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.560]   It's like a state of maturity of the system.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.360]   It is, isn't it?
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.320]   So they obviously, they say.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.000]   Also, it's a way to keep, sorry.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.800]   No, please go.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.080]   I was just going to say it's also a way to maintain the investment in the hardware,
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.840]   because five or ten years later, it will probably not be able to run anything.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.640]   Which is a big deal if you are straight for funds,
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.840]   like a government or education or something like that.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.680]   I have like 10 year old Mac books that are running Linux right now,
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.880]   because they're useful.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.000]   They're still wonderful machines.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:31.000]   This will be in Linux kernel 5.13, which is in development right now.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.840]   But it's complicated.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.640]   I mean, not only do you have to support the M1 processor,
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.600]   but you also have to support, and this is actually the harder thing,
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.160]   a variety of other chips in there.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   And so it is not an easy thing to do,
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.200]   but I have seen some people already booting up Linux on an M1 Macintosh.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.760]   It may be official in Linux by June.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.880]   Let's see.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.320]   Head of engineering for Apple's retail, departing the company after 10 years.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.840]   Deogo Rao.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:10.200]   If he's been there 10 years, that means he did the web objects for the ship of the store.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.640]   Poor guy.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:17.800]   He's going to become senior vice president and chief information and digital officer at Eli Lilly.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.600]   Didn't lock run that project.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:20.840]   Wasn't it?
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.920]   Michael Lop's original project was the App Store.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:23.560]   I forget now.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.120]   Not the App Store.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.680]   Sorry, the Apple's retail store online.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.040]   Oh, this is not the store on this is Apple retail.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.000]   So oh, that's interesting.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:33.400]   Yeah, mortar.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.000]   So what is he do?
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.640]   What what's what engineering do you need to do for that?
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.040]   I guess.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.360]   I don't know.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.320]   I guess it really depends.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.840]   Like he could flow of people, design of store, implementation of
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.960]   yeah, tons of things that they have.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.720]   Well, then they care that I'm really not qualified for.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.200]   Data measure.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.640]   That little thing on their hip, right?
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.600]   So they check you out.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.320]   That's probably there's probably a big back end involved.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.320]   Easy pay, which is neither easy nor pay.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:03.160]   This is sort of a tangential Apple story.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.040]   Nuance, which was originally the intelligence behind Siri in the early days.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.840]   Eventually, Apple replaced it with their own hardware.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:18.360]   Nuance has just been acquired by Microsoft for 19.7 billion dollars.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:22.760]   All cash on the Twitter.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.320]   I like it to the little fish eating by being in by a bigger fish by a bigger fish by a bigger fish
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.600]   because nuance acquired all the speech to text companies.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.960]   They you know, they kind of brought it all under the nuance fold,
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.560]   including drag in another's effect.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.440]   I wonder, did they buy learn out in House B, which was Microsoft's speech to text platform?
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.000]   They might have.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.440]   And although all those fishes got eaten and now Microsoft's going to eat them all.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.640]   Nuance is used by 55% of physicians, 75% of radiologists have my friend,
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.760]   he's a radiologist.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.880]   It works with your dragon.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.160]   Naturally speaking, for radiology works very, very well.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.000]   77% of US hospitals.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.280]   Health care is a big part of that business.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.920]   And it'll be, of course, tied in with Microsoft Cloud for healthcare.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.720]   And I think it is market acquisition because Microsoft's technology in that area is very
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.200]   good.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:12.520]   Right.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.240]   Really good.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.160]   And so I think it's more about getting it's I think it's also a defensive move.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.440]   You know, Microsoft and Google are in the voice recognition are, you know, miles in front of
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.400]   everybody else.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.240]   And so I think that makes sure that kind of breaks off all the last branches.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:29.000]   You're going to have to develop it yourself.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.880]   So there's there's some defensive moves, some market moves.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:32.440]   Interesting.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.680]   Some extra technology that will benefit Microsoft pulling up the ladder after Siri.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:44.840]   But largely getting access to the medical market, the nuance is the gold standard
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.840]   when it comes to that kind of technology where they, God bless them.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.280]   They earlier on, they realized that, okay, it's kind of nice that we can
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.920]   sell this app with this little boom headset that will let executives dictate letters and stuff.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:02.120]   But actually, where we're medical, the medical community has lots and lots of money for
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.080]   projects like this.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.920]   If we are the only one that's actually paying attention to their needs to make sure that
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:12.440]   we can actually process all the 18 syllable drug words that they have to use every single day,
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:16.040]   we will basically be, we will absolutely run the table.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.120]   So it's not just having this technology.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:22.600]   It's also having this entry into the medical market for Microsoft with a lot of really smart
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.360]   people that don't necessarily type really well.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.160]   True.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.280]   Don't they're all dragon dictating.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.080]   And running recognition.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:29.800]   That's that's the.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.200]   How are you going to?
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.640]   I don't understand how you use this.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.000]   Scan this QR code with your iPhone.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.280]   And you can see what it's like to run a, a, a Samsung.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.240]   I'm going to try this now.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.280]   Open.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:50.680]   I test that and see it's a web app and it's going to turn my iPhone into a Samsung device.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.120]   Really?
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:52.920]   It's going to be a deep drops cry.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.480]   I mean, really?
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.040]   Wow.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.680]   So now I have to, okay, I'm on the page.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.360]   I'm going to add it to my home screen.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.760]   Samsung eye test.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:05.400]   And now get ready.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.120]   Stand back.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.440]   My iPhone.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:08.840]   Oh no.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.440]   I'm really wanting to.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.720]   It's more like I tested this.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.840]   I, I, I did.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.720]   Oh my God.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.600]   That's creepy.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.120]   I've turned my iPhone into a Samsung device.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.200]   So somehow, somehow I think Samsung thinks that would, that would have iPhone users.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.000]   Want to use it.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:23.480]   Look at it.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:23.800]   More.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:23.880]   Okay.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.040]   Compare this to this.
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.680]   It's like, it's like drag race.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.640]   Only for handsets.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.520]   At least it's not touch whiz.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.520]   It's not touch whiz?
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.680]   No, what do they call it now?
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.560]   It says,
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.400]   does everything looks like everything works?
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:41.880]   The phone?
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:45.800]   Maybe this is the solution for getting my text messages.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.320]   Maybe.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.400]   Look, I can even use the camera.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.760]   Some picture of some guy who's not even here.
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.680]   That's, that's really cool.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:56.760]   Why would I want this guy's pictures?
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.440]   I guess it's just, this is just a test.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.960]   I hope.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:00.840]   It's a demo.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.280]   I hope this is only a test.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.880]   You can feel like a carrier store.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:04.280]   You're right.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.600]   I have a feeling this is not going to have the effect.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.160]   That's absolutely what you think it means.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:15.800]   Well, it's, it really is interesting though.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:19.640]   If you, if you're dealing with people who have never used Android before,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.280]   and maybe they've grown up inside the,
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:26.680]   only, only walking through the, the, the iPhone habit rails,
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.760]   and they think, oh, well, Android is nothing like the iPhone.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.360]   And it's just, it's hard to use.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.160]   And it's like, well, actually, no, it's almost exactly the same way.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.480]   It works almost exactly like the iPhone does,
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.280]   just a different like accent on things.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.120]   And I've liked, I would love to see them kind of go further with this.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.080]   I would, I would love to see this actually being applied to everywhere.
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.720]   Saying I don't, I don't want to emulate windows,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:50.200]   but I want, give me an environment where I can at least play,
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.720]   and see what windows is actually like by downloading,
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.520]   or excuse me, by, by maximizing a web browser window,
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.440]   as opposed to having to install something.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.240]   And maybe I'll realize that, oh, actually that doesn't stink at all.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:05.080]   Apparently I have, I have new friends, a guy named Sam,
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.040]   and a generic friend won.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.880]   I just hope that they will be using this.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:12.840]   As telling stuff.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:13.960]   I know I look stupid.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.400]   I know it's a website, but it's a really kind of well done website
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:21.080]   that makes it kind of look like you're using a Samsung phone.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.360]   So, but it is just a website.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.880]   I just wish that they would like, they, they, you know, they, they, they,
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.120]   they lent into a lot of really mundane sort of things there,
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.720]   which is maybe the fairest way of doing it.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.160]   But I would have like found every little thing that makes us beat iPhone
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.800]   and made that my web demo, like just shock and awe you,
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.840]   and you load it up and say, I want that, like just wow me.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.280]   And it's kind of pedestrian.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.520]   It's my only quibble with it.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.120]   Yeah, it's interesting though.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.520]   I mean, you know, it, it kind of gives you that.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.000]   It's such a weird thing to see this on my iPhone.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.800]   That's because I have Samsung phones.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.640]   I mean, I recognize that, that interface,
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.200]   which I immediately get rid of, by the way, suits I can.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.000]   Samsung phone, I use a different launcher.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.280]   So it's not, it's, I don't think it's a progressive web app.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.520]   I think it's just a, just a website.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.760]   Because it's not, it's actually not doing anything.
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.440]   The camera doesn't really do anything.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.080]   The messages don't really do anything.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.760]   Somebody's kids are on here.
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:18.120]   So, so, so essentially it's about as functional as the, as the
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:22.760]   iPhones that Steve Jobs demonstrated when they first, when they did the first live demo in January.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:23.480]   Yeah, it's pretty fun.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.880]   It only does a few things, most of it is static text.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.280]   And it'll crash if you go the wrong way.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.000]   It's pretty funny.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.160]   Some, this is my generic friend.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.000]   Sent me a GIF.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   It's nice, it's nice to be able to simulate being one of those people who have friends who
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.320]   like text them with funny, funny, funny memes and stuff.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.760]   Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.480]   Oh, look, I'm out for, I'm out for a walk on a, outside, on a, on a lakeside bridge with
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:51.720]   someone who seems to have his life together.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.440]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.880]   Um, HomePod still available.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.560]   If you want a quick snap one up, it is discontinued.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:05.480]   But apparently, according to nine to five Mac, you can, you can still go to the store.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.840]   Uh, the white HomePod is still being sold everywhere in the US.
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.480]   Honestly, this might explain why they discontinued it.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:17.240]   Because even after this continued it, they still have plenty of stock.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:22.600]   The space gray one went fast, but a lot of people, a lot of, a lot of nerds panicked and
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.360]   said, I'll never get my stereo pair.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:24.920]   That's what he meant.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.600]   Oh yeah, because they already bought the space gray.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.800]   So they have to get the second one.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.160]   Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:36.120]   Um, and, and a couple of people tweeted that the HomePod that they had purchased
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.600]   is from the original launch stock.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:45.240]   So it, it, it kind of implies that after three years, uh, Apple didn't even have to make any
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:45.720]   new ones.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.760]   They were very optimistic.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:48.680]   Yikes.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.080]   It was, it was the price, right?
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.960]   Cause I, I bet you the mini selling hotcakes.
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.320]   It was a price and it was serious.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.360]   I think it was serious wasn't competitive with the other assistants and the price wasn't
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.960]   competitive with the other speakers and both those things made it, continuously bad.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:03.480]   All right.
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:07.240]   I, I, I look and win on experience, but they didn't play the experience game on this one.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.680]   It was just a sound game.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.160]   No, they played the sound game and you remember that briefing they gave you.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.320]   I mean, it was like, we, we, we've put more energy into figuring out how sound works and
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.840]   we're going to, this thing is amazing.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.880]   And I guess it just, it didn't convince anybody, I guess.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.200]   They brought us $700, well, not 70.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:25.640]   They brought a $500 speaker to a $50 home assistant.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:25.960]   Right.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.440]   It's more a comment, frankly, on our bad ears than it is on Apple's bad choices.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.760]   Uh, let's, uh, get ready for the picks of the week, shall we?
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.200]   Got some good ones this week, I think.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:38.520]   Oh yeah.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:41.720]   Our picks of the week, let's kick it off.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.320]   I'm going to start at the high end.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.160]   Alex Lindsey, you can, you can kick it off.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.000]   Mine's not that expensive.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:47.880]   I know, I know.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.520]   I always tease it.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:48.920]   Oh, wait.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.120]   I can, I can.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:56.840]   As I continue to play with, uh, LIDAR on the phone, um, because as you know, I think that
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.960]   they are.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.240]   I heard it's the next big thing.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:36:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:03.880]   Anyway, so I've been playing with Polycam and I, and I think, so I've been talking to,
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.120]   um, a lot of folks about it.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:12.120]   Um, one of my, uh, close friends, Fred, Fred Fiker is, uh, in, uh, you know, AEC really
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.120]   dealing with engineering architecture construction and, and he recommended, I,
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.080]   I really take a look at this and I started playing with it and it's unbelievable.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:24.760]   So, um, Polycam is basically, there's something about it that's really interesting.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.480]   Is that you, you start waving it around and I was, I was up in goat rock and
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:32.920]   but I could, it's kind of my little test area for a lot of this stuff.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:38.200]   And I, I just started going along a cliff face and it just, you know, of course,
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.680]   it shows you what you're grabbing and what you're not grabbing.
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:43.480]   So it keeps on building the model live while you're doing it.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.760]   And it, you know, it looks great.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.200]   It just kind of, it shows the mess as the poly guns, right?
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.520]   That the, yeah, see, you can see how the, as those polygons are, it just paints them.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.360]   So it's just showing you how it out appears.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.120]   So it makes it really easy to capture it.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.680]   I was, I was really amazed by how well it was tracking with it.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.120]   Um, but what's really interesting is, is that we're starting to see what I think
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:07.800]   is going to be the beginning of the next generation of this, which is that when you hit save,
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:14.280]   it shows you your, your camera path and all the little representation of little camera positions.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.760]   Now the reason that that's important is that I believe that it means that they are getting ready
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.440]   to incorporate a mixture of a photogrammetry with LiDAR.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.560]   That's really where things start to get really interesting because what happens is, is that
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.800]   you're, if you're able to mix those two together, you get the accuracy of LiDAR with a detail of
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:37.560]   photogrammetry and you're going to be able to get incredible detail out of the, um, out,
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.000]   you know, out of these images because the imagery coming out of, coming to the phone is a lot
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:47.880]   denser than the, than the LiDAR itself. And so being able to figure that out, um, and it,
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.840]   I have found that doesn't work as well in an office where there's shiny things and really flat
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:57.400]   things, but if you take it out and do things that are more organic or outdoor, it, it grabs on to
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.880]   things amazingly well. Anyway, so look at this. So I did it. Obviously I didn't do it very well.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:08.280]   And then you press process and it gives you a 3D model, obviously not the best,
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.720]   most detailed model. If I'd held it longer to give it more polygons, would it have done a better job?
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.560]   Yeah. Yeah. You have to kind of follow it along, but you can also, um, you know, you can export this
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.440]   as a U-D-Z for instance, right? And then you could text it, I could text it to you or text it to me,
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:30.600]   and literally it'll pop up in front of you in to scale. It's kind of an amazing, amazing thing.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.400]   And so, uh, I was moving the camera. Is that a bad idea? No, you have to. You have to.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:39.080]   Okay. You don't, you, yeah, you'll move it around, but they have.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.520]   Move it around and it's going to build the model as I continue to move it.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:46.120]   Yeah, you'll see it. You'll see it kind of painting the, painting the data in there.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:52.280]   But it's, it's, it's not that expensive. It's, it's got a lot of export options,
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:56.360]   which is really important to me. So, so you're able to, um, if you get the pro version,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.680]   which is like, I don't know, it's like $40 a year or something like that. So,
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.480]   or set eight bucks a month or something. So it's, you know, it is a, it's kind of
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.240]   cool. You can see it building the model, which is really interesting. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:15.800]   You can see the building up. The word, the word is, is that this is the one that, you know,
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:20.200]   a lot of folks are, this is probably the most detailed one right now. So if you want to dig
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.800]   into it, you know, eight bucks for a month and you can play with it, you can play with it for free.
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.560]   So there's a lot of the little things you can play with now. You don't need to get the pro
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.840]   version. So that's the cool thing. You can download it for free. If you decide you want to
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:34.280]   play with it with a month, you can, the best thing to do is you sign up for a month with all of
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.920]   these things now. I sign up for a month and then I go up and cancel the next day. I will set a
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.880]   little thing in it. And then I, I can decide whether I'm going to keep going, but I don't leave it.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.200]   Otherwise you end up paying for a lot of people. The cap gives you, the payment gives you a, uh,
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.120]   poly cam account and you can share and see what other people are doing and all that stuff.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.000]   But you can get all the experience as I'm doing right now. Exactly. Exactly. So you can,
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   you can get it now. You can play with it for free and, and see what it does. And it's,
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.800]   I would highly recommend keeping, there's a future that's going to be pretty exciting when
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:10.360]   this stuff really starts to mature and it's maturing quickly. You can also watch it. I did a much
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.680]   bigger one this time and I can actually watching it process it. So it actually works through it.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.280]   That's cool. Yeah. That's really cool. Yeah. It's fun. So now I have a 3D model of the set. I could
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:27.480]   print it, put it on my table and inception. Poly cam. Obviously you have to have one of the iPhones
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:35.160]   or iPads with a LIDAR on it. You own 12 only. It wouldn't be much fun. Otherwise. Well, I was
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:39.960]   looking for an excuse to buy a new iPad next week. I guess how you got one Andy and I go pick of
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:47.000]   the week. Um, I, you know, there, there are times when you keep going back and forth and you can't
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.040]   justify a certain expense. But then you've just realized that how many times have I said,
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.160]   I can't justify this expense. This is just a toy, just an amusement. And I could say, well,
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:02.440]   okay, hop up for every 10 of those that you say no to. You say yes to one. And so ladies and
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:11.720]   gentlemen. Oh, it's a Lego project. The Lego space shuttle discovery. Oh, pieces. It was just
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.920]   released like last week. I can't, I can't even get the whole box in the frame. My golly. I got the box
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:23.000]   right here. Wow. Yeah. And this, and this is like exactly what I was hoping for when it came to.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.640]   Do you also get the Hubble is Hubble Space Telescope included? Oh, yes. Oh, wait a minute. You get
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:35.800]   the arm. You can actually deploy the Hubble Space Telescope in your living room. There's so much,
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.240]   this is so well thought out because as a matter of fact, not only that, but they did something
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.720]   smart enough. So this is the, this is the like instruction book. This is the assembly manual.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.760]   But this, this is how much they, they, they love you as a consumer and they understand like how
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:57.560]   your brain works. Okay. Like the first, they, they put like everything for the Hubble, like in
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.440]   different bags, they're totally separate from smart from the spatial. So if you just want to,
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:06.760]   like, I'm gonna, I'm, I want to start off light, I'm going to start off with the Hubble. But as you
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:10.760]   can see, there are so many different ways you can set these things up. They give you separate
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.800]   stands so that you can have this, the shuttle and the Hubble, like on different display stands with
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:22.520]   different like placards on them. You can have the, the, the Hubble on the end of the Canadarm,
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:28.120]   like it's being put into, put into orbit. You can have it like all folded up in the, in the, in the,
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:34.920]   in the cargo bay. And the, yep, the doors open, the doors, the doors close. The, the, the airbreak on
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:41.240]   the back of the shuttle, like actually opens and deploys. You can pop off the top and actually look
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:48.040]   at both decks of the crew compartments. This is, this is, I have been sort of like, I, this is,
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:55.160]   this is my sort of, this is my prize for having passed on the whatever that ultimate millennium
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:00.040]   Falcon kit was. Oh, we had that. Yeah. Because that was like 500 bucks. And I'm like, I'm not
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.920]   gonna, I can't spend 500 bucks on a Lego kit. So this was like two, this was only 200 bucks.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:10.760]   But the thing is, I have, and it's not the dollars. It's the hours. It's not the dollars,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.080]   but also, and I also, I'm hoping you're gonna time lapse it. That's all I'm saying. No, no, look,
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:20.280]   I mean, look how cool like the contours of this thing are. Like this is, they didn't cheat by,
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.400]   they didn't, they didn't disappoint you by making okay. Well, this is sort of like a low poly version
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.680]   of the space shuttle. But neither did they say, well, we came up with 180 different custom new
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:36.440]   Lego parts. So that looks like it still looks and feels like Lego. But the, well, I'll tell you
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:42.280]   the other thing that that that sealed the deal that I got, I got shot at my first Pfizer shot
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:49.320]   last week. So I'm gonna be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. And most people, most of my
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:54.280]   friends in New England are probably gonna be in the same boat. So I'm like, I did open this up so
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.040]   I could like show it to you. But I'm like, you know what, I'm not gonna start building it myself.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.040]   I'm gonna like invite like six friends over and we're gonna knock this all out in one night.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.240]   That's a good idea. This is gonna be my reintroduction to like people, friends.
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:15.560]   Enjoying food together. I stopped buying these big Lego models when we lost Jeff Needles, who was,
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:20.920]   was he an interner employee? I can't remember, but he was the only guy willing. This is the death
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:26.520]   star being assembled. And a time lapse we did over, I don't know, his shirt changes several times,
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:31.960]   so it must be several. They did animation. So the little Lego figures too. Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:36.280]   That's good. That's the only way they could have made this better. It isn't the right scale for
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.760]   mini figs. You can't act. And I didn't know this. I actually bought like Star Wars mini figs. So
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.560]   I could have like the Star Wars crew, like crewing the spatial. Oh, you can't? But no, well, it's, I
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:49.640]   mean, the thing would have been like what, like 10 meters long if they had made it correct scale
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:55.240]   for for mini figures. So it's so, but it's still like a big hunger dungus. Like it really is about
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:01.400]   like this big when it's actually fully built. So and yeah, this is this is going to be have point
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:07.080]   of pride somewhere on my living room. Time lapse. You could probably do a better job.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.240]   What would your frame rate be? This ours feels like it's a little jerky. What frame rate? Show
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:18.120]   this is another one. This is the, this is another Star Wars thing. He's building. How long do you
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:24.760]   think it would? How long do you think it would it would take you to build it? I'm guessing three
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:30.200]   or four nights of like three or four hour sessions. I haven't done many big Lego kits. As
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:35.560]   matter of fact, they they gave you because it was if you buy from the from the from lego.com,
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:39.640]   like they give you because it's like now $200, you get like a couple of free kits with it.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:42.040]   And so this is I'm going to be using this like as my trainer.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.800]   This really happened. Oh, that's good. Start with the eight plus version. Yeah.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.520]   Exactly. I'm going to work my way up to it and like get the Calc's on my fingertips.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:57.240]   But and you're right that that will give me like an idea of like how long it's going to take me to
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:08.040]   put together the 2000 and 2354 pieces and with decals. They give you these metal foil decals
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:14.120]   for the solar panels on on the Hubble as well as the heat reflective material on the inside of
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:19.240]   the shuttle bay. So yeah, it's it's going to be a thing. It's going to be Hootenanny for friends.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:26.600]   Jeff Needles built that in 2013, Anthony Nielsen, of course, shooting and editing. And you can see
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:32.120]   how low rest those cameras were we were using. I mean, the way I would do it is probably two or three
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:38.920]   GoPros at 4k video because then you can then frame blend them to get motion blur.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.200]   Okay, so we need to I have one GoPro. We need three more.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:51.080]   So I'll say I'll say I'm Deannie. So so we're going to so basically I'm going to turn up on
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.840]   office hours sometime this week. We'll discuss like the best way to do this.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.920]   Yes. I'll shoot your leg on build. That would be a good office hours.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:02.760]   Well, here's what the thing is is that when I was looking at I was like, wow, we could do a
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.280]   whole bunch of it. We all a bunch of us buy it. We all just do it over zoom.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:15.960]   Oh, my, my, my. Renee Richard. Sorry. Sorry, children of people who do office hours.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:19.560]   That's another four weeks. You're not going to be seeing your mom or your dad.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.800]   It's exactly exactly. All I got to say is put it somewhere where
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:29.000]   children and earthquakes can't get to it because I think both the deaths are
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.920]   and the battle cruiser were later dismantled by small children. They took a hit, but lots of good
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:41.480]   pieces. Renee Richie, your pick of the week. So I did this just so I can hand off very quickly
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.920]   to Alex Lindsay to explain the true ramifications of it. But today as part of their ongoing announcement
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:52.600]   series, Maxan announced redshift as come to the Mac. It's coming to the Intel Mac right now.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.480]   And when Apple puts out, I think it's the 12 dot the 11 dot three update, it will be coming to the
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.600]   M1 Max as well. Basically, you've taken redshift and they've rewritten it for metal. So there,
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:08.040]   it's going right on the Intel Mac because metal doesn't care about your silicon. It just,
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.160]   it has a job to be done. It's going to do it. And then as soon as the updates out,
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.680]   that brings the features they need to the M1 version as well, it'll be good to go there.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:20.840]   And for them, I had a chance to sit down and talk to the CEO of Maxomen to some of the
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:27.560]   people using redshift. I'll have that video up fairly soon. But it was just exciting to hear,
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.920]   because a lot of times you just hear like people just want CUDA cores, they just want PCs. And
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.400]   they were saying they see a big uptake in like people loves cinema 4D on the Mac. They really
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:40.440]   want to have redshift because the idea of offloading to GPU rendering, just the size of the files
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:46.360]   that they have, it takes them down from hours and hours to minutes and minutes. And it makes
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.560]   such a difference in their pipeline and the ability to grow this as Apple continues to grow
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.600]   out metal and what they're able to do with Apple GPUs in the future. It just sounds
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.000]   really, really exciting. And their whole thing is we've gone to almost real-time editing.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.880]   And they just want to get to a point where generating all this 3D rendering is closer and
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.680]   closer to real-time. Well, that really says something about the GPUs in the M1, if they can get a speed bump
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:15.480]   like that. That's really interesting. I mean, the thing that Maxomen's been good at for a long,
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.400]   long time is really taking them, getting the most out of the hardware. And the other thing is,
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.120]   you know, really German engineering, you end up with things that are solid. So when they start
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.360]   releasing things for it, they don't go, "Oh, we boarded it over and I think it'll work okay."
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.920]   It's going to really work. And redshift is one of the top renderers out there. And so
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:41.080]   Maxon acquired it a couple years ago. And so the mixture of this is pretty exciting.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:46.120]   I think that being able to do it on the Mac Mini is a good start. What's going to be exciting is
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:51.400]   watching it as Renee said, grow into the Mac Pro and into the other things that are going out.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:58.200]   A benchmark for future M1 chips or Apple Silicon chips, you know, how much faster is it?
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.840]   That's really interesting. I think that's going to be exciting.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.200]   Yeah, it's going to be very, well, it'll be telling.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:05.800]   They also acquired Forager, which is super exciting too. And that lets you use the Apple
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.280]   Pencil and the iPad Pro to sculpt 3D models. And they're all in on Apple's ecosystem where
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.120]   you can move between devices and the idea of sculpting something with your Apple Pencil.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:19.080]   Moving over to Cinema 4D, you're putting it into Redshift. I think made them really excited just to
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:25.400]   be there. Yeah. So I mean, Alex, is that a fairly popular tool for...
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:31.480]   It's not in the high-end area. A lot of people are still using Z-rush and a couple other things.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:37.720]   But Forager has been around for a long time on the iPad. And so I think taking that technology
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:41.480]   and incorporating into what Maxon does, I think they're going to be able to keep on expanding what
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:47.160]   it does. With mixing what Maxon has with what Forager has, I think is going to be really,
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:52.520]   really interesting. And it's going to probably... A lot of people are probably using it. It's going
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:52:00.120]   to be a great... It's really, really a great mix of tech there. So I think it's going to be exciting.
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:04.600]   And it's a really fun way to model. I'm... Whether it's Forager, which I've had
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.960]   pretty much since they released it, as well as Z-rush. Those kinds of modeling techniques
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:17.320]   are really exciting. And again, it'll be interesting to see how quickly that stuff starts to hit AR.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:21.000]   I know that I keep on talking about that. But it's going to be like being able to model
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:27.480]   something right in front of you is going to be really interesting. It'll be much more organic.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:31.560]   So getting into that technology and making sure that they understand how that works is also useful.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:36.120]   I can't wait for Mac Break Weekly 2025 when you get to say I told you so. C.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.800]   C.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:40.440]   And AR. He'll be sitting next to you in AR till you'll see.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:40.840]   C.
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:45.000]   No, it'll be his avatar because he's got six shows going at the same time.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:52.920]   My pick of the week very quickly, FCC has released its first app for the iPhone. It's a broadband
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:53:00.360]   test app and it's free. And they're collecting information. It's more than just finding out how
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.600]   fast your mobile internet is. They're collecting this information because that I think this is a
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:10.520]   very important part of the FCC's mandate. They really want to improve bandwidth all across the
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:15.960]   country. So when you first set it up, they say we don't want to overload your mobile data.
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:21.480]   So you can choose what the limit is. I'm just going to say it's unlimited because I have unlimited
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:28.280]   data and I'm going to allow mobile data use. You can test, I'm actually on Wi-Fi, but you can
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:33.560]   test upload, download, latency, jitter and packet loss. Those are by the way, important.
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:38.040]   Oh, I don't seem to be able to tap those. But those are really important for Skype and other
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:43.160]   things. So it's a very good thing to be able to test that. Now, of course, I'm on a fast Wi-Fi
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.840]   right now. So I don't think this is going to be a good test of my mobile carrier. But the
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:53.160]   information gets uploaded to the FCC where they're now keeping track of bandwidth access all over
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.000]   the country. I think that's important.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.120]   Well, and before you test it, before you test your bandwidth, I highly recommend calling your
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:06.920]   provider and asking for their retention manager. When you find out what you're saying is when
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:13.000]   you find out how crappy it is. Well, no, the thing is that you, so I had with Comcast, we had
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.920]   275 down and 10 up. And I just was like, I need to find a better solution. This isn't going to
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:25.960]   work. So my wife called and now we have one gig down and 35 up and it cost $30 less than it did
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:31.880]   before. I was stunned. I didn't even know they had gigabit service in Petaloo.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:38.280]   And when I put in the ubiquity stuff, the installer said, oh, yeah, you can get gigabit.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:41.480]   I said, what? And I said, would you call? Because I don't want to talk to those guys.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:47.400]   And so we have gigabit. It's very good. We have 10 gigabit here on SonicNet. I'm not getting
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:53.800]   quite that on my iPhone, but 268 down and 178 up. I did reach out to Sonic. It was I was
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.000]   trying to figure out it's too expensive to come to where I am. I have to have a pretty
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.120]   10-inch. But I did was trying to get Sonic first and just didn't.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:09.160]   Zero packet loss, 15.2 millisecond jitter, 24.5 millisecond latency. That's kind of bad.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:13.800]   But now if I really wanted to test mobile, I could turn off the Wi-Fi and see the mobile as well,
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:19.320]   which is I bet you pretty good because I think I now I'm getting a T-Mobile 5G in our studios,
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:25.960]   which we did not have before. So FCC speed test, iOS and Android, and it will actually
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:32.520]   upload the information to the FCC because they're trying to keep an eye on how fast
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:39.160]   internet is really for reels. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now concluding this thrilling gripping
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.720]   edition of Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie, you didn't get a call during the show.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:52.600]   No. I'm relieved. Good. But you may get a call anytime soon and we will be back here next
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:59.000]   week to talk about what Apple announces. Renee Richie's video channel is youtube.com/Renee.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.920]   Richie, anything you want to plug? I should have a video up about the event
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:08.520]   soonish and then I'll have a video up about Redshift on Mac talking to some of the
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:17.240]   Max on folks tomorrow. Nice. I look forward to that. They're good people. Yeah. Mr. Andy Ennaco,
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:24.440]   you're on WGBH in Boston. When? That's going to be Thursday at 1230 in the afternoon on the East
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:32.920]   Coast. You can go to WGBH News.org to stream it live or later. How nice. And everybody must be
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:41.400]   in office hours because otherwise why would he be doing it 24 hours a day? Go to youtube.com/AlexLinsie
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:50.520]   L-I-N-D-S-A-Y. Anything you want to plug at this point? Just office hours just keeps getting
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.080]   better. So it's like every, clearly it's better than the last week. I don't understand how that
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.920]   works. I can't wait for Saturday's cooking. Saturday's cooking. Yeah. So we're doing it on
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:04.280]   YouTube with Matt in the kitchen. So it's Madeline Smithberg. She used to be the producer for
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:13.960]   The Daily Show with John Stewart. And so she's the host and she's cooking with a chef. We're making
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.960]   kimchi pancakes. Oh, that's weird. Anyway, so we're going to make them together.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.640]   And there's going to be a whole bunch of us. It's going to be so you can... You can usually
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:27.400]   put the coz in my pancakes, but okay. Exactly. Yeah. If you jump into office hours,
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.320]   you can... Here's the crazy thing is there's three shows going on at the same time.
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:36.200]   Because one show wasn't enough. So there's one show that looks like... One other words, 24
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.720]   hours in the day was sufficient. Yeah. Let's make it 72 hours a day. But yeah, exactly. So here's
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:48.280]   how it works. There's one show that has the chef and Madeline and a couple people that we know
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:54.440]   are pretty well set up for cooking. So that's one show that goes to YouTube. Then there's another
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:57.720]   show where everybody's cooking together. They just have a whole bunch of stuff open and they're all
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:00.440]   cooking and Madeline's going to come in and say hi and she'll come in at the beginning and she'll
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.440]   come in a couple of times during it and check in and see how everybody's doing. And then there's
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.240]   another show where we're showing the multi-view from my switcher and you get to listen to comms.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.280]   So you'll just hear me calling cameras and talking about things and other people doing that. So all
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.720]   three shows are happening at the same time. So you can decide what kind of content you want to watch
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:24.120]   and all of it that will be interesting, I think. So anyway, we're going to do it eight weeks in a
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:28.520]   row. And the first one will be probably a little rough, but it'll get better over eight weeks.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:33.480]   We're kind of testing these formats right now. So that's very nice. It's very, very nice.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:40.200]   Thank you everybody for joining us. MacBreak Weekly is a Tuesday morning production, 11am
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:47.640]   Pacific 2pm Eastern Time 20. Let's see, 1800 UTC. If you want to watch us live, you can't at
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:51.800]   twitter.tv/live. We had a little hiccup in the live stream in the middle, but we got it back.
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:58.360]   And the way I know that is because the chatroom watches live at irc.twit.tv.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:05.160]   So if you're watching live or listening live at twitter.tv/live chat with us live at irc.twit.tv.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:11.160]   After the fact, we always make everything we do on demand, download it at twitter.tv.
[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:15.720]   In this case, twitter.tv/mbw. If you want to go right to the show page,
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:22.120]   you can also see the budget buttons Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, pocket casts. You can subscribe
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:27.240]   Spotify. There's also a YouTube channel. You just click that YouTube link and you could subscribe
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:34.120]   to our YouTube channel. All of that at twitter.tv/mbw. If you subscribe to pocket casts or Apple or
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:39.080]   Google podcasts, you'll get it automatically every Tuesday. That's a very convenient feature.
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:43.320]   And by the way, it would be really nice if you left a review for us on those.
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:48.120]   Only five stars, please. Only five star reviews.
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:51.960]   Five stars are better. We're sorry that you can only give us five stars.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:55.400]   Yeah. That's what we're saying. But hey, you've got to work within the system.
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:58.920]   We're good enough for more, but since that's the limit, just give us five.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.240]   Don't break any rules. I know you want to.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:10.280]   Thank you all for being here. Again, next week, we start early for the Apple stream at 10am
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:15.960]   Pacific time and we'll be covering that and of course, Mac break weekly immediately after,
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:21.240]   which I guess is going to be about 11. They've been pretty tight on these filmed streams,
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:28.200]   videoed streams. Also, we're hoping to make a little bit of an announcement about the future of the
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:34.600]   network on Sunday, on the Sunday Twit. If all goes well, the minimal hiccups, but we're preparing
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.720]   something we think you'll like. So stay tuned for that or tune in for that and I'll talk about it
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:44.840]   next week as well on Mac break weekly. Thank you, everybody for joining us. We'll see you next time.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.920]   Now it's time to get back to work. Mac break is over.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:55.960]   Hey, I hope you enjoyed that episode. If you are interested in checking out all things smart home
