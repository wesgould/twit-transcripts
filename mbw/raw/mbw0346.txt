[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andy and Renee are here. We're going to talk about the new Facebook for iOS.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   How exciting is that? Well, also take a look at Lightroom 5 and ask the very important question.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.800]   Will you be able to update it on the App Store? It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover your Macintosh needs in deep, not really because there's nothing to talk about with them.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   I apologize. This is basically an iOS show. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll find some Mac stuff to talk about.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400]   Annie and not go is here for the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   I don't know how we can live up to that incredible build-up you give to the show.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   I realized as I started saying it, I don't know what Mac stuff we could talk about.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   There's one story. Thank you.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   Chad tries to find one every time.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Or we could talk about what we feel is important in the Mac industry today.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   But there are things we like.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   10.8.4. We could talk about that.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   Also, there you go. All your Mac needs covered here.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Also, Renee Richie from Canada. I'm more.com via Montreal. Hello, Renee.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   I think a good podcaster doesn't get Mac stories.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   Leo, a good podcaster makes Mac stories.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   And therein lies the rumor mill.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   We should do with Renee.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   Renee, I'm more is now become the number one place for getting reliable rumors.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   You're not the digitimes of rumors. You're credible.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   We try to sort them.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   Anything credible on the horizon.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   We're starting to see now delays on the iPhone to September maybe later.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   We heard some people heard June, July, August this closer, maybe a little out.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   But I think this year, the case thing is going to be the same as the iPhone 5
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   that is more software related.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   That's puzzling because the story I read implied there was a manufacturer problem.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   But that can't be true.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   I haven't heard anything about that. All I've heard is the same thing.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   Some other people have heard is that they're all in on iOS.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   They're moving Mac engineers into iOS to help them get it ready.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   They had that change in management.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   Scott Forest calls out Johnny I was in.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   So there's reasons why it could be taking a long time.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   And by the way, congratulations to snagging Peter Cohen, who is great.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   Oh, thank you very much.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   He's awesome.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   He's been covering gaming since I was a young lad.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   And he's going to be doing gaming for us.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   And he's going to be doing Mac news for us.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   We're going to stop being iOS only and we're going to pull on Apple.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   See, there must be Apple news.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   There must be Mac news.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   I heard somebody for it.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Good.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   We'll get Peter on too along with Renee.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Great.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.080]   We'll just try and try to soft pedal the idea that even Renee said, you know what?
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   I got nothing.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   Let's hire somebody.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   We did get a bunch of NAB.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Because anytime there's an NAB show, there's rumors about a new Mac Pro.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   So a bunch of people were trying to find anything they could to say that Apple's got the Mac.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.000]   We saw those rumors, but they didn't win.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.400]   Very credible, did they?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   No.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Like, oh, any day now, there's going to be.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   And not before WODC for certain and not before the end of the year for like.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.760]   But we did see, as I mentioned, some code in the next generation of OS 10 Mountain Lion
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.400]   that includes support for 802.11ac, which is the pending but new standard for Wi-Fi.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   I've used AC with an unusual device that allowed me to do it.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.000]   It was an early, it was maybe six months ago.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So it was very early on.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.840]   It was a router and then they gave you what they called a media extender that you could
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   use it for.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.000]   And it was faster, a little bit faster.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.200]   We ran a bunch of tests with Phil Nickinson from our Android Central sites because some
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.360]   of the new Android headsets, say they have AC support and he couldn't see a different
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   yet, a different set.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.880]   I don't know what the conditions are that would make for this difference.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.680]   But it does some other things that are very interesting, but that's going to require some
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.840]   advanced hardware.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.800]   For instance, if you get a router with this capability, it's part of the standard, it
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.080]   will tune and aim itself to you.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.440]   So for instance, here in the studio, we have very complex Wi-Fi setup because there's
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.800]   so much stuff going on and we have a very expensive multi-homed Wi-Fi router.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.840]   But what we could do is get an AC router and then if somebody, if I'm using it here, it
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.240]   will aim at me.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.800]   And then if Tom's using it over there, it'll aim at him.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.160]   And so eliminate some of the congestion and so forth.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.640]   That's a feature that's going to be available in some routers.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.840]   I doubt any of the routers currently do it.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.120]   It's a little antenna come out like machine guns on the actual TV shows.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.720]   The standards committee proposes, proposes, but only God disposes.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.080]   God, aka eddyq.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   It's funny.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   Every time there's a new rash of standards supporting routers out there, it really comes
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   out.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.760]   I'll get it in for testing and it's almost exactly like the dead parent sketch.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.680]   I was like, yeah, well, I set it up.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   I'm actually getting less bandwidth.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.480]   Oh, you're in New England.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.040]   I don't expect that in New England.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   It's the well-done.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.960]   I have to tell you, actually, I'm about 100 people for a sea level.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   Well, there you go then.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.160]   But I do have to say, given the fact that Apple charges are premium for its airport,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.520]   the airport extreme, it may well be that Apple will do a very nice high-end AC implementation
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.640]   on the airport extreme to go along with AC in Lyon and perhaps AC in new hardware.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   So that would be nice.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.560]   But the problem then would be, wouldn't they then have to include that in the mobile hardware
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   as well?
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.360]   And would they have the wherewithal to actually do that?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.080]   Or were they willing to be saying that our handsets don't get as fast speeds as your
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   laptops, which would be completely rational for any other company to say.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.520]   But you can see Apple making the case that, well, unless we don't want to create what
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.640]   is perceived as a degraded performance on the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.720]   Do you have an HTC One now?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.520]   I think I saw Renee, right?
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.080]   No, Phil has it.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   Phil has it.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080]   I'm getting mine, I think, in a week.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   I get mine tomorrow, I think.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.320]   I'm trying to remember, does that or the GS4 have AC?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.120]   I think some of the new handsets do.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.920]   Yeah, which one is several of these tests that...
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.440]   Pointless, because they're not maxing out the speed of the current 802.11n.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.000]   So anyway, it's just, you know, it's the industry.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.920]   You've got to have a reason to get new stuff.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.320]   And then the rumors about the iPad soon, right?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.480]   Next month?
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.320]   I heard originally that it was going to be as close as soon as this month, but it sounds
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   like everything is...
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   Wish that.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   I don't want to say delay because you can't delay a product that has not yet been announced
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   and it not even exists.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   You can only...
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Can you delay a rumor?
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.760]   Yeah, well, the thing is, like, sometimes there are internal markers for when things
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.200]   are thought to be in line.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   Like Apple is working towards a certain date, or at least that's what you hear, and then
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.520]   later things get pushed out.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.840]   For example, the story is about iOS 7 taking longer than anticipated.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   And, you know, maybe that's true.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.920]   Maybe that's false until Apple actually announces it and puts up a date.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.320]   It can't be delayed.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.600]   But it does look like we're not going to get the typical March/April iPad announcement
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.560]   that we've gotten every year to date.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.920]   Huh.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.480]   That won't kill me because they did just put out the fourth generation iPad in September,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   right, or October.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.400]   And they really needed to...
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.560]   The more developers you talk to, the more that chipset, the A5X sounded like it's a
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.440]   little bit more like they can make a great game on the iPad mini, a great game on the
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.400]   iPad 2, iPad 4 is fantastic, iPad 3 is just a world of hurt.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   Right.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   So putting that out fast was really important for developers and now, you know...
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.920]   Now they can rest in their laurels.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   The design talk.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.160]   Although I'm still hoping for...
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.680]   And I would buy right away an iPad mini with a retina display.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.360]   I don't know if that'll happen.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.880]   Nobody's saying that, right?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880]   It's prototyped.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.280]   As far as I know, it doesn't have battery life yet.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   It's prototype.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   That's the big thing.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.400]   The iPad and the iPad mini, they both have that super thin, super light design.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.480]   And you can have thin, you can have retina, and you can have battery life, but you can't
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   have all three yet.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.520]   So getting the battery life to 10 hours.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.800]   I'll take thick.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   Okay.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.440]   Does it have to be thin?
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   What is this thing?
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.840]   Everything has to be thinner and thinner and thinner.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   I agree.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.680]   It's strictly a design aesthetic.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.040]   And once that starts crowding out actual features, and that's when you got to step away
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.720]   from the abyss a little bit there.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.480]   But yeah, I've heard the exact same thing that Renee's heard that it really is a problem.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.520]   They can't solve the problem of battery just yet.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   That makes sense.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   And I guess...
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.280]   You don't want to have the inch thick iPad, really.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280]   You know, like...
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   Well, you know, for half inch thick then someone would say, "Why don't we give it a
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   card slot?"
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   You give it an ethernet port.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   BJA port.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   But what you do...
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   I mean, that is kind of a pain point though.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.000]   I mean, whenever I look at the other smaller compact tablets, that's the one airway.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.840]   I would definitely trade off the micro-thinnness of the iPad mini if I had the display of
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.360]   the Nexus 7.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.200]   Right now, the importance of the iPad's app infrastructure is enough that people really
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   don't care about it.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.360]   But I think that's going to become a more important point as the year goes by.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   And the thinness...
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.760]   I say thinness, but it really is for them.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   It's weight.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   It's our ability.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.000]   The iPad 4 was a great tablet, but for some people it was just too heavy and it had to
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   be used to hand.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.920]   And the whole point of the iPad mini wasn't to be thinner necessarily, but to be way lighter
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   so you could use it one-handed.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.600]   You could use it more easily in bed.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.480]   You could carry it around more easily.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.040]   And they don't want to give up the weight for the new one and they want to build a make
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.680]   the iPad 4 lighter as well so that it is more easy to carry around.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.520]   I wonder if somebody suggests in the chatroom, and this is a kind of interesting idea, and
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.160]   I think some laptop manufacturers are doing this, what about a cover that had extra battery?
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   Like you didn't have to have it, but you could buy it.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.800]   But then you'd have such poor specs on the battery, extra battery, less version that
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.960]   you couldn't sell it, right?
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.760]   And then how would you actually connect it right now?
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.400]   The only way to do that is the lightning connector, and the only way to do that would
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.280]   be to make it even larger tablet case, that would have to sort of chunk into.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   You do have an issue.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.880]   I mean, I'm thinking I'm looking at the iPhone 5, which is probably as thin as you
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.480]   want to get because at some point you can't put a camera in the thing, right?
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.120]   Yeah, it was hard to put a camera in that one.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.960]   Yeah, I mean, in some manufacturers put a bulge there, but that's not, that's unsightly.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.480]   I don't know who cares.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.360]   I mean, there, no, I'm serious.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.840]   I think there are things that really give you the oo and off factor when you take the thing
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   out of the box, but then you absolutely forget about it like a week later.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.240]   Yeah, when you put it in a mophie case and it's half an inch thick.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.480]   And I've said it before.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   I mean, who I don't know many people who carry their iPhones naked.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   There you go.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.040]   He's got a nice big spec case on it.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.200]   And yeah, I love this.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   This is the spec candy grip.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.520]   I think candy bar grip, I think, something like that.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.800]   But yeah, I mean, as, I mean, as it is, I mean, there's, there's style and there's
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   then this practicality.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.600]   And one of the reasons why I put this on a case and why I put, I have this case specifically
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.360]   is that that damn glass back on the iPhone 4s, it was always sliding off of things and
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.880]   falling onto the floor until I gave it something with a little bit of grip on it.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   So yeah.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.320]   And I said it before, I really wish that that Apple would create a slightly thicker iPhone
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.520]   but said, but after say, after during the keynote saying here is why it's two millimeter
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.720]   thicker, but here's everything we're able to add to it because of those two millimeters.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.760]   We think it's the best two millimeters we've ever added to it.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   iPhone max.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.800]   Well, you know, as Louis Mante, I had a really good way of saying it.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.640]   There's a design that you want to buy and the design that you want to live with.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   And often companies focus on the one they would think that you want to buy, but not
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.640]   necessarily the one you want to live with.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.720]   And this is a good example.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.000]   People like thinner things in a showroom and when they press the shopping cart button,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.840]   but being able to use a device every day and not have it run out on you or have it take
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.720]   better pictures are things that make owning that thing for a year or two years so much
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   better.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.560]   You don't want to wind up with the technology equivalent of a flank Frank Lloyd right house
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.720]   where it looks great.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   The pictures are wonderful.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.220]   You'll sell a million postcards, but the damn thing starts falling apart after eight years
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.800]   and you really wish that the bathroom was not eight rooms away from the master bedroom.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   Does that happen?
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.320]   I mean, I always wanted a Frank Lloyd right house.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.600]   You think there's there's buyers remorse if you have one of them?
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.320]   Well, there if you're in falling water, you go, yeah, it's great except the roof leaks.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   Well, you're falling water.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.640]   And he did kind of screw up the math and they have and they are in a position where they
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.720]   have to I think right now they're even rather in a position where there's a sort of taking
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   it apart so they can build it so it will not fall apart.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.120]   No, that's depressing.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   And also he's he's he's he was also the sort of architect who would tell you that.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.760]   Oh, well, I thank you for thank you for letting me visit your home, but you're not allowed
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.480]   to put that lamp on that table.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   Right.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.120]   I'm here's a here's a brand new lamp I've designed for you and a bill for $7,000 for having designed
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   this lamp for you.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.520]   You made the furniture to go in these houses so that you you would beautiful places.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.440]   I've been to like in the Chicago area there are a couple of what I forget the name of it,
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.200]   but he was doing a sort of a line of homes that was sort of like made kind of affordable
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.160]   where it wouldn't necessarily wasn't bespoke to the to the actual location.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.800]   And so gorgeous gorgeous house, but you're also aware of I don't I want to take off my
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.240]   shoes before I go in this place and I don't want to eat any food in the kitchen because
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.080]   I don't want to drop any crumbs and it's a very odd looking out inside and out.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   Yeah, it's good because you know what I I don't want it to be nice because I'm jealous
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   and I don't I have what is that word?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   It's not shot in front.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.960]   We have the new word anyway to forget it also.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.440]   Hey, Lightroom five in beta.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.720]   You can download it now.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.080]   A lot of people in the chat room talking like room for been out for a couple of years.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:39.960]   This is the kind of the competitor to aperture from Adobe that a lot of photographers myself
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.480]   included use and love and there's some nice new features in this and you can get it for
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.400]   free even if you don't own Lightroom right now.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.960]   It's a public beta.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.720]   So Adobe Labs recommended if you are a photographer and you want to try the other guy.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.800]   You know, if you're using aperture, I know you're an aperture user Andy, right?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.880]   Yeah, I use it.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.640]   I've had they had access to it about a week ago.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.680]   Oh, five has only got to five.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.720]   It has a lot of really cool features like their times went like a lot of magically fix
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.200]   the perspective and fix the angle of any picture so that if you've taken like a shot
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.240]   of shot like this where it's very, very geometric, but it's just a little bit off like a little
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.520]   bit off off angle.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.360]   It will figure out like where the look for horizon line will look for horizontal where
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.280]   it thinks are horizontal lines and will actually fix it for you automatically.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   And you thought you eyeballed it and you thought it was perfect, but now it's actually
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   perfect.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.680]   It will also do things like that's pretty amazing that it can do that.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.880]   Yeah, no, it's so many other things too.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   I mean, there are times when I'll take a picture of like an iPad and iPad mini just for the
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.800]   column and I can't shoot it dead on because then I'll get a reflection of myself in the
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   screen.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.640]   So it's maybe a little bit off that same feature will figure out that, okay, this is sort of
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.080]   the perspective is it's keystone a little bit because of off angle.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   If this if the user has told me to do this, I'm going to fix it so that all the angles
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   are straight.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   So even if you're taking it like an architectural picture of your house, all of a sudden it's
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.200]   like you had a tilt shift lens attached to it.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.760]   Now all the verticals are vertical, all the horizontals are horizontal and it's even
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   smart enough to know that, oh, well, there's a dude standing in front of the right should
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.200]   probably not warp that dude's face quite so much.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.080]   There's just a lot of really cool little things like that.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:29.440]   And the other thing I love is that you it has a really cool advanced smart preview feature
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   where when you import stuff off if you copy things onto your onto an external hard drive,
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.720]   but your Lightroom library is on your as on your notebook or even on your Mac book air,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.400]   it will create it will leave the originals where they are on the hard drive, but create
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.960]   really high definition previews that you can actively work with.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.120]   And it doesn't it doesn't really care that the hard drive is unattached either so that
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.160]   you can then go out for two or three days and shoot more pictures and make adjustments
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.720]   to all that stuff that's back on the hard drive back home.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.760]   And as soon as you plug it back in again, it figures out that, oh, well, I remember,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.880]   I remember, I know that this guy applied this tone effect, this this gradient effect,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.480]   and it will all just sort of sync up automatically.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   So really cool stuff.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.240]   It's going to be interesting to see what happens because traditionally Adobe charges.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   I can't remember.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.080]   I think 25 bucks for the upgrade from previous versions, but since four came out, they've
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.800]   started selling it on the app store for 150 bucks.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.600]   And I'm just curious if what are they going to do?
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.800]   Are they going to have because is there is there a process for having up there isn't?
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.040]   No, that was my question immediately too, because I'm a longtime aperture.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.280]   Well, I use aperture for as long as it takes to right click and edit in Photoshop, but
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.800]   I've tried Lightroom as well.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.160]   You're not really a user.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.560]   It's just a sort of a station on the way to a library is an aperture.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   The editor is in Photoshop.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.800]   But I use Lightroom a little bit and I bought it in the Mac App Store and the Mac App Store
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   has no ability to do upgrades.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.720]   That's why Mountain Line was 20 bucks.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   So is this going to be a new version of the dollar products?
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.880]   Yeah, it's the first big app I can think of that's going to have an update in the Mac
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   App Store.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   It's going to be challenging.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.440]   I did ask and pricing and availability is unannounced at this time.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   Well, it's in Australia.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440]   It's my question.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.800]   So those of us who bought it in the more traditional way will probably have an upgrade
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   path through Adobe.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.000]   But I don't know what's going to happen if you bought it in the App Store.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.880]   And if you're thinking buying Lightroom for in the App Store, I don't know, should you?
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   What should you do?
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.320]   Should you jump on it and say, great, I'm going to get a free upgrade?
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.440]   Or should you go maybe I shouldn't because the upgrade will be more expensive this way.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   I don't know.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   They could make it free.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.640]   They could just update the app in the app store.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.640]   That's what aperture does, right?
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.000]   I mean, aperture, they're no longer going to charge for upgrades.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   They can't.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   As far as we can tell, I mean, when there's a-- I work has never been updated.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.440]   Aperture hasn't really been updated.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.400]   Final Cut Pro 10 came out, but no significant update has come out.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.120]   And the only time they've done a big update has been an operating system.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.680]   And those are subsidized by hardware anyway, so they don't care how much they charge for
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   them.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680]   So this will be interesting.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   If you buy it now, the best thing that can happen is you get a free update.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.520]   The worst thing that can happen is you have to buy the next version for the same price.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   Ooh, that would be bad.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.760]   So it always moves you to wait and see.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   That would be twice as much.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.040]   They're charging 150 on the app store, and people are saying, no, it's $79.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.680]   The upgrade, typically, not $25.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.240]   So by the way, they do point upgrades for free on the app store, because they're up to
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.200]   4.4 on the app store as they are on the normal download process.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   That's an interesting question.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.920]   For now, it's free, and there's no limitations.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.800]   It expires in a few months.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.520]   But I mean, it's the fully functional thing you can save.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   You can export.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   It's great.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.720]   I wonder, do you think that's why Apple has not--
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.960]   updated iWork and aperture?
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   No.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   No.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   I think they have other problems with it.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.560]   It's because iWork at this point does not help them to sell any hardware.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.160]   And also, they feel as though people's needs are being quite well served by products as
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   they exist.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.480]   No one has a brilliant master plan for iWork.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.000]   It had to be updated to make sure that it's supported iCloud because iCloud is a feature
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.760]   that everything needs to support.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.240]   But it's really in limbo right now.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:15.840]   I've been trying to-- I don't have the same sort of sources inside Apple on user software.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.760]   But I've been trying to find out if there's any real activity in iWork right now because
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.280]   it is a little bit--
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   It's old.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.280]   It's weird.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   I mean, it's super-annuated.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   They've not been updated for years.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.800]   Are there more than zero engineers to find?
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   I mean, I think the desktop version hasn't received a major update since 2009, I think,
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   2010s.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   No, I think you're right.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   I think you're right.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   You know it.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.920]   That's kind of bizarre given that how much weight they put behind it initially and really
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.640]   how important it is to have really good professional level software that syncs across all of your
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.800]   Apple devices.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.560]   So quite a surprise.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.960]   But it's not just iWork because Aputure really is overdue for an update.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.000]   Logic is overdue for an update.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.120]   And these are all apps that people are buying in the App Store.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   I just--
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.120]   The whole Pro Tools.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.120]   The whole Pro Tools.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:09.560]   We are hiring one Pro Tools, but we haven't seen much yet.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:16.360]   Pages-- I'm looking at my pages, which is Pages 09, which is why you don't name things
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   for years.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.960]   Because now that's four years ago.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.200]   But the copyright goes through 2012, but that's because they've been pushing updates.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   But like fractional updates.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   They haven't done a real-- hey, here's our new version of this other side.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.800]   But bug fixes primarily.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.440]   It's gotten zero keynote time since Phil Schiller.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   Wow.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   Mm-mm.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   We're talking with Renee Richie.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   I'm more.com.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.560]   What?
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   But--
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.760]   No, no, I was just going to say something snarky that maybe they just got it so perfectly
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.880]   that they said, you know, there's a point at which Leonardo put his brush down and said,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.200]   you know what, this is Dean Chapel.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.920]   I painted the Holy crap out of this.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.480]   I will only ruin it if I amend it any further.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.120]   Well, to be fair, I give Microsoft a hard time every time they put it out of their
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.200]   office like, what are you going to add, you know, that you don't already have?
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.360]   It's another 20 features nobody uses.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.640]   I work is pretty perfect.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.280]   Is there anything that is desperately overdue for an update?
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.600]   Well, they did add some collaborative features on the desktop end.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   So I should correct myself.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.320]   It's not if I haven't added any major features to it.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   But the--
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   I work on beta, right?
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.960]   That was the game changer.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   I worked.com.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960]   Oh, boy.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.120]   And then I have to take a couple, take another four years on the Apple Watch, take five
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   years on the TV.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120]   Oh, boy.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.920]   So long as you get-- this has changed my life in a highly positive way.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.600]   My outlook is now much like Mary Tyler Moore at the end of her opening credit sequence.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.120]   If I had a floppy cap, I would be throwing it into the air.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.520]   Thank goodness for I worked on it.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.640]   In our chatroom, the undecided gives a lie to his name saying, pages is crap.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.080]   He has decided apparently about one thing anyway.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.240]   It's interesting because Word is an interesting program because I use InDesign or I use BB
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   Edit.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   I never use Word.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.040]   And my sister loves pages because it lets her easily mock up stuff.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.400]   Like, Word, you put a picture on and suddenly it's in a different place and text is wrapping.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.320]   And it's not really a page layout program.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   Yeah, but no.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.640]   In fact, somebody's saying no 300 DPI, no CYMK.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.680]   There are pro layout features.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   It lacks.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.880]   But that's what Apple doesn't really intend it for that.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.800]   What people need to understand is that Microsoft Office is infrastructure.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   It's not about being able to drop a picture in and create a family newsletter in three
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   clicks.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.440]   It's about having 40 people working on one document that then has to be shuffled into
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.320]   a project being done by 80 people on the other side of the coast and another division of
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.640]   the company and having that all work together in a positive way.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.160]   And it's also about being able to hire somebody and not have to spend two weeks training them
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.320]   up on software they're not familiar with.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:57.040]   So offices, sometimes compared to the heating ventilation and cooling system of an office,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.600]   nobody will identify themselves as a user of this, but everybody uses it.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   Yeah, it is infrastructure.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.480]   I think that's exactly the way to put it.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.280]   So it's not the sexy features that Apple would need to add.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.920]   It's that, look, we can run your entire business based on these three apps.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.120]   They work together so well that you would not want to have that's okay to train new
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.360]   people in order to switch from office to a tie work.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   And as numerous people are pointing out in the chatroom, Excel is if you're going to
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.400]   do serious spreadsheet and you don't use numbers, it's not.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.920]   And so there is a long way to go with numbers to make it anywhere near Excel.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.800]   My sense is Apple's given that one up.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   There's nothing else.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.760]   Well, I think they mean it for a home environmentally.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.880]   Yeah, it's for planning menus.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.920]   Yeah, for running your business.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.800]   It's like Stalker leagues or putting your budget.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.520]   But what's kind of annoys me is that, and this might get into, this might get into something
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.840]   we can talk about after the commercial.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.640]   But it's like Apple has not done anything to allow developers to create that kind of
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   power.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   They killed the market.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.840]   Well, they then moved on just like Google did with reader.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:04.760]   It's like, well, A, they killed it and B, they've not given iOS developers the tools
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.520]   to do really good rich text formatting.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.400]   You really, if it was true, something, if you, yeah, they keep promising that they'll,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.640]   there's a reason why there's really only one or two apps that allow you to do something
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.080]   as incredible as actually a talicized text and see that text is italicized.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.240]   It's not built into the text edit routines.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.400]   It's not built into it.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.640]   They were promising that for a long, long time.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.080]   They finally went out, I think last year as an API, but it turned out to be more like
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   we're going to give you a different version of HTML view, which then you can sort of
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.280]   try to work out how to work out.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   And so right now developers are in the stage where we can either write our entire, an entire
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.720]   text rendering engine on our own for this specific product or, and then compete with
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:54.000]   the $15 app that Apple is putting in every commercial or we can simply, you know, stick
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.240]   to a markdown editor and say, get, congratulations.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   Welcome to 1983.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.960]   You can italicize by surrounding the world with tokens and then sort of imagine in your
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.440]   head that this word is italicized.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.640]   And it gets harder too, because if you use Apple's built-in cortex to get all the accessibility
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.440]   stuff for free and if you do your own, you have to rebuild not just the text rendering,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   but all the accessibility.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:19.200]   Well, this might explain why Mary Jo Foley had this pretty big scoop on Windows Weekly
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.000]   this week.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.520]   iPad versions of offices may be delayed till next year.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:32.520]   We're talking, her sources of Microsoft said it's a year off for iPad versions of office.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.600]   Yeah, I've always wondered exactly what the effect is going to be once.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:42.280]   Microsoft manages to deploy a mobile version of office that's really, really good, not
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.920]   just a cut down version, but a really, really good version.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.000]   Because part of one possible answer in my head is that this will be seen as a really
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.200]   great equalizer, that if Android tablets next year are good enough, they're still not nearly
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.560]   as good as the iPad, but they're kind of good enough.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.320]   And now someone is facing that buying decision and they see that, well, I can get really
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.720]   what I need for this for is the web email and Microsoft Office and this Microsoft Office,
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.680]   the exact same app on each one of these tablets, whether it's iOS, Android or Windows RT,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.760]   and I think I'm going to go with this Acer tablet or this Google tablet because the camera's
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:24.160]   better or because it's a larger higher capacity battery or something as prosaic as we were
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.280]   talking about having a clip on battery extender.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:33.160]   One of the things I really love about Asus' Transformers is that it is a really great
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:40.400]   looking, standard, flat, small, 10-inch multitouch tablet, but then you click it into this absolutely
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.800]   rock solid keyboard dock and it turns into a hinged notebook.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.040]   And because that the keyboard part has not only a trackpad, not only a really great keyboard,
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.600]   but also a duplicate of the same battery that's inside the tablet, now you have an 18-hour
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   notebook.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.640]   And man, if Apple made a flavor of the iPad like that, I would, I don't care if I just
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.800]   bought my previous iPad a month ago, I would be going out and getting that one.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:09.720]   So that's why I'm really curious to see what kind of effect that Microsoft Office, pound
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.000]   for pound, equal on every platform would have on the entire market.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.240]   That's interesting too because Microsoft is very different from other companies.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.960]   They made active sync available to everybody.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.680]   It was supposed to be an advantage for Windows Mobile and that was going to make Windows
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.200]   Mobile be blackberry in the enterprise and then suddenly Google licensed it and Apple
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.240]   licensed it.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.720]   And then in Office, some people thought that the delay was because they wanted to give
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.560]   it to Windows Phone or Surface first because that would give an advantage to enterprise.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.000]   Yeah, from a marketing point of view, the answer to what Andy just said is, well, you
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   just get Surface RT.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.880]   Now you got full Office free and a tablet.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.680]   What more could you want?
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.880]   Well, like apps would actually work with multi-tobble.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.280]   Oh, no, come on, now stop it.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.400]   And also, we should be really careful here that one of the reasons why RT is kind of a
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.480]   weirdo tablet is that when you get Office for RT, it really is Microsoft Windows running
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   Microsoft Windows Office.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   Yeah, it doesn't really work that great.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   No.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   The tablet form factor.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   It's a little strange.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.040]   Well, and again, I mentioned the word shod and Freud.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.480]   There has to be just a little bit on the Mac side when you see Mary Jo Foley scoop this
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.840]   week that the next version of Windows Windows Blue may give you a switch that turns off
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.000]   the Metro interface and brings back the start button, which would be a huge capitulation.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.320]   I don't think they're going to do it, but it would be a huge capitulation for Microsoft
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.680]   saying, yeah, we made a big mistake and I just can't see them doing that.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.080]   Me neither, but this is a Windows show.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.240]   No, no, we'll save that for Thursday.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.280]   But you know, classic mode, like classic mode.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   Oh, man.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.000]   Well, that is, I'll just say that this is something that Microsoft does really, really
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.360]   well, where they don't feel as though their entire ego is on the ground is on the table
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.600]   every time they release something.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   But they do this time.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.120]   Well, no, I mean, they're willing to say here is a develop.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.200]   Here is a beta preview of the operating system, which you can use for an entire year for free.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   Right.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.040]   And what we actually ship might be completely different from that because we're going to
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.920]   listen to what people have to say.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.520]   And then after we ship Windows 8, we have no problem in modifying that further to listen
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.400]   to what people are saying and make changes.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.640]   Even better if they had micro, Apple tends to get it right with their first shot out
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.800]   of the box.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.880]   But on the other hand, it's not necessarily a bad thing that Microsoft can say, we're
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.880]   not going to tell you that we are the light and the shadow.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   We are everything that you want to know, every system to be.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.840]   We are willing to fix things when people say we've listened to your idea.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.920]   We tried your idea.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.120]   We think your idea sucks rocks.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.400]   Come back.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.920]   Andy Enoco is here from the Chicago Sun times, mincing no words, which I like.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.520]   And Renee Richie from imore.com.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.960]   He's mincing garlic and making a fine poutine.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.440]   But that's another story.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.600]   You don't put garlic and poutine.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.680]   That would spoil it.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.200]   You can make Italian because you're from Canada, Renee.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.640]   Get it?
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   Is that racist?
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   Come on now.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   Anti-Canadian.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.560]   I love my Canadians.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.560]   We're going to take a break.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.920]   Come back with more with Renee and Andy and more Apple talk.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.600]   For those of you who are saying, why are they talking about Windows?
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   What did that happen?
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.360]   We will promise more Apple talk.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.080]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at squarespace.com who make simply put the
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:27.840]   best hosting system with the best content management software anywhere.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   I'm a fan.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   I know you will be too.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.000]   If it's time for you to create a website, if you're a photographer, an artist and you
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.480]   want a portfolio, look, you're in a business where your aesthetics matter, you're going
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.800]   to need to go somewhere where you can make a great site.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.920]   But it's not, you know, web design may not be your business.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.160]   Wouldn't it be nice to somehow be able to make a great looking personal site that's unique
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.400]   to you, that expresses your aesthetic and not be a master web designer?
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.480]   This is what squarespace does.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.960]   The best hosting with the best software, templates that you start with that are gorgeous, including
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.640]   many portfolio based templates.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.400]   And then you can customize them so that your site looks like nobody else.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.600]   So it fits your aesthetic, it fits your design.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.760]   And I got to say, squarespace has other features that you're going to really like dive into
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   it.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   Give yourself two weeks to play with squarespace.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.880]   You've got a free trial that you don't even need to give them a credit card or any personal
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.120]   information except an email address in case you lose the password.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:28.960]   You can try these amazing templates, start designing a site, customizing, you don't need
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.920]   to know any HTML, JavaScript, CSS.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.600]   Of course, if you do, they have a developer platform with a syntax code coloring and
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.960]   all that stuff.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.280]   So you have the chance to do both.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.560]   But you can completely with drag, point and click make a unique, beautiful professional
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.760]   website.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.400]   And then, and this is the thing that just every time I see this blows me away, if you say,
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.000]   hey, you know, after a couple of weeks, you've imported your content.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.600]   By the way, it does have an importer from all the blog APIs.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.920]   It'll take your content, take your images, all the SEO, all the links, everything's preserved,
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.160]   even the comments are preserved.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.680]   So you can, when you're trying this, I mean, you're trying it with real data and lots of
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   it.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.520]   If after all of that, you say, hey, boy, you know, this is better than what I got or this
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   is a great site.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   I want to try.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.080]   This is what blows me away the pricing.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.680]   These are prices for annual plans, $8 a month for the standard plan, $16 for the unlimited
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.160]   plan.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.840]   And then if you want to add e-commerce, this is a new feature, $24 a month when you buy
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.520]   an annual plan, that's it.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.920]   It's very simple.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.840]   They also have month to month, just a few bucks more every month if you decide, you
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.840]   know, I just want to try it for a few months.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.520]   But listen to what you get for the unlimited plan.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.880]   This is $16 a month.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.920]   Unlimited galleries, you can have password protected galleries for each client and have
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.960]   as many as you want.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.720]   Unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, suddenly lots of people are going to your site, don't
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.120]   worry, you're not going to get a bill for bandwidth.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.960]   And by the way, you cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.480]   I don't know how many people suddenly decide to visit you.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.280]   Unlimited storage, you don't have to worry about the sizes of your images, unlimited
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   contributors.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   You could have multiple people working on the same page.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   You get automatically with their designs, a mobile website because it's mobile responsive
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   design.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   So it doesn't matter what size screen.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:13.080]   And then if you decide to want to add e-commerce, they have the most affordable, the best e-commerce
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.800]   system out there.

[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.720]   This is what you come up with.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.920]   No surprise, people love Squarespace.

[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.280]   Amazing company.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.560]   We are in good company right now.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.640]   Renee Richie from iMore Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.440]   Renee was playing with chat heads.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.640]   I was trying to.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   They haven't shown up for me yet.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   You don't have it yet.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.640]   Okay.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.280]   I'm going to Facebook on iOS app on iPad and phone.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   Facebook 6.0.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.320]   See, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.400]   I'm looking in my store.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   I got it just before the show.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.600]   Well, I think that's the stage these rollouts, right?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.200]   It's a content distribution network and it kind of rolls out slowly across.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.520]   Let me refresh and see.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.760]   So what's new in Facebook 6?
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.240]   It's a design tweak.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.720]   So they kind of made it.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.200]   I don't know the right word to put it.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.480]   They made it a little bit cleaner looking and the big parts are the chat heads which
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   are rolling out slowly.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.880]   This was the thing we thought we'd never get because it's part of Facebook home.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.760]   Well, they can't take over the lock screen or the home screening the way they do on certain
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.960]   versions of Android, but they can with what the chat has let you do is chat from anywhere
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.520]   within the Facebook app.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   And it's a really big, expansive app.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.360]   You hit that hamburger button and you have all sorts of pages and friend sheets and things
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   you can do.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.800]   Well, you can keep chatting while you're doing all the different Facebook stuff.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.960]   Chat heads is a really, really great idea because when I was playing with Facebook home last
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:46.160]   week, I didn't realize that it really is exactly it is really exactly the correct way
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.760]   to do chat because it's not something that when someone texts you, you don't want to
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.600]   have to leave the app you're in to go back to a text app or do a chat app to reply then
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.160]   go back to what you're doing before.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.560]   The idea that you always, if there's an active conversation going on with somebody, there's
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.400]   always that person's little avatar and a little circle up there.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.160]   You can move the circle around wherever you want.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   And then you can always just tap into that and add to the conversation and respond to
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.080]   something and responses are always overlaid over whatever you're doing right there.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   Really great idea.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.040]   I hope it influences other apps and other operating systems.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.200]   Have you played with Facebook home on Android, Andy?
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.120]   My review of it is coming up in a couple of days on the Sun Time site.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.600]   And I really love, I really love the thinking here.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.480]   I don't like Facebook.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:35.880]   And to be honest, it's like I got out a loaner phone, wiped it of all personal information,
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.320]   restored it and it only knows it turned off GPS.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.840]   It has none of my contacts, none of my calendars.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.120]   It is never seen like a SIM card that has my phone number on it.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.880]   So I know that the face, yeah, exactly.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.000]   It's a burner phone in every way.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.120]   So it's like something out of the wire for sure.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.160]   Because the thing that worries me is that I know that the whole point here is to capture
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.080]   more of my experience and monetize it and categorize it.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.520]   But that said, this idea of you turn on your phone and you don't see a grid of icons, you
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.640]   see people that you're interacting with immediately that you can interact, you can have ongoing
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.040]   chats not only on the Android platform, not just inside the Facebook app, but these
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   chat heads appear everywhere that if you've chosen to keep this thing active, then even
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.600]   when you're in the web browser, even when you're in your to-do list manager and any third
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.960]   party Android app, it's just still there.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:36.520]   So many just great, great ideas that really, it really made me, as I was sketching out
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:44.600]   this review, it just made me realize that iOS is the only pre-Obama mobile operating system
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   we have.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   It's the only one that is--
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   >> That's interesting.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.920]   >> It's a product of the George W. Bush administration.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.040]   And it has nothing in it that says hope and change about it.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   It's still wonderful.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   I love it.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.880]   I still think it's fantastic.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   All I'm saying is that when Facebook, Facebook for God's sake does something that's this
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.840]   new and this lovely.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.560]   It's not perfect, but in terms of basic ideas, it has a lot of great ideas there.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.240]   It's like, I'm ready to just take down the mission accomplished banner, Apple.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.440]   Please address some of the fundamental problems affecting my wonderful Apple nation already.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   >> What do you think people--
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:28.360]   >> Apple do with iOS something like-- I can't remember who was it, all things D this week.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.160]   And said, "Apples should we get better at partnerships?"
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.600]   Facebook and Twitter worked great.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.280]   They need to do more integration into iOS that should get better at partnerships.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.960]   Should Apple be doing something like this?
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.600]   I mean, message is close, but it's iOS only.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.120]   And one of the advantages Facebook chat has is it's cross-platform.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.520]   >> It's single network cross-platform.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   So it's the same thing--
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.200]   >> Facebook, it's like AM or Google talk or whatever.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.480]   >> It's not a multi-pipe client.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.960]   You can't use your Google talk.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.280]   >> No, in fact, Google's probably going to do that with Babel soon.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.800]   And if Google does that with Babel and puts it on AM, I think Google should be looking
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   at Facebook home and say, "Whoops, we ought to have done that."
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.040]   >> It will be a Google+ phone so fast, Leo.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   >> There's got to be.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.240]   And I would imagine that Apple or not, is Apple looking at something like this?
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:18.320]   It sounds like, according to these rumors that you referred to earlier, that they're already
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.240]   overwhelmed with iOS.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   What is it?
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   Six, the next one?
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.240]   Four?
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.000]   >> So the way iOS works though is it's like a continuum.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.880]   So there's a bunch of features that they want to do in iOS.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.040]   And however many are finished and ready to go by the time a release cycle is up, those
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.960]   go in and the ones that aren't finished yet, they just move on to the next release cycle.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.520]   >> It feels like Apple's doing everything Facebook's doing, but only for Apple platforms, FaceTime
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.840]   and Messages primarily.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:50.120]   >> Well, not really, what we're talking about here is that Apple has to take a couple of,
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:54.160]   for Apple to get into the Obama era, it seems as though they really have to take a couple
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.280]   steps back from iOS as it exists right now and change from the fundamental philosophies
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   that inform its features.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.480]   That the things that you can do inside Facebook home are things that, not just against Apple's
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.960]   style, it is just not possible to have applications overlaid onto other applications that way.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.680]   This very center of the experience can never be anything other than Springboard.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.760]   It's just a point after point after point, it's not the sort of thing where they could
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:28.040]   just take out module A and replace it with module A dot BIS and change the whole character
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.120]   of the device.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.080]   So I don't think that, so I'm not saying it's an impossible task.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.440]   I'm saying that this is not the sort of thing that's going to happen from just some people
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.760]   wanting to facelift the interface and take off away from the visual clutter.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.400]   They have to decide that we are not a city in which people commute in by car.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   We are a city in which people come in electronically or come in by a public transit.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.040]   You've got to do basically Google did project butter because they realized that interface
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.000]   was a problem and they had to have a concerted effort to fix it.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.320]   And Facebook is doing home because they realized that they had to do something to establish
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   their presence on mobile before they become irrelevant.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.480]   Apple needs some sort of movement and Springboard is not modular yet.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   But Apple is far, let me defend them and we're going to fix your audio while I'm defending
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.480]   them.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   Apple is far from irrelevant.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.200]   I mean, iOS is still dominant, isn't it?
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.400]   No, I'm sorry, go ahead, Renee.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.840]   No, I was just going to say that Apple could do this by, for example, there's something
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:30.200]   called bite SMS in jailbreak, which lets you answer iMessages anywhere from anywhere
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   in the system.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.400]   And Apple could take notification center and just make a way for developers to surface
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.600]   reply buttons or reset counters or any number of useful things the way WebOS used to do
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.360]   in their notifications.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.600]   And then you have Apple gets their security, they get their abstracted operating system
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.480]   and developers get to use this functionality.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.320]   So there are all sorts of things that I'd love to see them do.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.120]   I just don't know when in the development cycle, those things are coming.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   They're not going to be able to do it anytime in the near future, right?
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.240]   I don't see that in 2013.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.880]   No, yeah.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.080]   Or even 2014.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.960]   Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, I mean, they're working towards it.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.280]   They're doing a bunch of things that would, like they set up the, all the infrastructure
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.160]   for headless apps, which is apps that don't require a live interface while you're using
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   them.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.360]   So you're starting to see this in the development code?
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.080]   Yeah, well, in iOS six, they put a bunch of stuff in for that.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   All right.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   So they're paying attention.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.560]   Yeah, I mean, I think they know where they have to go.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   It's just a question.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.560]   No company has limitless resources.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.080]   And you know, last year they devoted everything to getting maps, getting past book, getting
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.280]   out, outsourcing social to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.920]   And that was all the time and engineering resources they had.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.960]   So this year we're going to see what their priorities are.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.640]   I just got a remember that Facebook and some of it updated now.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.960]   And remember that a couple of Mac OS releases ago was referred to as the cleaning out the
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.120]   desk drawer's release where they put a priority on every single little thing that we have
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.920]   deferred because of larger things.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.840]   We've decided that we're going to focus on basically getting as many things off the
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.520]   bottom of the to-do list as possible.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.760]   I mean, it's we when you when you think of Apple as a company that makes eight point
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.200]   one, a trillion dollars per month and is building a six billion dollar space space ship
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.680]   complex, you think of them as a company that is slightly magical.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   We can do anything.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:19.200]   But just like Renee says, they have limited resources, limited time, limited budget.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.880]   And it's shocking to people that in order to get a new version of the mobile OS off the
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.200]   door, they have to pull people off of other projects that happen.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   That is shocking.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:35.080]   We we it's it also realized that they they have a lot fewer lesser motivations to create
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.760]   the sort of revolution than companies like Microsoft and Facebook and Blackberry do because
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.120]   you know, they're those people, they're just absolutely in the dumper.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.480]   Microsoft had to sort of say, okay, we're going to throw away our entire mobile operating
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   system.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.640]   We're going to pretend it doesn't exist anymore because because our users are one step ahead
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.160]   of us on that.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   And now we're going to have to create something brand new.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.400]   It's easy to leap from a burning building.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.960]   It's difficult when you're in a place of absolute comfort and safety and success and you want
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.320]   to go into someplace that's uncertain.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   Great.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:11.680]   Great in our chat rooms has the next version of iOS 10, by the way, it's always 10 grumpy
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   cat.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:18.120]   Oh, it's 10 F dot you.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:23.280]   Sorry, Renee, I interrupted you.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.640]   No, I was just going to say the one thing I hope about Facebook home is that this approach
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.880]   has been tried before Microsoft tried with the kin.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.200]   They tried again with Windows phones.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.360]   Yeah, the can lasted three months.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.680]   Michael Gartenberg had a great idea.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.600]   He had his he had his daughter review at Miller had his daughter review because they thought
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.280]   that maybe, you know, we don't get Facebook.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.280]   We don't get people.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   We don't get all these different services.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.160]   Maybe our kids will and those they didn't find an attraction in the market.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.080]   So I hope if nothing else, Facebook shows that you don't have to be absentric and that
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.440]   I don't think Facebook is the answer.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.200]   I think it's just as extreme as the as the springboard because it's a wall.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.560]   Garden it's so but if somebody that's why maybe have hopes for Google because Google
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.720]   maybe could do a non not a walled garden.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.920]   I mean, it's they don't need to.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   They just want you.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.200]   I was trying to do patent searches to see how much of this that Facebook had actually
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:11.080]   locked down the IP for I was I wasn't unable to find documentation that other companies
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.440]   wouldn't be free to sort of just copy a lot of these ideas wholesale.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.480]   So I don't think that this is going to cause people to stand P to turn their phones into
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.920]   Facebook phones, but I do hope that Google is going to take a look at some of these ideas
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.280]   and Apple's going to take a look at some of the ideas and everybody else is going to
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.840]   take a look at these ideas and say that's a really good idea.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.600]   If someone if someone on Android decided to create a chat app that you know, there's
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:38.880]   a lot of apps for iOS and and Android that combine SMS and and Google's chat and all
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   the other chat platforms.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.720]   If someone was able to do a chat platform, there's implemented a version of of of chat
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.720]   heads.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   Boy, that's four ninety nine.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.480]   That's an even nine ninety nine that I easily spend and I'm sure that there are people
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.360]   who are now working on that.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.760]   One night just to make this all Mac related so we don't get in trouble.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.520]   Leo said it was all designed in courts composer.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.320]   So we yeah, was it it was yes.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.720]   Awesome.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.240]   But then they ported its Android.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   What the hell?
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.680]   So those those those results of the influence of Mr. Matass who got hired away from used
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.720]   to be an Apple and hired away a few years ago.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.920]   And I saw that Lauren Brikter is also working for Facebook on home.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   Wow.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:23.480]   So Apple has sent a lot of spores out there in that there there Google Microsoft and Facebook.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.600]   Their former Apple employees that took a lot of their basic idea or lease that the ideas
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.920]   that allowed them to create successful products at Apple decided sort of, you know, I'm going
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.000]   to now work at Google and I'm going to say no to things that are very, very Google and
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.440]   try to encourage people to do things that are a little bit more would be more compatible
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.760]   with an Apple device.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.000]   So yeah, I mean, of course, composer, there are so many people who are using it to prototype
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   everything.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.600]   Because it's a way to simply say here is exactly it's a way to take a take a talk to developers
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.360]   who are very, very digitally, you know, Spock minded and say, no, this specifically is how
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.640]   I want this to look.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   And this is how these elements of this application should interact with each other.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.280]   And there's nothing like a working live breathing example to show to somebody to demonstrate
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.720]   here is the basic concept we want to make sure it's consistent from experience to experience
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   to experience.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.200]   I'll put this in the chat room.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.800]   Brad Ellis from Pacific helm did a talk at Singleton last year using courts composer
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.160]   instead of keynote.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.400]   And it's one of the most impressive things that you have to know you'd have to you'd
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.840]   have to be pretty good to do this, right?
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.600]   I mean, you this is I know it's just drag and drop.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.240]   There's no code.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.520]   You can use motion to do a lot of this sort of stuff.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.600]   But yeah, I think I saw I saw Ray, I think I saw the version of that same talk released
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:44.400]   the same sort of talk software at Mac tech in LA last year where, you know, he had a
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.960]   Microsoft connect box that was following him around and making sure that's like things
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.400]   on the screen behind him were tracking with him and just things pivoting and 3d and it's
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.040]   like, oh, man, it really sent me home thinking I need to learn how courts composer works.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.000]   That's like something other than emotion.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   I've played with it.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.200]   It's fun.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   You can do you know, if you if you learn it, you can do some screen you can do your own
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   screen savers.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   They're nuts.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.760]   Like when they go to do client pitches, they make sure that even though it's a comp, they
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.040]   make sure the clock is changing.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.960]   So people think it's a real screen.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   You really detail oriented.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.960]   Awesome.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   Awesome.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   Awesome.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   Awesome.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.960]   I love that.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.160]   A couple of more quotes from all things D fall into digital is games talking are good friend
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.280]   Liz games talking to Eric Schmidt.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:35.720]   He's revealed that Andra is doing one and a half million activations a day now, one
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:41.960]   and a half million activations a day.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.520]   I don't know what that is.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.800]   Is that it's not tablets.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.560]   It's got to be phones and it's not in the US.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.840]   It's mostly cheap phones cheap phones in China or something, right?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.720]   That's that's why it's kind of hard to compare when people there are some people who are
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.960]   saying that, Oh, well, let's see, this is why apples and trouble because the saturation
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.760]   of Android is far suppressing.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.280]   Yeah, but they're not but they're not activating the same kinds of high end phones that Apple
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.360]   is activating.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.200]   And they're not the sort of people who like to spend a lot of money after they activate
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   this phone.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.320]   So it's very much it's an apples and orange such a way.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   It's still impressive.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   Okay.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   35 million new users.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.800]   It's that that doesn't that doesn't happen because Google is failing to create a product
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.040]   that enables a kind of product that people want to have.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   Right.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.760]   We never got numbers of activations for embedded Linux, but I'm guessing it's like this is
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.960]   the new trend that Android is going to be used instead of Linux for a base foundation
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.200]   for a lot of stuff to come on.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.840]   Well, and I just saw Linux and it's also a station that points out that, you know,
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.200]   Linux is running Android and that that means that Linux is the most used operating system
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.640]   in the world by far.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.000]   But that that points out that points out another thing.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.640]   There's a reason why we're getting this number.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.480]   That's because this is a number that makes Google and Android look very, very, very, very
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   good.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.240]   And there's a reason why Apple will give you the numbers on sales of certain devices,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   but on other devices.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   Right.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.720]   Well, why some products are just a hobby and some people are we're proud here is exactly
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.520]   how much business we did this this month versus the versus the previous month.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.880]   And here's the graph for that.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.880]   So that was one quote.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.800]   And then the what was the other quote from all things to you?
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   Oh, cried.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.720]   I forgot another germane quote.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.760]   Tons of great Eric Smith ones.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:26.360]   He was he was Eric's always like like Mr. Toad's wild ride in these speeches.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   And I can only imagine what the Google handlers they're just like holding their breath the
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   whole time.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.160]   You probably hired bombers ex people.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.240]   He doesn't dance around on stage.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:42.840]   So you got to you got to admire that Foxconn apparently steps up hiring after the new year
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.400]   to get ready for a new iPhone.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.200]   That's about right if we were going to see a September release, right?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.760]   And what's great about this story is that it follows only a month or two after Foxconn
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   slash his job.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   I mean, just got to love all this.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:04.560]   Some say 95 Mac is quoting a 12 megapixel camera on the next iPhone.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   I have not heard that.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.320]   I heard that it would have a better camera.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.880]   I did not hear it have more megapixels.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   And I really hope they don't.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.040]   I mean, when you look at the Nokia 920 like the Lumia 920 or you look at the HTC one with
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.840]   their, you know, four megapixels.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.320]   We want bigger microns.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.480]   We want more photons.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.680]   We want optical image stabilization.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.120]   I have no desire to post to print a poster size print from my iPhone.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.120]   Absolutely correct.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.560]   And Apple is a company always that they like to promote better, not more.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   Right.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.560]   So that's, that's what you would see.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.080]   You would see better photos, not necessarily more megapixels.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.160]   More is more of Samsung's turf, which is, and our new camera has 28 megapixels, but
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.640]   does it take 28 megapixels, but does it take better?
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.360]   20 is a much larger number.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.360]   I apologize.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   It's a larger number because it takes better pictures moving on.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   Okay, then.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.360]   Well, one thing Apple's.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   I think what they did.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.360]   Go ahead.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   12 this year, right?
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   12 is around.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.560]   The four, the, the, the, the Galaxy S34 is again more.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   I'm really intrigued.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.760]   I'm, I got that one and I'm very excited.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.280]   I spent my own hard earned cash because I just want to see, I just have high hopes.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.440]   Now I'm reading the reviews as they come in and they're still image.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.760]   You know, the best image is still the iPhone five.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   There's just nothing else.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.560]   And he nailed it weeks ago where he said that you can make a camera much better and certain,
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.080]   like, you know, low light on stationary objects, but it's not a well-rounded every day.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.240]   I want to, you know, keep my family's magic moments with me.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Right.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:32.720]   One thing Apple does dominate in the, in pay for of the highest paid employees at the
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.920]   S&P 500 companies are not CEOs.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:42.600]   They're Apple executives who've been highly paid to stick around like Bob Mansfield.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:48.440]   We talked about that Bruce Sewell, Jeffrey Williams, Peter Oppenheimer, big bucks for
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   these guys.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.360]   I imagine mostly stock grants.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.320]   Mansfield got $85.5 million in stock.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   Give me a little heart attack here is base salary, $805,000, but then lots of stock.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:11.920]   Apple doesn't, of course, comment on any of this, but the board said the stock grants
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.160]   should be, quote, meaningful in size in order to retain the company's executive team during
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.800]   the CEO transition.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:22.760]   I imagine it was hard when jobs, when jobs took off and then, and then passed away, that
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.280]   it was, that there was some feeling like, okay, time to move on.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.360]   Most of these people were jobs guys, right?
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.440]   How can they quote their busy swimming in their money bin?
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.240]   I mean, I would be.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.880]   Well, I mean, you can see how they farming.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:40.320]   I could see how like Apple really needs to retain these executives because you don't want
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.520]   them like heading off like Ron Johnson and like creating that.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.280]   He had a JCPenney.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.280]   Wow.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   We talked about that last week.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   Fire.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.240]   Apple's face didn't work out so good.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.240]   Dangerous.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.920]   Might be might help to have something better than stretch pants to sell.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.400]   I'm just saying a tool is Apple's chief counsel.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:06.440]   He got $69 million in stock and Williams, senior vice president of operation got $68
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.600]   million in stock.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   That's a nice grant.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.960]   Of course, Apple's stock has to remain high for that to be worth something and then stock
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.400]   has been going down a little bit.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.720]   Well, yeah, I think a lot of them have cashed out over the last year a little bit.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.880]   Yeah, take the money and run.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   No, don't run.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.960]   Take the money and stay.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.680]   The number of executives at Apple that now have what might be termed giraffe money, you
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.480]   know, is just incredible.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.080]   That's a, you think it never land.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.880]   Are you, I'm going to move on.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.000]   I'm saying that there's a level of wealth where if it occurs to you, you'd like to own
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.720]   a giraffe, you can own a giraffe.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   Why not?
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.400]   Someone will find a giraffe for you.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.720]   So you will have the acreage and build you a giraffe farm.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.960]   You can hire a guy to take care of the giraffe.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.880]   And then three months later, you can be in your back, like, Hey, what's that giraffe doing
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   there?
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   That's the giraffe that you bought.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.880]   Oh, I don't even have to notice.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.680]   I wanted a giraffe with lasers.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:02.160]   I want to run an osserus.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.720]   Six legs.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.160]   But the, the real, the real pro, I always think that maybe I'm wrong, but I would think the
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.880]   real problem is that when people get that wealthy, they kind of lose interest.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.600]   It's like, you know, I could, I have so much money.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.120]   I don't have to work.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.640]   I should be on my boat.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:22.360]   Well, on the other hand, once you have that much money, money is no longer of interest
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.360]   to you.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.840]   So you've got to figure that people who are still going to a job every single day, that
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.080]   by the fact that they have, you know, tens of millions of dollars, you know, at home and
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.560]   underneath the mattress, that kind of must indicate that they're, they're out to do something
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.600]   rather than just simply, you know, keep the lights on in the house.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.920]   If you have that, if you're having trouble with your Apple TV's Wi-Fi, Apple acknowledges
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.000]   there's a small number of TVs, Apple TVs that have that problem.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.480]   They are doing a replacement program.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.600]   They're paying $53 million to settle an iPhone warranty lawsuit.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   Who cares?
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   I don't care.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.640]   Moving, moving through these pretty quickly.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.080]   We've talked, have we talked about the crack down in the app store?
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.120]   The app grad is being kicked out and so forth.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.120]   Maybe not.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.680]   It's a continually evolving story.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.800]   They always do this, you know.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.000]   Their app grad is like, who us, we, what did we do?
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.600]   And a lot of people are saying, well, you were trying to sell top spots in the app store.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.880]   That's one way to do it.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.040]   This is an interesting one.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.000]   And this comes from nine to five Mac also.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.160]   Kevin Lynch, the Adobe CTO, they recently hired the guy.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.160]   Everybody said, wait a minute.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.880]   He was in charge of flash.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.760]   He's not going to be working on flash.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:43.560]   French site, Mac G says that he'll be going to work on iWatch reporting directly to Bob
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.560]   Mansfield.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.920]   I read the French version and they, they, there's a reporting in that and then there's
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.800]   a gap and then there is that kind of link is named to iWatch.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   Okay.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.800]   So it's speculation.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   It's a head.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.160]   It's nice to have a Francophone here in the show.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.760]   I don't know what in Kevin Lynch's background would make him the guy you want running.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   He's a software guy.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.440]   We're, we're still at the spot and I watch rumors where anytime someone says something
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.560]   concrete like that, I get a little suspicious.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.520]   I think we're still, I still, I think we all are waiting for one or two other markers before
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.160]   we start to think of it as something that we can expect to see as opposed to an idea
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:23.880]   that Apple just thinks is interesting or, or in this case, like just a basic concept
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.200]   that we should make computers that are more wearable and more personable.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.960]   And we don't know how we're going to articulate that idea yet, but we know it's definitely
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.280]   worth the least messing around with.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.600]   And of course, Microsoft says, Oh, no, we got to watch too.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.600]   It'll be this big.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.400]   Everyone's got a watch except for Apple.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   The phone numbers.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.600]   Actually, to, to Microsoft's credit, they did really invent.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.160]   I mean, they did the spot watch.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.960]   They, they were, they've been doing this just like tablets.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.920]   Tablet PC for 10 years with, and they killed it.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.200]   I'm sort of going to turn the failure to execute where they have all these wonderful
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.680]   technology ideas that they just don't understand.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.680]   Oh, I'm wrong.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.480]   These are not wonderful technology ideas.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.680]   I got to tell you, I've used XP tablets, crap.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.520]   I've used the spot watch crap.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.960]   The idea for the watch or a tablet is not bad.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.040]   Just the execution of that idea by Microsoft was sub-optimal.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.520]   More than sub-optimal.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.360]   Not just, not just the execution, but not appreciating that you can't just put out a
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.240]   great technology and expect it to be to work great on its own.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   It has to be released into a world that that's such a product makes sense.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   Exactly.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.480]   The spot watch didn't make much sense years ago when really all it was going to do was
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.480]   give you the weather.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.560]   I think that for a lot of the cool features that actually required a monthly subscription
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   has this micro broadcast to your watch.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   Nobody wants that.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.520]   Nobody wants that information.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.080]   When you're able to sell a watch that's essentially like a blank screen that a user can project
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:51.640]   into exactly anything that's interesting on their phone, that becomes really, really cool.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.480]   Interesting idea, but if you were an Apple idea, Apple would have built something like
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.400]   that and then thought, "Great, but what are people going to do with it?"
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   And then put it on the shelf.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   They're all we know they did.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400]   Well, that was that famous Steve Jobs for the movie.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.400]   Because I'm not releasing this tablet until it's worth something more than a computer
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.400]   in the bathroom.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.400]   Right.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400]   Although it's a pretty darn good computer in the bathroom.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.480]   No, I think that that really points to the fact that it's not merely the conception that
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.840]   where the rubber hits the road is where you make a product that people want to use.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:25.600]   So anybody in the 70s and 80s could have said, "You know, tablet, there were tablet
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.720]   computers all over the place.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.200]   There was slate."
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.840]   But that's not the idea.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840]   It's all about execution.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.600]   The ideas are easy.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.040]   Well, and to be fair, the slates that brand Windows XP were successful to a certain extent
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.560]   because there were applications in the medical industry and the internet industry that needed
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560]   a device like that.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.160]   So they sold kind of okay.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.960]   But the chief problem was that unless Microsoft wanted to invent the concept of the mobile
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.160]   processor, that was never going to become a mainstream product unless they wanted to
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.160]   invent a really inexpensive high density memory, it was never going to be a viable product.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.280]   It took a while for those processors and that's kind of storage and multitouch to really
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.800]   emphatically say, here is a computer that can only exist as a tablet.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.440]   And here's a computer that you're going to understand as soon as you take it out of the
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   box.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:19.120]   A judge in Florida spanks Apple and Google saying, "The parties have no interest in efficiently
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.880]   and expeditiously, they're deliciously resolving their dispute.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.280]   They instead are using this and similar litigation worldwide as a business strategy that seems
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.760]   to have no end."
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.360]   This is not a proper use of this court.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   They were suing, of course, over patents.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.360]   This is the suit that never ends.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.680]   It just goes on and on.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:48.720]   My friends, some lawyers started suing just because now they're filing motions and we
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.080]   are on and on and on.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:58.640]   It's a good new campfire song by Andy Inaco and Judge Skola.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.640]   Bill, do you ring total at $140 per person?
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.440]   Anybody buy a iPhone at T-Mobile?
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.880]   They say sales are gangbusters, $99 iPhone 5s.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.680]   There were actually lines at T-Mobile stores to buy these.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.080]   T-Mobile, of course, is introducing its new concept of the contract-free mobile carrier
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   and so forth.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.880]   Leanna from I'mor bought one and then she spent the rest of the day driving around San Jose
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.400]   trying to get an LTE sick.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400]   Oh crap.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.600]   Well, forget LTE.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.800]   The real point on this is there's so few people have T-Mobile phones that HSPA+ is in
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.440]   some cases faster than LTE because nobody's using it.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.440]   Yeah, dual channel stuff.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.160]   The dual channel stuff was really fast.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   So take it.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.160]   Yeah, if you can get it.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.200]   Check, make sure that you can get it in your area and if you can, it's fantastic.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.840]   CMO, T-Mobile CMO Mike Seaver says, "Today's been gangbusters for T-Mobile.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.880]   Lines out the door at a nearly all of our almost 3,000 stores.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.280]   They want the iPhone 5."
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.840]   I think that's great.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.920]   But yeah, don't get it for LTE.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.800]   Get it because is it unlocked?
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   You can.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.360]   You can get the one with the T-Mobile SIM and you can get an unlocked version.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.720]   That's awesome.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.680]   And they're wearing bright magenta apple t-shirts to sell it to you, which is awesome.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.880]   That's the magenta is the T-Mobile car.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.240]   So $99 is off contract, but you commit to paying what, 20 bucks a month?
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   Yes.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.960]   So you're paying more.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.720]   I don't know how that's any different from having a contract.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   They're hedging.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.400]   They're trying to approach the non-contract world, but they realize that a lot of people
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.760]   have sticker shock in North America.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.040]   So they're trying to do something to mitigate.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.240]   If you walked in and saw a $650 iPhone, you'd probably run over to Verizon.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   So they're trying to...
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.440]   I have my T-Mobile account, but my iPhone's Verizon.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.200]   My HTC One's AT&T.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.480]   I have a Galaxy Note 2 on Sprint, which never works because there's no signal anywhere.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   And then I'm going to get my Galaxy S4 on T-Mobile because I like walking around with
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.400]   four phones in my pocket.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.560]   You're a bad belt.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   My bad belt.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   I do.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.120]   I need a utility belt.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.360]   More claims of Samsung being cut out of Apple's A7 chip development.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.960]   Currently, Samsung is the sole supplier of chips for Apple iOS devices.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   Is that right?
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.840]   Yeah, they're planted in the US.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.960]   Korea in times reporting Samsung has been excluded from the next generation chip, which
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.840]   would be out sometime in 2014.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.160]   They reported, I think, four times now over the last 12 or so.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.880]   Someday it'll be true.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.040]   The new incumbent Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.240]   There's not a lot of fabs in the world that can do the volume that Apple needs.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.240]   And I don't know if they can.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.600]   You know, Intel, if they ever decided to get to that business, could.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.080]   But it's, there's not a lot of--
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.440]   Intel doesn't do ARM, of course.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.880]   That's their problem right now.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.360]   They got to figure out a way to compete with ARM.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.440]   I don't, you know, just because you're in court with Samsung doesn't mean you can't
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.200]   still be a customer of a different division.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.560]   It's like a cadetsu, like those Japanese conglomerates where they have so many different
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.800]   divisions and the mobile division and the component division are really--
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]   I doubt it.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.120]   --are in one Samsung CEO.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.360]   I doubt anybody's looking over at the construction site in Cupertino saying, no Samsung bulldozers
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.360]   here over my dead body.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360]   Those are Samsung toilets.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   Get them out of here.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   Is that a blue logo on your rice cooker?
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.360]   I'm not out.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.040]   Well, I think I don't--
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.920]   I think Apple still have Samsung television sets and there's stories.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.120]   I mean, you know, that can't possibly be the rationale.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.320]   That's why I don't buy this.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.520]   Yeah, no, I absolutely don't.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.840]   If Steve Jobs were still in charge, then I might imagine that.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   Not even then.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.800]   I think that someone would talk him down and say, yeah, here is the best chip that's available.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.320]   It is made by Samsung.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.720]   Are you going to care that enough that we're going to put a substandard chip that's going
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.200]   to cost someone 28 minutes of battery life per charge?
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.000]   And then you'd say, nope, I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   Great.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.240]   It's not like one of the things is the building it.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.000]   But the other thing is that there's a certain paranoia that whatever they put into there--
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.680]   because Apple's designing their own chips now.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.760]   They're not just using off the shelf arm and power VR components anymore.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.800]   And that was the whole point of the A6.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.200]   And if they do a bunch of really neat stuff on the A7, some people just don't want to
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   give it to Samsung.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.640]   They say, here look, that's what the next Exynos is going to use.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.720]   Well, and that's what somebody in the chatroom with 3462 is saying Samsung was caught sharing
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.400]   secrets from their semiconductor business with their mobile business.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.280]   So maybe it is more than just a peak.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:28.320]   Yeah, if you're certain extent Apple taught Google and Samsung how to compete against
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320]   them.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.400]   You have to be careful about going forward.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.400]   I mean, yeah.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:41.880]   9 to 5 Mac, Zach Hall reporting, BlackBerry denying that over 50% returns of BlackBerry
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:47.600]   10, 71% of people don't want a BlackBerry under any circumstances.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.920]   83% of Americans completely unaware that there is a new BlackBerry.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.760]   Yeah, that was a bad story.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.000]   Bad in what way?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   Do you think it's untrue?
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   Yeah, it's completely untrue.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.920]   If you talk about it, BlackBerry, when spoke to BlackBerry, they're seeing exactly the
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   same return rates they see on any of their previous normal industry average for smartphones
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.560]   in that price category.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.320]   Yeah, 53% would be horrible.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.080]   And they're probably, I mean, some people think they could lie about that, but you can't
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.080]   because eventually their earnings will come out and if they gave misleading statements,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.320]   you know, they can't do.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   Right.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   Good.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320]   All right.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   So we'll throw it out.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   Forget I even mentioned it.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.760]   I did return my BlackBerry, but that's, do you still have your Zden?
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.760]   I do, actually.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.080]   I don't have the Rogers one, I have Verizon one now, it's going to be in New York.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.640]   Yeah, it wasn't bad.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.880]   I mean, if you love BlackBerry, I wouldn't say don't get it.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:44.080]   If you're, if you use a BBM or BIS and I wouldn't, or BES, I wouldn't suggest not getting it,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.960]   but it's just not, you know, it's not, it's not as rich an ecosystem as they say.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.200]   I really, I really wish that I get to see what it's, I hope it survives long enough that
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.080]   they do a refresh in 2014.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   Right.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:01.280]   So it's a really great basic ideas, not great execution and not a lot of consistency throughout
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.280]   the device, but again, a lot of really great ideas.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.800]   This is definitely an Obama phone.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.320]   I venture beaten.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.280]   Thank you again to the chat room for another recommendation reports that Samsung's Galaxy
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.480]   S4 will mark the beginning of the end of Samsung in smartphones.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:25.400]   There's so much crap where the Galaxy S4 they say they added value that people are just
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.640]   going to go barf barf.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.080]   Now this is a editorial.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:38.120]   You know, one of the things they're quoting an analyst, Avi Greengard, who said that the
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.480]   hover feature doesn't work.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.040]   I have to say, I am training my mother in a very bold experiment.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.200]   My 80 year old mom who is computer literate, she has an iPad and she has a laptop, a Mac
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.360]   laptop and so forth, but she needed a smartphone to be her first smartphone, Galaxy Note 2.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.480]   She is interested because of the style of she's an artist and she can, you know, sketch
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.800]   and so forth.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.880]   And the analyst is saying the hover doesn't work right.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.640]   It's actually a great feature for her because she can hover the pin over controls, not tap
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.400]   them, but hover and the controls pop up with a tool tip that tells you what that control
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.400]   does.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.840]   And that is a useful feature for her and she's able to use it quite well.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.960]   I tried it at the launch event.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.200]   The problem I have is that it kind of breaks Fitz's law, which is like the anything that
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.160]   you can go to infinity is easier.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.000]   So if you touch a screen, the screen stops your finger and it rests on it.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.520]   So you have a high accuracy hovering is just harder because, you know, your finger might
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.120]   move in and out of the right depth for the hover, but provided you have fairly good eye
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.600]   hand coordination or you have a stylus and it works really well.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.720]   It works well with the stylus.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.760]   I wouldn't try with the finger.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.760]   You're right.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.960]   Works very well with the stylus.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.800]   And the problem is you have to take almost every feature that Samsung demonstrates with
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   a grain of salt because they do a lot of features that demo really well.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.520]   Then you it works and it also demos great in your hand, but then about two days later,
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.240]   you find yourself never using it.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.320]   And then worse, you'll find that it interferes with something.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.280]   So you switch it off and forget that you ever even heard it in the first place.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280]   Right.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.560]   The other problem with the hover feature, a lot of the features on the Galaxy S4, the
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.000]   problem is that Samsung can't get their hooks into everything.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.520]   So they can, for example, the hover, I think works in the Samsung male client, but not
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.240]   in Gmail because they can't integrate into Google's apps.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.360]   And when you have system level features that aren't everywhere in the system, then it becomes
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.440]   hard to make those muscle memory because you're never quite sure when they work or not.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:30.400]   Great story by Derek Harris in Gigahome this week talking about what we're here at the
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.760]   13th anniversary of the release of the iPod.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:40.080]   And he's interviewing a Grace Notes founder and CTO, Ty Roberts.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.920]   Ty said in April 2000, they got a call from Apple.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.480]   He said that would change our business forever.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   Apple said, we're not going to give you any specifics, but you should buy more servers.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:11:04.440]   When Apple calls, it says, what is a board member of Apple's also own stock and a server?
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.920]   The holiday season.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.440]   I'm telling you, by stock and Spidell watcher.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   Have you heard of Akamai?
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.600]   The holiday season, right, Stairick, particularly Christmas morning provides a clear example
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.560]   of how stark the change was.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.920]   Robert says, we used to call it iPod day because the company's servers would go crazy
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.360]   as people opened their new iPods and began ripping CDs on their computers.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.920]   Of course, that's when it went to Grace Note to get the CD information.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.720]   The chief scientist would stay up 20 hours a day for five days straight to make sure
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.200]   the database didn't crash under the load.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   I love it.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.960]   Sony now owns Grace Note and I bought them a few years ago.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.560]   Only they'd done a queue if you'd had a number of thousands of people ahead of you to get
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560]   your receipt.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.560]   Oh my God.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:55.000]   The database is still running under Sony's Aegis and it gets 15 billion queries a month.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.080]   That's half a billion queries a day.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.040]   That's amazing.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   That's truly amazing.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.600]   I ripped a CD last night.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.560]   Of course, it goes out, goes to the Grace Note servers, looks it up.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.280]   That's not an insignificant transaction.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.880]   That's not such a quick, hey, how you doing?
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   What's up?
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.200]   You got to do some data back and forth there.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:19.280]   It's a big deal, although I think that it is probably one of the top nine, maybe even
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:24.960]   top five instigators of bad karma on the planet because how many times you insert a CD that
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.080]   looked at the result saying, really, you decided to make the composer of track number
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.240]   one, the artist on every single track.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:38.400]   God damn you, Mr. Whoever it was, a 1988 who first ripped the CD.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.520]   That's right because this was originally all user contributed data, right?
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520]   It was CDDB.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.600]   That always kind of bugged me a little bit.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.640]   The CDDB, which was like IMDB, was everybody chipped in, you'd rip a CD, it wasn't in the
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.120]   database, you'd hand enter all of the stuff and now it's in the database and then they
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.440]   went commercial and sold it.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.880]   It's like, come on.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   That's not right.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.800]   And they over wrote your careful information with someone crappies information from the
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   company.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:11.680]   The Apple pop up museum in what used to be an Atlanta Comp USA store.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.680]   I want to go see this.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:18.320]   I don't, Lonnie Mims set this up as a 6,000 square foot display of the company's history
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.480]   from blue boxes.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:25.160]   Yes, they have some blue boxes, Waz and Jobs designed two iPhones.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.080]   It's all from Lonnie's personal collection.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:31.760]   Apparently, he owns not just a lot of Apple stuff.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.080]   He owns everything.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.280]   But I would love to see this.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.880]   I'll have to go to, if you're in Atlanta, you might want to, what the hell is that?
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.640]   Is that a portable Mac?
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   Wow.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.240]   You thought your iPad was thick.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.080]   But the battery life.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.240]   15 minutes if you have the extended.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.240]   This is great.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.800]   I think this is a fun idea for a, we have that.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.720]   It's the 25th anniversary Macintosh or 20th anniversary Macintosh.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.200]   And it even boots.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.200]   I feel we actually have almost some of this museum.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   We really should boot some of this stuff up every once in a while.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   I'm going to my storage unit in a couple of days to get a certain item that I think
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.600]   is going to look good sitting behind me.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.200]   Every time someone sees it, it's the most, it's the straightest route towards feeling
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.880]   like an old, old frickin man.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:30.680]   You see, oh, he started an Apple museum saying, actually, I probably own one of all these,
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.120]   not because I'm a collector, but because I have bought them.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.680]   Everyone, those I just never threw them out.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.120]   I am sure there's no version of Mac that I haven't bought.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.280]   I am positive of that.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.600]   I can't think of a single one.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.600]   It says that portable, was that a Mac or is that a Lisa?
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.280]   Look like a, look like a Mac.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.080]   But that was a third party.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   Hack of it, right?
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.600]   I didn't recognize it, but it had all the badging of a Mac.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:57.320]   I also didn't recognize it as anything that ever shipped as a third party product.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.840]   I did not buy that.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.080]   Look at the lower left corner.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.480]   Yeah, that's a company doing a third party hack.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.520]   Well, there it is.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520]   All of the wallbound did a conversion.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.520]   The Colby.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.520]   That's the Colby.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   I remember that.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   Yes, I'm sorry.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520]   I did look from there.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520]   I did not own the Colby.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:21.720]   So I wallbound did a really great, did some really great clones in which drove Apple crazy
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.400]   because they couldn't sue them because all you've copyrighted is the ROMs and ships
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.400]   without ROMs.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.880]   It's not up to us with somebody will have to get some ROMs.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.880]   If users are buying these laptops that have no ROMs in them and then choosing to flash
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.760]   illegal ROMs, that's not in our control.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.000]   We just thought people would be buying this as a lovely OJ dart.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   You're right, Jambick.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.120]   He did not buy the 20th anniversary Mac because it was outrageously costly.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.120]   It wasn't bucked.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.040]   But I now own it.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   So it says retro, retro ownership count.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.440]   I think retro ownership counts.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   I think I own it now.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.040]   That's my own it now.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.280]   And it boots.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.280]   Here's every iPod.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.360]   Now I have to say the curation of this museum leaves a little to be desired.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.280]   It looks like Post-it notes, but that's okay.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.160]   Those are vintage 1980s.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160]   Every iPod.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.760]   There's the U2 red and black iPod bought that one for my sister.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.960]   But where's the Beatles yellow submarine I bought?
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.320]   Come on, Merlin.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.960]   Come on, Merlin, man.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.760]   Anyway, and I have you've seen this notebook line.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]   Why?
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.320]   You know, I don't think I ever owned that one.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.640]   You don't have the Mac portable?
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.000]   No, that was the first Mac portable, right?
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.200]   I have the later, some of the later ones.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.120]   Okay, so I still remember borrowing the Boston Computer Society's Mac portable and actually
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.720]   running hypercard on the commuter rail train home from Boston and thinking, oh my God,
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:54.600]   I am doing something that no child ever thought he would ever be doing using a Macintosh.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.880]   No, that was in the 8-hounds.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   I know.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:04.120]   I remember showing my father-in-law the 5200s saying, look at this, it's a mate.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   That's a track ball.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.600]   But doesn't that define why we love what we do?
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.160]   Because there's still technologies like that that says, oh my God, I would love to take
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.960]   this iPad back in time and show it to myself.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:16.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.400]   Well, the iPad, this is something that will really exist that people can actually buy.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.520]   And it's not even by any stretch of the imagination, the most expensive thing this company sells.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   It's just a consumer item.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.280]   I remember reading neuromancer and he had a computer in neuromancer.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.400]   It was all beat up that had all of the world's knowledge on it.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.200]   And effectively, that's what we've got.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.080]   Thanks to Wikipedia and the internet and archive.org.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   Everything's on there.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.640]   It will start tracking everything up.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   It's not a retina screen.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   I don't know about it.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.640]   I'm thinking that I won't leave.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.280]   It hurts my eyes.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.280]   It's so low res.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.160]   Remember when we used to make a big deal about millions of colors?
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.160]   Yeah, right?
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.640]   Hey, I still think that EGA graphics is pretty cool.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:06.960]   That's a very interesting shade of pink and blue that has never been seen anywhere in
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.080]   the world except for on an IBM PC AT graphics card.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.120]   You had to design websites that had web ready colors.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.520]   Yes.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.680]   And you only, there was only like 16 of them.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.520]   And fonts and those.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.520]   And fonts.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.520]   And the red car could take into downtown LA for just a nickel.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.520]   Yeah, remember those days.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520]   I just swim to Europe.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.920]   All right, we're going to take a break.

[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:09.320]   Like almost any book and you cancel within the first 30 days, you pay nothing.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.320]   There are so many great choices.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.680]   If you're listening to Mac Break Weekly Audible is offering you a free audio book to give
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.480]   you a chance to just see how you feel about audible.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.120]   Andy, I'm listening right now to among others by Joe Walton, which is a wonderful book about
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.040]   a Welsh girl and Catherine Kellgren who reads it does the greatest Welsh accent.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.040]   It's so fun to listen to.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.480]   It's one of the things I like about Audible is the readers.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   I just love it.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.560]   I'm pictures that a revolution is next in my queue because that was the one you recommended
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560]   about Hollywood.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.840]   I can't wait to read that.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:46.520]   I made a pick this with the last book that I bought is I picked it for exactly that reason
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:52.840]   you say that, you know, there are readers that the material is almost not important because
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:59.240]   I remember for some reason a Bob Balaben who is just legendary stage actor and screen
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.960]   actor is one of those guys that you know the face and you know, has any love just performance
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.680]   as you don't know the name.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.760]   He was actually the first Linus in the original production of Your Good Men Charlie Brown.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   Did you know that?
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.680]   I did not figure that out exactly.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:17.360]   And it was like one of those records that was always in like my parents, my parents stereo
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.480]   and listen to it like a million times without knowing that, oh, you're that actor that really
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.040]   like he was actually Linus.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.040]   Okay, that's interesting.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.240]   What a way to start.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.680]   So he joined Twitter that made me think that, oh, I just love, I love his voice and I wonder
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.880]   if he's narrated any books.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.240]   And then so I went down to Audible and find out that brilliant casting.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:41.960]   He narrated Warren Litterfield's book about his tenure as the head of head at NBC during
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:48.360]   the 90s, which is funny because he because Bob Balaben played essentially Warren Little
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.640]   Field on Seinfeld.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.400]   He was like the guy who bought like Jerry Seinfeld's new TV show.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.400]   That's right.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   I don't know what that's right.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   I remember that.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.400]   It's just show about nothing.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.160]   And that's actually an accurate executive.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.880]   And incidentally, it turned out that that's actually a fun book because it really it starts
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:11.680]   off the book by describing what it was like at the up fronts in 1992, 1993 and expecting
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.240]   that telling everybody, hey, don't worry, there's going to be a really great surprise
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:19.160]   knowing that as as skeptical as all the TV critics were in that auditorium that they're
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.680]   going to be told about really great TV shows that are going to take this number eight network
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.200]   and turn its fortunes around.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.360]   Oh boy, you're going to really love this guest knowing that Johnny Carson is going to come
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.080]   out and be funny and really lift everybody up.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.160]   And he had no idea that Johnny Carson had decided the night before that I'm going to
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.160]   tell everybody I'm retiring at the end of the year.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.200]   And this is at a time when the Tonight Show was the only show that was actually successful
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.200]   on the whole.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.200]   That mean the heart.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.680]   Top of the rock inside the rise and fall of must see TV.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.680]   Can I play a little bit?
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.160]   Let me play a little bit of this because I love you'll recognize Bob's voice.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.160]   Skip.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   I can't skip, unfortunately.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.200]   I have to just make sure they don't play the introduction.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.200]   That's all.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.200]   Let's see.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200]   Can you hear it?
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.480]   Well, maybe that's going to be moot.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.040]   Maybe you don't see my committee.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:09.480]   The only problem is that the book starts with it's it's it's it's he interviewed like dozens
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.600]   and dozens of executives and stars for this book.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.360]   So there's lots of really great behind the scenes stuff about cheers and all these other
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360]   shows.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.000]   But unfortunately, the introduction starts off with just cast of characters.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.960]   So it's nothing but like 20 minutes of Bob, like saying Ted Danson star of cheers from
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:29.160]   the 1980s with bumping along well enough by 1983 to make us hopeful of its eventual
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160]   success.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.040]   But it was no world beat or quite yet.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.280]   The conventional thinking among the entertainment press was that the half hour comedy was dead.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.680]   And most of the print interviews I gave at the time took the form of comedy post mortems.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   You recognize that voice.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680]   I love Bob Alabama.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   I just love him.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.320]   Here's if you liked that the war for late night is also an audible.com.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   That's a good one.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:54.160]   I'm not timely now that Jimmy Fallon's going to step up for a J Leno.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.200]   This is one I want to read it won the just one that Pulitzer Prize for fiction for 2013.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:04.040]   The orphan masters son a novel of North Korea, kind of a spy novel about North Korea, one
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.640]   of Pulitzer Prize just a few days ago.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.880]   Look, here's the deal.

[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.160]   The only hard thing is going to be pick that one book.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.760]   That's why you want the subscription every month.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.040]   The new book.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.280]   I love my audible and he loves his audible.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.360]   You're going to love it too.

[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   This is really hard.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.400]   I have so many books now, such a backlog.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.880]   And I just I can't listen enough.
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.680]   I turn it on all the time now while I'm making the bed.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:35.680]   I listen audible.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.680]   You had Apple shares.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.960]   Leo, we could hire people to listen to them for you.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.000]   Well, I'm in my money bath.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.080]   Renee Richie, you're good.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080]   Go ahead.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080]   Go ahead.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.080]   Go ahead.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.080]   Go ahead.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.000]   But unfortunately if you don't say in the first three right. Oh, no access and I killed it, Ibladov. I killed a joke
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.200]   I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, you you you you've prevented me from wasting people's time
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.340]   Okay, good
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:02.340]   Good
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:07.040]   Let's get your pick of the week, mr. Renee Richie. I have two picks of the week
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:13.720]   They are both apps that just came out and they are both terrific the first one is called mini display and it's from adovia
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:19.920]   that people who make screens and they're working on screens three so they took all the new VNC stuff that they've been working on and
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:27.600]   They made a simpler app that basically just lets you turn your iPad or iPhone into an extension of your Mac display cool
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:33.760]   It works really really well. I was one of the beta testers. So I got to see it as it progressed but
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.160]   There's a little bit of latency because of the way that it works
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:44.900]   But if you want to just put your mail client or your Twitter client or your Photoshop palette or something off to the side
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:50.640]   especially if you have a smaller laptop display or you just you have too much stuff crowding your main display
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.280]   It's I've been using it for two weeks or so and it's become indispensable, especially while traveling
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:59.160]   I'm loading it right now
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.760]   How much is that?
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.460]   It's I think twelve or fourteen dollars there it is twelve ninety nine
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:08.760]   That's twelve ninety nine and you need to have it both on your desktop and your well
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.580]   This Mac is a free utility. You just run it
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:16.160]   It does it's one of those just works sort of a thing you run it on your Mac and it just finds it and it just works
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.840]   And I'm happy that people are charging, you know
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.900]   I a lot of free apps have just disappeared
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.900]   They've been bought or the developers had to sell where they couldn't continue
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:30.320]   So I'm more than happy to pay twelve dollars for something that I will use three hundred sixty five days out of this next year
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   Yeah, it's almost no money to me
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:39.180]   The second one is just delightful. It's status board and it's by panic and they've been teasing people for a long time
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:46.920]   With this double tell this first a single and now a double television display that they have in the panic office that shows status for everything
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.280]   They're working on and they've turned it into an iOS app
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:56.040]   So basically it can look into all your calendars and your Twitter accounts and your mail accounts and show you that stuff
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:02.480]   But it's also really clever in that you can do your own markup and pump information like App Store sales
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.700]   or
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:07.500]   How many tickets you have in a ticket tracking system if you're a developer and
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.900]   You can also it's an interesting model
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:13.520]   It's ten dollars for the app and if you want to be able to show it through a
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.460]   Television set you can enable airplay or HDMI out for another ten dollars
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:22.980]   And it's it's not aimed for the normal person because no people don't need this stuff
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:30.380]   It's aimed for businesses if you want sort of like the last picture a beautiful television display that's sitting in your coding room
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.980]   Twenty bucks is a trivial trivial price compared to what it's gonna cost to set up
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:42.700]   I know a custom sort of a board and it will not have anything like the design sensibility of cable sacers
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:49.720]   Stephen Frank and nevin Morgan somebody sent me an email. I'm trying to find it that they made a status board plugin
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.540]   For us
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:56.920]   Yeah, oh for you that for us. I don't know what it would but what metrics it would show but some people have done
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:03.440]   Libson plugins already some people have done hockey hockey app has a way for you to plug in your beta downloads stats
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.500]   There's a public service. I forget the name now. It's some sort of
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.500]   data aggregator that will let you you know put random data in and
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:13.240]   Get that put into padding for a very cool
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:17.780]   It's a brilliant little status board not cheap ten dollars and then tell them always more for airplay
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:22.760]   But we could use it for instance to show tweets about us or I mean there just I mean the app
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.860]   we had a very expensive elaborate
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:31.560]   Status thing for tweets alone, and this is so simple so 20 bucks nothing
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.580]   And that's the thing is you need a dedicated iPad and a television set right at $20 you spend on status
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.840]   Nothing right it's around here
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.320]   We should play with that Chad think of what we could put in a status board and put up on our our big
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.720]   Yeah, we could and we have all the all the bits all the all the equipment right here all the bits are here
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.120]   It's be very fast ah and w in the chat room made it. It's you can go to status board
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.480]   Dot n Walker
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.360]   Dot org. Thank you NW. Let me look at this widgets for panic status board
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.220]   What's live on?
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:06.940]   Twitter with the album art and what's up next in that cool?
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.500]   So I guess it's easy to man
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.200]   How easy is HTML you can make a table or you can do a CSV file?
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.340]   And I think you can there's one other format that it'll take
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:21.320]   So that would just be a corner it wouldn't be the whole screen you can have other things other metrics
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.220]   You can have a whole you know elaborate display. That's really cool
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.460]   And you can do it vertical horizontal the widgets will try to realign themselves
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.560]   They'll jump around and do an elegant job of it
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:35.360]   But you can also just make it a static location and you know tweak it to get it to the whatever
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.920]   Exactly out you desire Nido
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.200]   That was actually Sarah Lane's app cap on iPad the day last week
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.320]   So you if you're watching iPad the day you're up on all this stuff every Thursday
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.920]   We put that out we do a 1 p.m. Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern time on Twitter
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:56.240]   TV Sarah and I talk about the latest iPad stuff Annie and I go your pick
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.880]   Actually, this this is
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:06.720]   One comment on one ace picks love both of those yeah, because it's something that's I think it's kind of important that I mean
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.920]   My workflow has sort of turned into I'll have my notebook in front of me
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.720]   But I will also have this on an easel next to me or my full-size iPad as a second screen
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.360]   And I'll have either Twitter in it or I'll have like a video that I'm watching
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.480]   And I'm just finding that I don't want lots of overlapping windows
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.480]   I do I much rather have two smaller screens
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.800]   So both of these apps that are just like just take whatever window you've got you've already spent 300 bucks for this
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.840]   You may as well have it be useful while you're what you're typing on the real computer
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.600]   Love love those those those things and this is sort of sort of similar
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.440]   I just it's a
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.600]   Constantly we're talking about I work I've decided for myself that I work is no longer a really good solution for me
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.360]   That I don't want to have to be locked into these formats
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.280]   And I don't want to be locked into iCloud syncing for what I do so I've been trying to find alternatives
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:58.160]   And unfortunately like I said earlier if you want rich text formatting again something as bizarre as I want to italicize something and see it italicize
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.280]   I don't want to be back in 1983. You're picking your slim
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.920]   for now, I've switched to a couple of apps made by the soul men
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:12.920]   One is called a dataless D A D A L A L U L U S on
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:19.040]   iOS and the other one is called Ulysses three and I've got you a lissies up here behind me
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.560]   It's a very simple and classic
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:29.240]   Classic iTunes 10 not that iTunes 11 style interface where you have you know a pain that has here all your documents that you're working on
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.160]   And you can drill deep and then start editing in the third window
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.440]   the
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.880]   Keith there two key things about it. It is one of those beautifully streamlined absolute
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.360]   Coco type apps
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:45.280]   There it's just designed to be clean. It's designed to have this classic interface
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.840]   It's not designed so that well let's do let's be really abstract about this so that we can port this to Android and port this to Windows
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.680]   It is emphatically a Mac app
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.680]   Which means that it's very very clean and very very beautiful
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:59.960]   And also if you're using both of these apps you will find that the experience of using this sort of work environment
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:06.520]   Is absolutely transparent on both of these things you can switch from you can grab your your iPad go out to the cafe and work for a couple
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:11.600]   Hours then go back to your desktop and not only will your environment look pretty much the same
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.560]   It'll all work pretty much the same, but it will also sync together very much the same
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.600]   You can sync the right cloud, but it will also work very well with Dropbox
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:24.200]   Now the only thing that I wish it had and I don't certainly don't blame the developers for this is on iOS
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.160]   You really can't do a whole lot of fancy rich text formatting
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.480]   For
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:37.680]   It is enhanced for plain text, but it's one of the few markdown editors that again does that incredibly
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:44.160]   I'm sorry to say this three times the same podcast, but I've been trying to get into my head into into markdown
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.720]   I still don't really like it
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:50.800]   But I think it's the best solution if you want to move documents from iOS to desktops and back again
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.380]   But the Ulysses excuse me a Daedalus is the first
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.880]   Davos touches the first one I've really seen where
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.280]   On the desktop and on the mobile OS you can actually use command I
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:07.480]   To type in the equivalent of the market of the markdown language and then we'll actually italicize it in front of you
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.840]   So you can see how it actually works
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:13.880]   Ah, so you don't get people always keep telling me that oh the great thing about markdown is that it's you know
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.200]   It's all plain text. Well, I don't want plain text. I want to see bold face command. I
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.760]   Do exactly I don't want to have to remember
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:26.380]   Is it an asterisk is an underline is it three three pound signs or two pound signs?
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:32.560]   I just want simple for I want Mac right 1.0 formatting and right now unfortunately markdown doesn't really do it for me
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:38.560]   But these but these tools are the best that I've seen it so far the desktop version does support rich text formatting because that's a lot easier to do
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.360]   on the desktop
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:47.560]   But I found that if you want one set of compatible apps that allows you to have a very simple very powerful very fast and more open
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:54.720]   Style formatting. This is the solution right now. I really have got my eye peeled for the upcoming release of
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:59.840]   The iOS version of Srivner which I believe is going to absolutely kick
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:04.040]   But but they're they're taking their time with that making sure that they get it absolutely correct
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:09.240]   So before that gets released, I'm pretty happy with the solution right here
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:15.280]   My pick I picked before but it's a little bit changed now mailbox has eliminated its reservation system
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:21.680]   They put a lot of servers online. This is my opinion the best iPhone email app because you could do things like
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.360]   Slide things off when you're done with them. You could slide them a little bit to archive them
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:33.080]   It works with Gmail you can set a date or time to follow up on this and they've gotten a little bit more granular in the date and time
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:39.360]   Later today this evening tomorrow this weekend, but in the past people who wanted this app and it is a really great app
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.080]   Kind of a to-do list
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.520]   version of your Gmail
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:50.920]   Have had to get in line. They've eliminated that now so you can go and get mailbox right now for your iPhone
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:56.840]   Probably the easiest ways to go to the web mailbox app calm because if you search for mailbox on the app store
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:05.240]   You may find quite a few things that aren't mailbox. I highly recommend it. It's just it's what I use for email now mailbox app calm
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.680]   A really good way to get to a zero. You know you found it like well
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:15.040]   You click the link in the website there you go. That's fantastic just just the just this idea of
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.360]   When you're going through your mailbox all you really want to do especially on your phone is the
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:25.320]   Pay attention to this is something I can ignore forever and you can add through this stuff. I mean it really is nice. Yeah
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.620]   mailbox app calm highly recommended and now no longer
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:34.760]   On hold you can it's nice to be owned by Dropbox. Yeah
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.760]   You guys
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:46.000]   We can handle another new app that launched yesterday called triage and if drop if mailbox is too complicated for you triage
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.400]   Just books all your email in one card stack and then you throw it up to keep it throw it down to archive it
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.520]   Oh, that's good. That's all it does triage on the road
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.400]   Yeah, and you just want to sort incredibly fast mailbox actually lets you respond to email and do all the things
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.440]   You would do it a normal mailbox a mail app, but good all right
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.760]   I'll check that one out this does require Gmail
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.160]   You have to sign it up with a Gmail account. I look forward to seeing it work with other IMAP systems Renee Richie
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.800]   I'm more calm. That's the place to go to keep up on all the Mac news
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:21.760]   Apple news iOS news. He's the greatest and we're so glad we have you every week now nice. Nick a plug-in Leo
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:26.560]   Please do we were lucky enough to get mark kawano on the iterate show last week
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.640]   He was up until recently Apple's user experience evangelist
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   Before that he did Photoshop at Adobe and he did aperture at Apple
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.000]   And now he is working on his own stuff
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.800]   But he just he explained a lot about how that sort of
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:48.160]   Stuff works and what he looks for in apps and how he's I think he has beta tested more apps than anyone in the history of iOS
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.560]   So and you you gave a lot of the sessions at WWDC and at the tech talks
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.360]   It was a very good speaker easy to find the many podcasts that you do there at i'm more calm
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.080]   Just go to i'm more calm and click the podcast link and iterate
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.160]   Is the one where you interview him that sounds great
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.800]   Thank you so much
