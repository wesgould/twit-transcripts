[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.560]   in the dead zone this is the this is the part of
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.240]   The orbit around the earth where you lose all radio contact for 15 minutes because Apple you know in two weeks is gonna
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.320]   Announce something we don't know what Renee Richie is here. He'll probably explain it all to us from i'm more calm
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.960]   He's waiting for the invitation and the anaco is here
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   He's waiting to join us on our coverage of the keynote which I will not be here for nice to see you and
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.360]   From where are you Washington? Where are you home? I'm in DC. Yeah DC. Oh, yeah in the special set that you and Andy were on
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   Did you get the peanut shells out of the carpet?
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.880]   Just barely we had a scrape now Alex Lindsay from the pixel core
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.880]   We could start with something like soft
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.840]   Like Tim Cook's Apple
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.760]   Hmm good article and abuse by yeah, little moose bush very good. Yeah little article by the guy named Renee Richie
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.360]   Did you draw that Tim Cook? I think you did yes. Yeah nicely done. Thank you nicely done
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.200]   all about
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.400]   The fact that seven years ago not today, but a few days ago seven years ago Steve Jobs
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.120]   stepped down effectively and said Tim Cook's gonna run the place Tim was the chief operating officer
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.080]   It's hard to believe it's only been seven years. He really has become identified with the company
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.880]   It's hard to believe considering how big a founder or co-founder Steve Jobs was yeah
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.440]   Yeah, and my dad sent me a nice note the other day saying oh
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.920]   About seven years ago. You said jobs is gone. You should sell your Apple stock. It's a good thing. We didn't
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.360]   Thanks Leo
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   Thanks dad
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.560]   It's a good thing we didn't yeah, cuz I'd never hear the end of it then Tim Cook's done all right in seven years, huh?
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah, I mean he took Apple to a trillion dollars
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.200]   Has he did you look in the numbers has he done more for the stock price than than Steve did on his from his return?
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.320]   I mean it's hard to talk it because it's such different times in such different places
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.040]   I mean an absolute value a trillion dollars is a trillion dollars
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.480]   And it's hard to also parse what jobs did to set up that rocket and how well you know
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.160]   Tim sat on it and wrote it into the stars
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.760]   So I think it's it's definitely a combined effort because jobs did everything to sort of structure the products of the company
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.880]   And then when Steve Jobs, sorry then when Tim Cook came in he sort of structured the company itself
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.720]   And those two things working in tandem. It reminds me of Pixar after Disney bought it
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.200]   You never get the heights of genius or the misses of genius
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.080]   But you get a much more normalized curve and I think Tim Cook's done a really good job writing that
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.720]   The only problem with Pixar is did they ever have it? Did they ever have a failure? I mean they have ever have a failed movie
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.580]   Which should have an incredible beat the irony of Pixar is that when Jobs bought it?
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.260]   He didn't think he was buying a movie company. He thought I was buying a hardware company
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.440]   Yeah, right and nothing to do with Toy Story or anything in fact
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.280]   Steve didn't really want anything to do with Pixar until it was it won an Academy Award and then he said
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.840]   Oh, yeah, I'm responsible here. What who owns what where well he did he did he didn't take them
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.360]   You know he gave George
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   I think it was ten million dollars for Pixar and you know he had and it was kind of a you know
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.520]   He was really interested in that part
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.240]   I mean obviously the Mac had been very graphics oriented and so that was something that he was
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.640]   You know kind of connected to and he really gave the guys free wheel to develop this
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   I mean he knew it was gonna go somewhere. He just didn't know when or how and
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.160]   Tell us what they did because I I don't know if people know this story
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.640]   Oh
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.720]   Yeah, so they you know what how they you know they had the Pixar machine the Pixar machine was the graphics
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.880]   Machine that did did the work
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.480]   You know did the rendering and it actually did compositing and did a bunch of other things and then the and you had Ed
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.560]   Catmall and a handful of other folks that were there figuring this out computer graphics and they wasn't for them though
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.480]   It was for other company they worked it they were owned by Lucasfilm. So oh, that's Lucasfilm
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.760]   So this was part of Lucasfilm. This was like a little group that was in Lucasfilm
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.440]   and I think they used it for the young Sherlock Holmes was the first graphics that they actually produced it was the the the
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.960]   Stanglessy
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.120]   thing last night and so so they did that render and and so they but it was just not catching up and it was like
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.360]   Well, we're not really I don't know when this is gonna turn out
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.640]   We're really using mostly miniatures and and models and that's what we should just focus on and and you know
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.360]   It wasn't progressing fast enough and so George was this is the story
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.000]   I heard George wasn't sure what to do with it and Steve was like why don't I buy it from you and so they
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.920]   Pixar in its official history leaves out Alvey Ray Smith
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.080]   But he was a big part of this we actually I
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.840]   We have some interviews with Alvey Ray Smith. We're gonna put in our new podcast for doing a podcast based on the Valley of Genius book
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.680]   Adam Fisher is very kindly
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.400]   allowed us to do a show with Adam of the tapes of the interviews he did and he interviewed Alvey Ray Smith and I think
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   Alvey was a little bitter because he's essentially been written out of the Pixar history
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.240]   Right, yeah, and I'm not sure of his involvement, you know in in that specifically, but but he
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.640]   But anyway, he was there with it. I mean that was he was right founders
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.400]   Yeah, and there was
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.040]   What would then happen of course was that the they were kind of left to their own devices and what they had to do is they started doing
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.800]   Shorts, that's what that's where he had the Luxo, Jr. What you see at the beginning every every
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.860]   Movie was they started kind of testing little shorts and they still do shorts
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.120]   I mean this is like a cultural thing that went all the way back to the beginning and that was a that was John Lasseter
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.560]   Who they had kind of stolen away from Disney?
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.200]   Well, he wasn't happy there Disney thought you know
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.280]   He had all these ideas of how to use the Peter graphics and Disney thought he was crazy
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.200]   And so they you know he left and came over and then they started doing these little stories
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.400]   And some of the early stuff was you know, it's very rough
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.080]   You know it was amazing at the time
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.880]   But it was it was very rough in the 80s and then Luxo, Jr
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.000]   And they started basically created in 86 to sell the hardware wasn't a business or anything
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.600]   It was a demo. Yeah, but but the guys always had a vision of doing
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.680]   I mean they there was a business model for the hardware there was a business model that was building for RenderMan
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.960]   There were business models that were related to that process, but they
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.680]   But they you know a lot of them had dreams of doing doing stuff as with it as well, you know and and so they they
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.000]   anyway, so the
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.680]   You know and then they were there then they were doing commercials because I mean that still the commercials took a long time to render back
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.040]   Then and that that really cut all their teeth and got them to a point where they could get funding to do Toy Story
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.560]   You know, that's the but it but it was years if you look at that
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.280]   I mean from the it was a what I guess a I want to say a decade
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   or a narrow decade of
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.960]   Messing about
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:39.440]   You know essentially to you know to get to to Toy Story. Yeah, and and what made story great was
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.880]   You know the story, you know, it was it was rendered incredibly well
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.280]   But even when you look at when you look back now at Toy Story at the quality, it's you know, it's
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.080]   At the time it was amazing now when you look at where we're at today. It's it's still it's pretty basic
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.440]   Just jobs who had just been fired from Apple and was you know looking for stuff to do and it was starting next
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:08.160]   Spent five million dollars George Lucas wanted more and
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.760]   Five I heard it was ten, but it was at five million it could have been
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.200]   Well, here's how it was ten. So this is according to Wikipedia
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:25.600]   Jobs who'd recently been fired for Apple was now CEO of next paid five million dollars of his own money to George Lucas for technology rights
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.800]   And the Lucas wanted more, but he couldn't find him he was to buy it
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.380]   And invested five million is capital into the company. So it costs Steve a total of ten
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.860]   Right and boy that was a good
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:44.480]   Disney for more than ten million dollars when he when he
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.120]   When he started when he started next I heard this I heard this story that that when he started next he went to
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.160]   Cray and he actually went he's the only person that's ever gone to
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.920]   the cray headquarters to or to buy a cray computer and he
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.560]   Someone told Seymour cray that he was in the Steve Jobs isn't the lobby wants to buy a by a cray
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.400]   And he said why does he want to buy a cray?
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.720]   You know like it he was like, you know started Apple
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.600]   I don't understand and the guy said because he wants to design his next computer on on a cray
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   Wow and see more said well, that's pretty funny because I designed the cray on a Mac
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:36.160]   Andy you wanted to say something. I'm sorry. We were no. No, I'm just saying I was just gonna ask wasn't it the
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.880]   Lucas's sale also kind of predicated by the fact that he was going through a divorce. I need a cash the cash
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.880]   Yeah, that's exactly right
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.080]   eventually that ten million dollar investment
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.080]   ten years later was
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:58.320]   Turned into a sale to Disney for 7.4 billion in Disney stock making the jobs family the number one Disney stockholder
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.760]   More than 10%
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.040]   Yeah, seven percent. That's right largest shareholder. Yeah
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.360]   Nice nice work it, but we all we started this with Tim Cook. What was his involvement at Pixar?
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.800]   Maybe he helped direct the sales people who sold him a few Macs over
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:24.760]   Maybe I think the sales team is an ops. When did he come to when did he come to Apple and how how did that get the year?
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.600]   But he was a compact and yeah came to Apple to run
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.640]   I you'd done a really well with supply chain and Tim Cook's the kind of guy who would you know
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.960]   Pre-buy all the capacity for shipping product from China and then Dela would show up three days before they need it and go
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.280]   What do you mean? There's no planes? He really revolutionized what I was already a revolution in computer logistics
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:53.800]   Yeah, it was one of the that's one of the reasons one of the many reasons why you don't find like Macs and other like Apple products on discount is
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.080]   Because they get that
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:05.160]   Calculated to such precision and they get that they get that manufacturing line running so smoothly that they almost build to they almost build to need
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.520]   They don't they they're not in the position
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.560]   They used to be in or what a lot of companies are still in right now where they have to make a bad guess and then make way more than they could
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.160]   Possibly need or make way less than they can sell and either be stuck with too much inventory
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.460]   Or be stuck with people who are now going to go buy one of 14 alternatives to whatever Dell or whatever HP or whatever
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.040]   late
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   Just-in-time
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.640]   manufacturing right yeah, yeah, yeah, uh cook was actually after after leaving Auburn
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.040]   Because he's a big war eagle go war Eagle
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:45.520]   He spent 12 years at IBM in the in the PC business director eventually of North American fulfillment
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   got an MBA from Duke
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:55.320]   Was briefly he was only a comic for six months. He tells the story of how he got hired
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.400]   This was in a commencement speech at Auburn and he purely rational. I love this is very Tim Cook
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:12.200]   This any this is Tim Cook any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in compact's favor and the people who knew me best
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.600]   advised me to stay at compact on that day in early 1998 I
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.720]   Listen to my intuition not the left side of my brainer for that matter even the people who knew me best
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.160]   No more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.320]   I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. That's how good a salesman Steve is
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.840]   Do you want to sell beige boxes all your life?
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:39.440]   My intuition already knew that joining Apple was once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.960]   Be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company. This is jobs on his return
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.620]   To Apple, you know we I wanted to do a series of interviews
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.160]   How Steve hired me?
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.560]   Oh, because we just talked to Bill Atkinson, you know, we did a two-part triangulation with Bill Atkinson
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.600]   Who you know was responsible for quick draw on much of the Lisa operating system?
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:10.240]   McPaint on the Mac hypercard later magic link magic link magic link magic cap magic cap
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.640]   and Bill said
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.280]   Steve this was when Apple is a 30 people and and Bill Atkinson was a neuroscientist
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.840]   working on his PhD
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.200]   in Washington state and
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.160]   Jeff Raskin who he'd worked with briefly said you got to come down and see we're doing at Apple so
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.840]   You know Bill said I'm this close to a doctorate. I've been 11 years getting this. I'm gonna finish my doctor
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.240]   I'm not interested. He said look. I'll pay your plane ticket Raskin said no obligation no strings just come down
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.840]   Steve jobs spent a whole day with him. He says I don't know what Steve saw in me
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.520]   But for whatever reason Steve spent the whole day with me and he said the thing that convinced me
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   Was he said you know the technology you use today is two years old was invented two years ago?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.640]   You want to use you want to start seeing what's gonna come two years from now?
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.560]   You need to come work here. He said it's the difference between surfing at the front edge of the wave and dog
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   Paddling behind the wave don't you want to surf the front edge of the wave and that can sit said yep
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.560]   That's it
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:19.680]   No PhD from a same thing basically as Tim Cook like whatever it was that magic does that Steve jobs sprinkled I
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.480]   would love to do a series of
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.760]   Interviews with people how to how to take fire and of course you're referring Rene Richard the famous quote
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.360]   The when he hired John Scully same thing he walked around the campus
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:39.080]   Heringed him all day brings him up on the roof of Apple and and you know says look out here at Silicon Valley now
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.640]   Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want to change the kids or do you want to change the world?
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.280]   You know the one thing that every meeting that I've heard of that
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.320]   You know people talk about Steve being in you know selling
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.800]   He one of the things it seems like he's really good at is it is cell his cell tactic seems to be
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.520]   Do you want to stay in the crappy place that you are or come with me?
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   It was never like it's this is all great and you're doing great too or
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.320]   It's you know, it's all it's always there was a little bit of you know gaslighted, you know
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.560]   Just like you're in a horrible place and I can I can help you take this work
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.920]   This war so Atkinson tells the second half of that
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.640]   Steve has been fired
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.720]   He's starting next Bill Atkinson's writing hypercard
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:32.200]   Steve says you got to come with me. You can't stay at this crap. She's in this crap shack with Scully come to me
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.040]   We're gonna change the world at next and this time Atkins said and I said no
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:42.960]   I'm gonna finish hypercard bill Steve says well if you were my friend if you were really my friend you'd come with me to next and
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.320]   Atkins and says well if you were really my friend you'd let me finish hypercard and he said we didn't talk to
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.520]   We didn't talk for years after that
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.840]   Yeah, oh isn't that it so it doesn't always work
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:02.120]   Right anyway Tim Cook we were saying I'm sorry. We really get way down memory lane on this
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.840]   Tell us tell us about your article
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:12.600]   So it's just they're very both they're both very products of Apple Steve jobs built Apple and Tim Cook really became Apple
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.120]   But they go about similar things in very different ways
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.320]   I think one of the most profound ways is that Apple always did you know charity work and Apple always did a bunch of things to try to
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.720]   To to make their employees better to make the world better
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.920]   But Steve Jobs always believed in never pimping your karma. You don't talk about it. It's not dignified to talk about it
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   We're Tim Cook who's a big fan of Martin Luther King. He tweeted about it today of Robert Kennedy, Jr. All of us of Robert Kennedy
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.760]   Sorry
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.960]   He believes that you have to pave that golden path and you can inspire others by what you do
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.400]   And he's really taken Apple in a direction where they are very public about their relief efforts their charitable efforts
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.600]   They're matching donations and about civil rights civil liberties equal opportunity all of those things. He's become
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.880]   And some people really don't like this aspect of him and other people think it's the absolute best aspect of him
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.320]   But he has become a champion not just for Apple but for Apple's ability to to influence and help shape the world
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:11.200]   Well and very famously the first big company CEO to come out. Yeah
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.160]   In his own editorial - yeah, he's yeah, he wasn't he wasn't outed
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.360]   He was on his terms on his terms and bravo, right?
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.560]   Absolutely. Yeah, and I think
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.040]   And I get the impression that he did that for
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:33.120]   Other gays that are that at the time it was a very hard time, you know for the gay population
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:39.680]   So I think that that when he came out it was really in support of them more than something he needed to do. Yeah
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.760]   No, I got that sense too. It was kind of a crisis
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.480]   Time there were a lot of hate crimes
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.520]   Right, I think he was part of the gets better movement. I think yeah
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.960]   I got that sense too that he he's very private. He didn't want to talk about it
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   But he felt like you know what I have to at this point. I have to say something
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:07.600]   Yeah, you were from he had felt a tremendous responsibility quote unquote to come out as gay. Yeah
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.640]   So has he been here's the real question. I think apple fans and lovers and haters ask
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.960]   Has he been a good successor to jobs particularly in the vision thing?
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.800]   He doesn't want jobs was one dimensional is like job is an amazing product visionary
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.040]   But he didn't actually make the products he had to depend on a wide variety of people from johnny
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   I have to help him design them to tim cookly that old statement about yet
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.120]   You know steve jobs helped dream up the ipad
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.400]   But tim cook is a reason why it sells for $500. He had all these people from phil Shiller to eddy q
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:46.160]   To bob man's field helping and supporting him tim cook doesn't do what steve jobs did
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.040]   But steve jobs didn't do what tim cook did tim cook had to assemble around him existing and new people
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.800]   Who would help him be as well around that as steve jobs was each in their own niche
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.320]   I think in a lot of ways it sets apple up for the growth that it's had
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.760]   I think apple wouldn't be where it was if steve didn't get it there with the innovation with the hard push with the vision
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.880]   But for it and this is very typical for companies is that you you start at a
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.160]   You know the the innovator
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.760]   Pushes it to some certain degree, but then you need someone who's going to manage that growth
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.600]   You know past that and I so I think that that that handoff
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.320]   I think he's doing a lot of things that steve wouldn't have done
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.520]   And I think that all of those things are things that are helping helping the company grow
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.600]   You know and it's amazing when you think about apple's value in the last week or whatever has gone up or maybe the last two weeks
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.680]   $5 billion. I mean that's a really good business
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.600]   It's like and
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:50.800]   Billion now billion now is represented on the on the stock market as 0.05. Yeah, you know like 5 billion is 0.05
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.040]   It's 1.05 trillion
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   But then in a way if you were going to say
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.480]   What the differences were between jobs and cook it would be exactly that right the jobs came up with
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.760]   New products that really inspired some of them were hits most of them were hit some of them were flops
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.480]   And that cook has really been a good custodian
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.840]   By taking what steve did and making it
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.160]   You know better
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.360]   Faster, but but incrementally but also like air pods. I think air pods is probably one of the better products apples done
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.360]   Including recent jobs era products. It may not be as consistent and it may be like I said normalized
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.200]   But there are still some fundamentally great technologies coming out of apple. Yeah
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.160]   This is uh, this is the the stock graph my dad sent me
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:44.640]   Said right about here. You said oh yet, uh, tim cook's taken over you should get rid of that apple stock right about there and then
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.720]   I should I should just say yeah, you're right then of course
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.120]   One hurts you like family leo. Well, I never I've never owned apple stock. I'm not except
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.680]   I guess it's I suppose it's in some of my index funds, but I you know, I'm not paying attention
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:06.320]   Well, but look it wasn't stupid advice. Look at that graph if he had sold and he could have sold at that peak
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   Uh, excuse me sold at that peak
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.600]   Knowing that there's going to be a drop then buy it back
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.880]   At a discount and then kept that's what I meant
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   That's what I meant
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.880]   Oh well
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:29.920]   How is now tim is what he's uh, he's a little younger than me. So he's 56 57. Oh my god. Yeah, um
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.320]   I mean, you know, he's he's gonna be around a little longer. Are they do is apple at all thinking about his replacement?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.640]   I mean you look at some of the lists people put out and it's basically everybody on the executive page
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.800]   So I think I believe his original agreement with apple was for 10 years and that takes him to 2021
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.840]   Um, and he might well want to keep doing it
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.920]   He looks like someone who loves what he does and believes that they really can't affect change on a global scale
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.200]   And that's a very unique position. Sorry very unique doesn't exist. That's a unique position
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.760]   To be in man. You're a writer. I'm
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.240]   No, he's no he's an editor. He's an editor even more important
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.000]   And
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.680]   That was very few people who can do that and you look at apple and they have to be prepared
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.560]   You never know what's gonna happen today tomorrow in the future. Um, I remember this is a ludicrous story
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.720]   But I'm gonna tell it I arrived at the airport and I got in an uber and the the person driving said are you here for the apple event?
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.920]   And I said yeah, and they said well I used to work for tim cook like really?
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.240]   Yeah, I reported directly to tim cook for years, but then apple moved manufacturing to china. So
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.320]   I decided to retire I got bored so now i'm driving an uber
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   And they proceeded to tell me all these stories
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.440]   But they're like I remember when steve jobs made tim cook go spend time in marketing and he's like you're gonna run this company one day
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.160]   You have to spend time in marketing. He's like, I don't want to I like my numbers
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.520]   He's like no you have to learn the complete business that interesting
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:52.640]   Yeah, and I think you see that now like like jeff williams is running apple watch and that means he has to understand apple from a complete product
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:24:00.160]   point of view and he's you know a legitimate successor of apple and angel aran is turning apple store into a product and they're talking about
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.880]   They're discussing it like it's a product and she has to learn how all those aspects and she's another legitimate contender
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.280]   So I think they go through those grooming processes and it's his obligation to the board of directors
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.840]   To make sure there is a line of succession if anything were to you know any tragedy were to strike
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.120]   But you know, I think if he had his dr others he'd be there for a while yet
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.520]   It's no surprise. He said that he didn't like marketing
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.760]   If there's one thing that you don't think of tim cook in is marketing you think of him a numbers guy ops guy
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.280]   Well, they said that they would give him numbers from spreadsheets. He said no that's incorrect the number you gave me three months ago was this instead
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.360]   From his memory. Of course
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.280]   But I don't mind that i'm not i'm not a marketing. I don't like marketing either
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   So I i'm not I think that's fine
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:45.840]   Uh, and he does have johnny. I've although you get the feeling johnny's not that involved these days and day-to-day operations
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.400]   You have any sense of that at all? Yes, people still present
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   I still know people who got a present to him and they still got a present to johnny
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.320]   And you look at things like like you know, there's stories about him going over the pro-mation
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.960]   The pro-motion display and the ipads over and over again. Okay, worrying about apple pencil
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.720]   Changing the the changing the material of the pin at the last the pen at the last minute and all those sort of things
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.000]   It's kind of interesting. I didn't realize this but they got a design patent for the steve jobs theater
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:21.280]   The exterior is patented. This is this is recent just happened. It's for the above ground glass building
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:28.480]   Uh the patent let me see if I can find the this is from patently apple. Let me see if i can find the language of the patent
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.200]   actually got 67 patents
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.840]   on august 28 that's today
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.760]   covering the theater quantum dot technology and 3d sensing for the uh
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.920]   True depth camera. Wow, but this is this is the patent image
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.160]   For the steve jobs theor. Oh, maybe it has to do with that carbon fiber roof, right?
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:53.680]   Well, I mean that that's that's well and good and all but I mean what what protection does a patent actually deliver?
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.280]   Because you know that you know that like one of the first four of those things
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.600]   Is going to be it's going to be bought by by someone in china
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.360]   Is they're going to make their own patterns make their own tooling and then start punching out these app these seep jobs theaters
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.800]   You'll be able to buy at a target for like 18 dollars all over the place
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:19.440]   Uh, I love it. Well, anyway, happy happy 7th anniversary, uh, tim and I guess we owe him a thank you
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.680]   I mean you point out in your article there are a few things that a few areas where tim
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.160]   uh under tim's
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.600]   Guidance apple has not done so well and we don't have to be labor those but uh,
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.680]   It's just scaling is hard. I mean the the scale of apple is so much bigger now than it's ever been and you really it's the same kind of team
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   So something has to give and no no it's fair. He's 100% you know as it bats a thousand. That's not you know, it's not doable
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.920]   Yeah, also I mean look look at the difference like like rene says the difference between apple then and apple now
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.560]   right now apple
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.680]   steve was not running apple at a time where a tech company could have the power of a nation state
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.520]   And now that's the situation with apple and google and facebook
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.920]   Uh and apple now has the ability they're not just a hardware maker. They can project influence and project power
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.160]   uh, and uh
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.080]   And now they're in a position where they really you really can't have a ceo that has the sort of reputation
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.600]   Of unpredictability as as steve had
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.000]   Um, like look at what's happening with with elon musk these days where there's a lot of lack of confidence based on the fact that he's doing
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.680]   He's basically being a very passionate very expressive individual whereas tim cook is a person who will
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:41.520]   Absolutely cut you man just by simply leading back in his chair and folding his arms and person his lips slightly
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.880]   And looking at you until you just want to die
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.120]   And that's how that's how that's his version of uh of of being
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.680]   Of going into attack mode. He is the person that can is calm. He's smooth. He's the person that can
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.120]   Do things like again, not only come out as a as a gay man, but also
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   Make sure that that's done in such a way that uh, the importance of that move is
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.680]   Is well expressed and well taken. Uh, he's the person that can uh
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.400]   protest
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   uh immigration laws
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.560]   Change than immigration laws without seeming like he's just flying off the handle and going on a twitter rant
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.800]   Uh, and so that's the sort of person that needs to be in the ceo chair when apple reaches this kind of state
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.160]   And he's only 57. He's he stays healthy
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.880]   They could I mean you talk about 75 before you start to
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.200]   Maybe ask grandpa to retake his driving test just in case
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.360]   Uh, and he's not the sort of person who's going to get ants in his pants. That's the the only thing that's I don't think it's a
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.920]   problem, but the only thing that is
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.920]   Uh, an interesting point of debate is how many people how many vice presidents are willing to wait
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.960]   Five years 10 years 15 years without wanting to say well, I want to
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.360]   Basically, I I want the ability to steer my own company and design and uh, and make my
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.160]   Vision of what a company should be what it should do and what its responsibilities are
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.000]   I want to be that kind of creator. I don't want to be the person who simply has a
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:21.200]   You always have conversations with somebody who's actually the head person. So that's it retention is going to be interesting
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.520]   uh beyond the
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.280]   legendary
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.480]   Uh, the the people who have always been at the core of apple for the past 10 years
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.000]   How are the new people going to get along? Are they going to feel like they got a shot at the moon landing or are they feel like
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.920]   They're being pushed over to or maybe you're going to do like a space station in 1975
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.560]   76 77 what you hang around just in case we do that it's interesting you mentioned the uh
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:52.160]   Elon musk's uh troubles one of the things apple under cook seems to be doing is stepping up its self-driving car
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.800]   project project titan
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.760]   and uh
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.000]   According to apple and sider they've stepped up their poaching activities
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.640]   Taking more tesla employees over the last few months
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.560]   Not just in self-driving cars a lot of them though are going to project titan
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.160]   You got to think a lot of people are rethinking their commitment to tesla given
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.000]   Uh, it's an opportunity
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.480]   Uh, but they're founder based companies and a lot of called personality and those and you want to go to a place where you think you're
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.720]   Going to make the next product that changes the world and when you start to think that maybe that's not where you're
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   You know, that's not what their company's added. You start looking for your options
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.720]   I love the but in addition to that apple is well
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:37.680]   For for a project that is as speculative as self-driving cars and as much as we love those little tech demos
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.000]   They are we are I don't think that they're anywhere near
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.600]   Delivering what we think they're gonna supposed they're supposed to deliver apple is sitting on so much money
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.800]   They can keep bankroll if you if you if you sign on to uh apple self-driving self-driving
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:57.040]   Project you know that they've got enough money that so long as apple maintains and interests in developing this you got a job
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.560]   and you can keep
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   experimenting and developing and
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.040]   And finding encountering a movable objects and finding a way to battle through them
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.720]   While not actually having a product that's making any money for anybody
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.440]   Whereas tesla is in a position where they don't have anywhere near the war chest of apple
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.160]   They don't have the ability to keep something flying if it's not making money and now they're
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.480]   They're they're because they're actually selling cars
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.560]   They have the responsibility of manufacturing all the cars that are being bought and making sure that they get into the supply line
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.640]   It's really wonderful to be able to be in the position of designing and
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.400]   Making your money off of just clouds of air, which is what apples car people get to do
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.480]   Uh, it's whereas if you work for tesla, you're going to get like a fraction of the money and you're going to be asked
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:52.400]   Why is it that when it rained and someone has someone encountered a stoplight that was a little too orange instead of green
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.760]   It did the wrong thing and still make money for the company
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.600]   And it's like palm and blackberry didn't have ancillary businesses but sam song and michasoth and apple could use their
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.280]   Computer and appliance and office business to fund the next generation of products
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.240]   Yeah, and I think that also I think that the
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.800]   The tesla production pipeline seems a little bit more off the cuff
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   Than the uh, than the apple production
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.920]   I'm apple has its own a tesla denies that more people are leaving
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:27.360]   For apple than before and they've often called apple the tesla graveyard that the employees that apple stealing from tesla are the ones
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.760]   They didn't want anyway
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.880]   So I don't know what the I don't know what the you know tesla disagrees
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:40.240]   But I think you're right for all those reasons what I find the reason I think it's an interesting data point is not a commentary on tesla but more
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.720]   the apple seems to be back
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.920]   Working hard on project titan. I mean for a while
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.280]   Around right everyone was leaving apple for tesla for a while yeah for a while because apple said well
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.960]   Yeah, we're not we're not gonna do a self-driving car. Are they now doing a self-driving car?
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.160]   What is going on?
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.360]   They were never not doing a self-driving car what apple what happens is you always have an executive sponsor on a product
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.840]   There's a special projects group and they do a bunch of different things
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.760]   They have AR projects and self-driving car projects and projects that aren't really public yet
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.960]   And they have an executive who sort of oversees those and presents
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.840]   You know they present up the chain until they get a green light or a red light and it's this whole complicated thing
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:21.120]   But dan rishio was in charge of project titan and there were a lot of people involved
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.640]   And they had a lot of very big ideas and some of the ideas they had you know
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.400]   That could have been transformed up. I really believe they could have been the next generation of computing
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   But that was beyond the scope of the project and when that starts to happen
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.360]   Maybe you you have a chance of getting the future
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.440]   But you start to lose the present and so apple in one of their reviews and they have reviews all the time decided that they had to refactor
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.760]   The project and dan rishio stepped aside because he's got they're all way over work
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.560]   He's got the mac and all the hardware engineering and everything he's working on
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.440]   And and bob mass almost called him big bob, but bob mass fields came back
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   You know he's he's been
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.880]   He left apple to spend more time with his money
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.120]   So you and his family could spend more time with his money
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.840]   But he's always been coming back and forth to consult and he came on
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.560]   Sort of stripped titan down to its bones again and to get to the most important essential things
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:13.280]   And instead of starting to make everything over from whole cloth they brought on people like
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   um, i'm blanking on his last name dan from q and x dan daj
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   Dan daj from q and x and he's now running software there
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.720]   And uh, you know they they have a bunch of people who are running hardware now, dog field is another one of them
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:33.680]   And they're really bringing it back to autonomous technology and the exploration of production vehicles. So it sort of had a reset
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.960]   But there's there's so much involved and we're seeing that when you when you look at what's happening with ar kit
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:46.000]   In order to have autonomous technology it has to ingest and understand images and we get to benefit with from that with ar kit right now
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.160]   But in the long haul it's like to and he's pulling it's got to understand what's a wall and what's rain
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.600]   You know, so, um, those are incredibly complicated computing projects and machine learning projects and AI projects
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.000]   And we'll get sort of the ancillary technologies for a while and then if apple can productize it
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.040]   That's great. If they can't like joins the television set in the lab
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.920]   Very expensive lab, but apple's got billions of dollars
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:14.160]   Yes, so somewhere somewhere someone that is someone in their house has at apple has a 36 inch tv that costs 1.8 million dollars
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.560]   So hopefully it's a very great
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.400]   Hopefully hopefully they're enjoying it, but yeah, but yeah, it's uh, what i thought was really interesting about
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.600]   These reports is that they're not just it makes absolute sense for apple to be poaching
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.880]   People who are working in the AI parts of it the the vision part of it the processing parts of it
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.200]   uh, all the stuff that can be
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.720]   That can be it's basic research that can be applied to almost anything that apple's trying to do
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.040]   I thought it was interesting though that they're also poaching people who are into auto manufacturing
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.960]   Because it does right now it doesn't seem at all
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.840]   Assured that if you want to make a killing and autonomous car technology that you want to actually make cars that
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.760]   What you would actually want to do is let forward and gm make cars and sell them the software sell them the
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.360]   I mean with with johnny. I've if they're if you're telling if you're telling them that you're we're going to be selling
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.240]   Boxes that are going to be installed inside like engine bays that will never be seen
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.080]   Are they still going to make it like well?
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.000]   We've got this new shade of ultra green and we have this notch in it that that also has an aqua marine
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.840]   For you to it, but yeah, yeah, it's it's going to be inside an engine compartment
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.680]   So yeah, but it's uh, are you going to build an entire car?
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   Are you going to get an entire car certified or are you just going to be selling people?
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.040]   Electrons electrons are a lot there a lot of them out there
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:39.040]   There's one school for cars that have to do this hardware and software tesla's always said this you have to do it all
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:46.720]   You can't do effective software if you're not making the hardware to that point to yoda just to invest in half a billion dollars in uber
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:53.520]   Uh giving it a market valuation by the way of 72 billion. That's not because of the i'd share that's because of self-driving cars
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.720]   I'm sure you could imagine the apple shuttles being autonomous before like an apple car service comes out for example
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.560]   I yeah, I don't think that apple. I think part of what the reset was
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.680]   Um with no insider information or anything else
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.120]   I just think part of the reset was are people really going to be driving the car
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.640]   So when they if you're going to create something for the future and you're building it in 20 23 or 2025
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.480]   um, the more I think about autonomous cars and the more I sit in the back of
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.440]   You know, ubers and lifts and everything else the the more I think that the future is not going to be
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.000]   If you're building something that's not coming out until 2025 you're going to build it without a steering wheel
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.840]   Like you're you're going to tell people what they're you're going to get in and you're going you might still own it
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.520]   But you're not interested. No, that's what kugel has been saying all along. Yep
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.120]   Yep, they're right
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:43.440]   But but it's super difficult. There's a I don't know if any of you read that really great article about waymo
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.280]   Uh, the test the testing they're doing it open rose in uh in our zone right now
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.000]   Uh by the info post on the information.com
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.640]   But they're they're really getting it. They're really it really does a great job of explaining the problems of
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.480]   You're you've got it. We've got this thing working on the google campus
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.520]   That's awesome. But once you put it in a when you put it like in the in the in the
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.760]   Lions and the tigers of actual traffic you realize that how complicated the process of driving a car is and one of the most
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.280]   uh, one of the most important passages was taught was uh
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:24.080]   Making us remember how much when we're behind the wheel of the car so many of our decisions are based on experience and intuition
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.120]   Uh the ability to say that I that guy
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.160]   How many times have I avoided an accent for myself and other people by saying okay
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.360]   That guy in the Mustang is an absolute
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.800]   Jack whatever
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.840]   He's she's he's an idiot. He's he's he's not he's he's an unsafe driver
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:51.600]   If I he's going to need like a big like eight car length space to leap into when he realizes he's about to stop
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.800]   He's about to uh crash into a truck that's stopping short in front of him
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.080]   So i'm going to open up a big gap in front of me and sure enough at some point he leans
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.760]   A truck taps his brakes a little bit. He has to leap into safety
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:11.440]   And it's the ability to uh as one of the examples I put into there is the ability to look at pedestrians waiting on the side of the street
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.040]   And saying okay here is uh like a middle aged couple and here are four teenagers
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:23.680]   And you're in intuiting that the teenagers are more likely to jaywalk than the couple is and factoring that in your decision making
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.600]   So that that's why that's why i'm saying that we're everyone i've talked to about autonomous vehicles
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:34.560]   Underscores that this is this is so far away from doing if we're expecting a car to go on
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.040]   Go on the road and do everything that a that a driver does with the same a measure of safety
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.880]   We're still so far away and we're we really need a big big leap before we can actually crack that
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.280]   Never mind. I think that
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.840]   I think that yeah number one is I still think the easy the easy solution is to the first solution is to move to uh
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.880]   um
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.760]   You used to move to highways, you know, like that's where you really don't want to drive
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.000]   Is just you know, I know waymo works on the other side of that
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.160]   But but when you get on the highway you get into a car
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.320]   You know, that's a much more predictable
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:14.240]   Environment and I do think the offset between all those intuitive things that we do or the fact that we're talking on our phone
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.040]   Even if it's hands-free while we're eating a big mac and you know thinking about other things
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.800]   Um, you know, there's a lot of I think that the autonomous cars
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.920]   You know and and Warren Buffett's already talked about the fact that
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.760]   You know one of the risk factors that he's talking about in the future is
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.920]   Specifically that um, he's concerned that geico will make less money because of autumn, you know
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.320]   Because of this auto driving cars because they're gonna be a lot safer. I mean they really are I mean when we start looking at how crazy
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.960]   Humans are at driving
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.440]   the uh paragraph from uh
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.040]   Amira friday's art article today about waymo's big ambitions
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.920]   slowed by tech trouble you tell me if this is
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.720]   tech trouble or human trouble
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.520]   Two weeks ago lisa hargis
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:05.680]   An administrative assistant who works in an office a stones throw away from waymo's vehicle depot said she nearly hit a waymo
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.600]   Chrysler pacifica minivan
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.720]   Because it stopped abruptly while making a right turn at the intersection
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   Go she shouted angrily she said after getting stuck in the intersection midway through her left turn cars have been driving behind the waymo van also stopped
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.880]   I was gonna murder someone she said
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   Yeah, human error
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.840]   Or like waymo error
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:31.760]   So I again psychology is gonna factor into this so one of the one of the quote problems unquote is that uh waymo
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.400]   Waymo vans they when they when there's a stop sign they stop for three seconds
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.960]   And most people are like well so long as I slow down so long as I tap the brakes while cruising through this intersection
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.080]   That's fine
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   And so people get very annoyed by that and you're gonna have a problem where when people recognize that the car in front of them is an autonomous vehicle
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:56.880]   Is or specifically it's a waymo car. They're gonna think oh my every single prejudice they might have against
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.440]   Against elderly drivers. It's gonna say well
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.840]   I'm that I'm going to just simply go
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.800]   Cross the cross the double yellow line go around it and take my right turn around this car
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.320]   Because partly because I know that I don't want to be stuck behind this waymo car
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.080]   But also because I know that the waymo the waymo software is such a wimp
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.920]   That what's it's gonna all it's gonna do is it's gonna put on its own brakes and let me go around it to prevent a crash from happening
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.680]   And and part of the psychology is knowing that you are not
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   You are not having combat with another human driver you are
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.360]   You are
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.240]   Gaming the system and putting one over on a machine
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   So we're there's a lot of this we're not going to find out about until we have hundreds of thousands of
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   Autonomous vehicles on the road. We're going to have to look at the first 1000 terrible accidents very very carefully before we figure out
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.280]   How to actually make this into a real product
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.360]   Let's take a break because we've been avoiding really the the topic of course of
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.200]   The apple event and all that stuff. We'll get to that
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.240]   Does an apple event?
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.960]   What?
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.760]   Get to that in a second. I'm just what I'm hoping if I take a long enough time you'll get your invitation and then we can
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.280]   Save with certainty when the event is I showed it a brought to you by literally cash fly
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:16.560]   We uh, we uh all of our audio all of our video when you download it comes to you from cash fly petabytes of data every month literally
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   And never a hitch right when you when you subscribe to our podcast they just appear on your phone. They just appear
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.880]   Automatically, it's all coming from cash fly. It's a contact delivery network a CDN
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.760]   And if you use a CDN
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:38.560]   You know that the 3 a.m. Frantic comb phone calls that your CDN is out are not a good thing
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   And every and if the tech support is unreliable every second your site is down as money lost on your watch
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:53.280]   You need a CDN that works. You need cash fly cash fly has been building trusted CDN relationships since 2002
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.120]   We've been using them since 2005 or 6 I want to say
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:04.080]   No more outages 100 availability with their bulletproof 100 sla
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:09.120]   And a great team we talked to him often of smart easy to talk to agile techs
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.800]   And they can answer your question. I love this without having to pass you around they they can answer it the first time
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:23.200]   If you're in software if you're a podcaster any other business that relies on having data readily available to your customers
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.320]   You don't know what your bandwidth consumption is going to be
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:35.440]   Uh, and it's frustrating when a company will lock you into a contract that's not flexible not built around your unique patterns of uh, demand and traffic
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.840]   Make this the last month your CDN bill gives you a headache say goodbye
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.800]   to logging in every day
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.480]   Trying to track your usage so you know what the bill is going to be at the end of the month
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.920]   On average customers who switch to cash fly save more than 20
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.840]   Percent we honestly twit wouldn't exist if it weren't for cash fly. We couldn't afford
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.400]   Those other guys just imagine what you could do with that 20 percent with your time
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.200]   When you don't have to micromanage your usage or worry about having to commit to a long-term contract
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.360]   Don't buy CDNs that way go to cash fly. They're reliable network. They're great prices
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.880]   We rely on them. We have for more than a decade you should too and we have a special offer for you
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:22.080]   Cash fly is giving away a complimentary detail analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends let them take a look at it
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.760]   And tell you if they can save you 20 percent or more
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.400]   Why leave it on the table go to twit.com
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.640]   And learn more twit.com
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.760]   Thank you cash flight
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.560]   We've used them for a long time as well and yeah, and uh
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:45.120]   It's hard to crash them in fact. It's impossible like I've had I did get a call from at one time said you're moving a gig a second
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.520]   Matt levine is one of the founders and he's he's been our champion
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.200]   He came to me must be 2005 2006
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:00.640]   And said we'd like to host your content and and and you know what it was just audio then and then a few years later. We say um matt
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.320]   We'd like to also offer gigabyte sized
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.400]   Video files that and he said no problem. He's always been great. Uh, it's been great
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.520]   Really love cash fly and on it in all honesty this would not exist if it weren't for cash fly
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:21.440]   So if you if you're looking for a CDN do them a favor dude because they did us a big favor cash fly twit.com
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.280]   All right enough enough we're gonna talk about
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.040]   Ming chi quote he's backing down on the apple pencil rumor
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.880]   No, no pencil support for 2018 iPhones. He's he's let us down. He
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.480]   Transforce
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.600]   Fighting
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.640]   Transforce said the rumor that I couldn't tell if the china daily was just regurgitating it or corroborating it
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.560]   And i'm being Ming chi quote says no no stop it both of you
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.720]   He also says and I don't know if this is something to worry about that the
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.360]   Point one inch model. That's the little cheap one. No, it won't be cheap
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:06.560]   But a little less expensive one has been reportedly plagued by production issues and will be available slightly later due to its production schedule
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.160]   We heard that
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.320]   About the iPhone 10 and it didn't really come true, right? iPhone 10 shipped on November 2nd. Oh, okay. So it was a little later
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.920]   Yeah, I mean they announced it up front. It wasn't like they said oh, it's coming today and ooh, sorry, right
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.800]   Uh, there'll be the I think we all kind of know
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.320]   Roughly the outline of what apple will be talking about
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.160]   Probably september 12th. We've gone through that calendaring
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:38.640]   Thing and there's there are there continue to be data points bolstering that a german telecom that said you'll be able to order your iphone
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.720]   September 14th and another one that said deliveries begin september 21st
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:48.960]   And so I think there's you know corroborating evidence that it'll be september 12th for the announcement three phones
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.280]   The 6.1 inch lcd the less expensive phone basically an iphone eight
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.960]   Some rumors say iphone not they'll call it iphone nine. I don't know
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:03.360]   Uh, I think the latest from german is may hold on on that iphone 10s or excess
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.120]   Which is I mean it's easy. I mean it's it's hard to predict because apple literally has a name
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.080]   They think about they put it on a list and they think of 300 other names
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.000]   They try to see if any of those names are better if they're not they stick with the one they first thought if they are better
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.840]   They switch to them. There's a persistent rumor that the macbook was going to be called the macbook stealth
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.320]   And they decided no, that's just silly and went with macbook
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   You can see it
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:30.480]   As long as you as long as you can make the box in time they can make anything. Yeah, I mean what does it matter what it's called
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:35.120]   But that's one mother of dragons partly because there's not a lot to be said about the rest of it
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.320]   We know two oleds 6.5 inches and 5.8 inches
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.560]   Basically an iphone eight
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.720]   Next generation that'll be an lcd an iphone 10 next generation
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.840]   Very similar to the iphone 10 and then a supersized
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.240]   10 plus that'll be 6.5 inches. What impresses me is like apple display
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.280]   They don't get enough credit like a lot of people just say oh, it's you know Samsung made the molyt panels
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.080]   But apple
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   They went to all the work of bending it backwards and plugging it in so you'd get rid of the chin of the phone
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.640]   And most companies now are doing like these massive notches
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.400]   But still putting the chin on the phone and apple's about to release an led phone
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:12.160]   That now bends backwards and gets rid of the chin just like from a hardware engineering point of view
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.640]   Especially an apple display team point of view. They're doing fascinating work with all of these pixels
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.680]   Yeah, but that's uh, I'm I'm still kind of ambivalent about the the the the the the cheeks
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   The the chins and the and all these other things
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.280]   some points
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.360]   I mean at at some point you need to you're not worried about
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:38.000]   finger tuffs finger touches interfering with the sides of the phone because they have rejection algorithms for that
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.800]   But at some point you have to how are you going to
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.200]   At sometimes you find yourself
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.400]   I find myself sort of like juggling this phone somewhere around my hand because my finger
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:54.480]   My the edge of the of the screen is invisible because my the pad of my thumb is a little bit too close to the edge of the screen
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.040]   It's kind of nice to have a little free space
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:04.560]   Uh, that doesn't belong to anybody. It's just therefore my comfort and not not to have to keep scrolling because there's one line of text
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.440]   Or one letter that I don't know where it is. So I I just think that it's a it's a design choice
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.640]   I don't think it's mandatory to have bezels as small as possible
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.760]   I think that you make a choice on what's going to work best for the user what's going to work best for that form factor
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:23.040]   And you just you don't go to bezel list displays simply because everybody else is doing it
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:28.880]   It's a notch that that kills me the notch and the chin andy like I can take a reason to have both the notch
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.480]   Not the chin it just seems like you're doing the notch because you want to
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.800]   Yeah, you don't need it. Just make the chin smaller
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.960]   Um, do it samseung does samseung is great. You got a you got a night brown and and a chin
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   You're fine. That's fine
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   Uh, let's see any I mean because we are so close to the release date
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.720]   It's reasonable that the supply chain leaks would be fairly accurate, right?
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.320]   Yeah, this is about the time where when I hear when I hear rumors, I'm more
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.160]   In cli- I'm not going to believe any rumor automatically
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:04.640]   But if you give me if someone shows me a picture of something that doesn't make any sense to be a picture of a
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:11.680]   Of an iphone. I will not dismiss it quite as quickly because this we are now in the zone where there are enough people in on the secret
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.720]   That it can no longer be termed a secret. This is the
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.320]   Is this Ming Chi Quo's uh chart?
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:27.360]   This is uh, I guess all the specs a 12 so even the smaller iphone will have the modern chip right a 12
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.880]   That's consistent with they've done in the past like the the apple the iphone 8 and the iphone 10 at the same processor
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.520]   three gigs of ram on the
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:40.480]   iPhone 9 I'll call it the iphone 9 four gigs in the in the two iphone 10s
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.160]   Benjamin mayo noted something really interesting on twitter today that you have basically
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.720]   A much lower resolution on the 6.1. That's essentially two two x which is apples
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:55.360]   No retina display resolution and the exact same thing for the 6.5 inch but at 3x so they're keeping the same point size
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:03.040]   But you get twice density on the 6.1 and thrice density on the 6.5. I'll let what is x what is x represent?
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.440]   So it's like the original iphone had one like one pixel equaled one point
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.760]   That's when they went to the retina display. There was two x which meant that four pixels made one point
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   And then when you went to I think it was the iphone
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.160]   I forget which one went to 3x first might have been the iphone 10, but then you had uh nine pixels
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.440]   For every point and that's going to be the same thing on the OLED iphones
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.960]   But the lower price iphone because it's a lower priced iphone is only getting too
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.400]   You know you'll be able to visually slightly less distinguish the pixels
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.960]   Single uh single camera on the smaller one and dual camera on the
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:41.920]   Top two that makes sense aluminum instead of stainless steel frame for the lcd version and colors on the lcd version
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.080]   That's actually the newest rumor
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.240]   It's for the kit. It's problematic
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.920]   Well, does that colors does that include the aluminum frame like an anodized aluminum frame or does that just the back
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.080]   Uh, we'll have to see if they can't know an anodize aluminum. Yeah, I mean
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:00.480]   They've shown that they could do it with ipods and with other things. Is it a return to the five c
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.520]   The five c was interesting like apple
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:09.200]   The iphone was this blockbuster movie that they had once a year that everyone would rush to get and then it would taper off for the rest of the year
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.520]   But ipod wasn't like that they'd have a bit of a surge
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   But people would buy ipod they were on the shelves in this clear packaging and they'd be fun
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.400]   And you could see them and you'd buy them whenever you want it to and I think the five c was they're almost like tv series
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.920]   Where you watch them throughout the year?
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.440]   I think the five c was an attempt to make the iphone more mainstream more
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.720]   Programmatic where it would even had packaging like an ipod and it just didn't work
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:36.960]   And now because they they're making this very specifically like it's a large phone. It's not smaller than the iphone 10
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:42.560]   It's bigger than the iphone 10 and that really sounds to me like a product destined for the asian markets
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.160]   Especially but also people who just want a primary computing device
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.000]   That's not that expensive and rumors are they this might be down like at 550
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:55.360]   Which sounds like a lot of money still but when you amortize that over a standard leasing a 0% leasing agreement
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.560]   Which is what a lot of the carriers in the us and you know other places do now
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.960]   So it's much lower than previous
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.280]   Quote unquote new iphones
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.440]   It becomes another attempt to sort of make that mainstream product that you could sell year round
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.280]   Um
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.840]   What else
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:19.520]   I think I feel like we this is like this is the camera the camera is like always one of the best
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.400]   I don't know if it's ready or not yet, but there's been rumors for while that apples working on a next generation AR camera
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.320]   Uh that has the bad
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.600]   Yeah for the because right now if you look at ios 12 the AR cameras on the front is in messages and it's in face time
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   It's not in the camera app and that might be because the new camera is hasn't been announced yet and whether it's this year or next year
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:43.680]   I think they're really working towards a camera system that says fun on the back right like point my camera at leo and andy and alix
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.000]   And give them little hats and little animals and little
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.200]   Glossaraptor nips at your toes and does all the sorts. I'm going I'm going to be very upset
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:58.640]   If nobody can see my own selected little hat because you decided to impose your own little hat upon me
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:05.920]   I just don't think that's right. I can tell like the data like alix has talked about this before but the depth data you get off the iphone
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.000]   10 and 8 camera right now with ios 12 is remarkable and if it's better than that
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.400]   It opens up a lot of really interesting possibilities
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.200]   Yeah, it's also going to be really cool to see how much over engineering is
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.720]   Will will there be in this ar system because you got to figure that if apple is serious about
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   Creating a wearable ar device and they certainly are they are good
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.240]   They they they're nowhere close to actually building the the glasses
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:36.640]   But they can start testing the software they intend to put into it by putting increasingly more and more beefy features into
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:41.440]   Into iphones and seeing exactly how these things work and see exactly where these things fail
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.480]   So I really think we're going to start to see reviews of wearables in iphone hardware
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:52.560]   Yeah, and I think you're absolutely right. I think that that that apple is got the right
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.920]   Solution now. I mean I think that the challenge that google had is they were trying to add everything all at one time
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:03.520]   And and I think apple has years as they as they work on the glasses and they work on those that experience
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:09.440]   They have years to to develop the ar develop it so that when and they have the advantage you know of
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.720]   This 75 million, you know or more people using their their newest phones
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.400]   That they're going to really be able to have all the software kind of lined up when they release a pair of glasses
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.760]   They're not trying to like recreate the wheel. They're just going to move that os
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.320]   largely to them to the glasses
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.080]   iOS 12 is pretty much done too, right? We got beta 9 in the public beta last night
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.520]   So many betas how many betas so many betas
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:40.160]   But that would make sense that that's going to come out September 12th
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.320]   They've got to put it on the phones as they're packaging them up. So they must be done now, right?
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.120]   Was that mean they can't ship those phones from the factory
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.520]   Until iOS 12 is done and then they put it on the phone. They can't image
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.360]   Go ahead. Oh, go ahead. We're gonna
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.720]   No, I was gonna say like worst case scenario. There's an update the minute you open the new phone, but not from 11 at 12 usually
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.880]   You get no phone would ship with whatever the most recent uh build is
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.040]   When they have to actually press them on the factory
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.720]   Yeah, and then if there are any substantive like if they're a last minute showstoppers you open that phone up
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.440]   Because it updates available you have to think that then in that case 12 is pretty much done and they're putting it on phone
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.240]   They better be putting phones on 747s now
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.840]   We'll see we'll see we'll see we'll hit the rumor mill the minute there are pallets of devices arriving
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.000]   That's usually after usually they don't do that till after the event because they don't want anything to leak and it's hard to secure
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:35.360]   Massive amounts of product being shipped. Oh, so there's stockpiling them in Shenzhen somewhere. Yeah
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:41.600]   Exactly exactly they got to make sure that people who show up in the first two or three weeks are going to get the phones that they want
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:46.480]   After that they can they can turn the taps down a little bit and start to go get back
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.360]   That's where to build on demand sort of thing when I trim remind me when I know when I buy a laptop from apple
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   It's often shipped from china
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.800]   Do the phones come to us from china? They do don't they? Yeah, if we're the early order folk. Yep
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.640]   Okay, they almost always have been trying to regardless of regardless you go to the store to pick it up
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:09.520]   Yeah, oh so those days of like loading them onto a container to own a 747 those are for retail. That's for retail availability. Yeah, god. I got it
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.840]   Um
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:17.680]   Do a little sim who cares? Let's take a break because I want to uh, I mean seriously good. That's nice. That's nice
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.280]   Uh
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:24.640]   I want to talk about the apple watch and the ipad because I think we've given that apple watch short-trift and I want to know what you know
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.400]   About the apple watch coming up in just a second, but first I want to tell you about the toothbrush. I'm taking on my trip
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.720]   Whip
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.880]   I realized you know we were you know, we use uh, we used to use you know the big electric toothbrushes
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.480]   And I realize now as we traveled we'd have to pack not only the toothbrush and all that stuff
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.280]   We'd have to pack the charger. It was kind of a pain
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:50.400]   This year we're gonna just pack the quip because it's got a three month triple a battery
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.600]   So I won't need a charger. It's so much more compact
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.840]   And I love the adhesive strip. I could put it right on the mirror
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.200]   And and we're not gonna you know, we're gonna be in one place for three weeks
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.320]   We just put it right in the mirror and there's my toothbrush. We have his and her quips
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   I have silver. No, no least I have silver. I have uh, I have copper or gold. I can't remember
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:19.360]   It's goldish. I guess it's gold silver and gold quip is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the american dental association
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.600]   It is awesome
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.000]   Designed to make brushing your teeth more simple more affordable more even more enjoyable
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.760]   It is a better electric toothbrush created by dentists and I have to say designers too because it's beautiful
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.640]   Quips sensitive sonic vibrations are gentle on your sensitive gums
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:43.440]   People brush too hard some electric toothbrushes too abrasive. They can actually wear down enamel
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.880]   They can make your gums more sensitive quip. Mm-hmm
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:53.680]   It feels good. It's good for your teeth good for your gums and the built-in two-minute timer pulses every 30 seconds
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.080]   So you know when to switch sides helping you get a full and even clean
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.160]   You know 90 of us don't even brush for a full two minutes
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.880]   I do every time because my quip tells me
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.080]   I love the cover that goes right on the mirror there
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.680]   Uh or an unmounced to slide over your bristles as we travel. It's perfect. See that in the bottom

[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.400]   Uh, I mean it depends what's important to you. It's gonna be
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.200]   As a big trend of the last three years. Yeah, it's deleting all the bezels. That's the thing we want to delete all the bezels
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.480]   Not big it's a giant. It's a giant black ring that you don't nobody can complete
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:39.520]   We want to complete our rings. Yeah, you want to just get rid of that. How will this be more edge to edge?
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.400]   We'll actually go over the edge of the aluminum. It'll go to the very edge of the like right now
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:49.520]   It's an illusion because the the interface is black and the glass is black and the casing is black
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.520]   Like it's green doesn't go to the edge. Yeah, the display
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:02:01.120]   So it might not look that much different from the outside, but the actual display inside the glass will go bigger
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.480]   Yeah, and it'll be banned. That's the important thing. It will be banned compatible
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.760]   Otherwise, I would be on the floor sobbing in a learned helplessness
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.000]   I was worried because I saw there that a lot of the bands are no longer available. I thought oh
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.320]   Yeah, no, that's the I'm taking heart and believing that that's the fall refresh
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.080]   That's that's doing that not the suddenly we have bands that are half the width. Sorry yikes
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.840]   Actually, this is good news for in that because he can now buy some new bands
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.200]   Yeah, I mean I guess I keep saying that this is the most effective way apples ever found to separate me from my money
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.120]   You've now given me the band disease. I know
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.320]   I saw i'm reading reddit and there's now ways people have so many bands
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.200]   They're coming up with interesting ways to store and display them
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.360]   And there's a whole band trading community. I think too. Oh, that's a good idea
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.480]   Only this band anymore. I'll send it to you. Oh, you can send me that one. That's great. I don't want to use somebody else's band though
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.280]   I guess it depends on
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.920]   I'm wearing the hook and looper right now the gray hook and looper. I like it. I put on the um the Nike
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.080]   Oh, I love that one. Yeah, phone
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.640]   Yeah, I I have the I have the one that it that it that it came with
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:13.600]   A lot of people do. I mean they just proud of it. It's plastic
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.880]   plural astimer
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.120]   Exactly plural astimer actually come to think of it hook and looper. It's also plastic. It's just different kind of plastic
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.720]   Yeah
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   You brush your teeth with
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.960]   I experiment with a bunch of them and then I just I was like i'm just gonna stick with the one that I have
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.560]   I wasn't I didn't spend the kind of money that Renee did if I if I had I probably would be very happy with my
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.960]   With my but I tried a whole bunch of little ones that were anywhere from 30 to 50 or 80 dollars and
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:47.840]   I just went back to the plastic one. I was like, I'm apples bands are crazy overpriced, but I don't know they're nice
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.520]   I take I take some comfort in knowing that the apple hermez are actually cheaper than the hermez hermez. So that's why
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.280]   Well, they're saving money. There you go. Yeah, it's like half the bun like i'm getting her mez for half the price is ridiculous
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.640]   So they're calling this the series for but really that's just it. There's just the the screen will be bigger inside there
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.600]   I mean there's a lot of question marks and what what happened with the original apple watch is to get it out
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's shipped with at the with the s1 the system and package
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.480]   Process are running basically at the thermal limits of the device. It had zero headroom
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.200]   And over time they've gotten better with a series two the processor was much more powerful
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.440]   And they were able to spend a little bit of that budget on things like always
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.840]   You know more readily available apps and there are a lot of things I'd like to see them do because they're going to get better battery efficiency again this year
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.240]   But the screen is going to be bigger and that takes more power
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:40.000]   And there's things that they need to spend it on like it's still a watch that most of the time is not functioning as a watch because it has no
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.640]   Persistent time display and I'd love to see them spend
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.720]   Some battery because everything in mobile is battery is a currency of mobile
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.360]   Every feature you get comes when you pay for it in battery and you can't pay for two things at the same time
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.840]   You got to make choices, but I'd like to see them start making choices that enable always on display and
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.520]   And a lot of people want you like it apps on apple watch for example
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.160]   I would love an always on display. I have to say it works fine when i'm upright
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:10.240]   But it's not subtle like if i'm talking to you leo like you see me checking the time i want to be able to glance down
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.320]   Oh, I know it's four o'clock
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.000]   It doesn't work when you're lying down or you know, there's you have to be in a certain
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.440]   position for it to work properly and the a lt is still slaved and there's this case to be made that more independent
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.400]   It's like it's like the original apple watch was the shuttlecraft on the original star trek series where I could barely go
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.240]   From the starship to the planet and then now we have the next generation subtle cleft
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.800]   Which can go into warp but not very good warp yet
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:40.160]   And we need to get to the point where you're in deep space line and the shuttlecraft can basically jump all over the universe on its own
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.480]   And you think i'd have learned my lesson and just do what Alex does by the least expensive apple watch
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.280]   Yep, because it's kind of there's going to be an update, but of course I always buy the most expensive apple
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.240]   Yeah, I I started I started with that in the very first one. I was like, I know this is just going to keep getting better
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.120]   I'm just gonna just ride this one. You know instead of
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.920]   Yeah, I just I just it was
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:06.240]   I'm not always smart, but I like ceramic and I like the gray ceramic because I just I like those
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.880]   I think that I think the ceramic is really pretty and I
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.040]   Really want it. It's over a thousand like i'm gonna buy another one next year. Yeah
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.920]   Uh
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:22.480]   Well, I'm not gonna buy another one this year. That's for sure in mr. Uh ming g says enhanced heart rate detection
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:29.040]   Yeah, they're getting better with those sensors a lot of the sensors that I think people expect things like blood sugar analysis
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.280]   Are still years away like there's always a new startup that announces hey, we're ready, but no, no
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.040]   You're not ready with accuracy or scale yet, but you're ready with the rest release
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.600]   So we'll see those over time, but I think the we're getting better with the ones we have for now
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.920]   Yeah
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:51.600]   Apple watches a totally different product than uh than the iPhone or or an iPad it really is you really can't I don't think you can get people in
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.400]   Based on performance and you can't really get them in necessarily based on a larger screen
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.080]   You really have to do two kind of polar opposite things
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.080]   You have to take the features that you're that they count on and make them even better
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.480]   So like things like heart rate and also give it
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.440]   The ability to record other kinds of metrics outside of uh outside a simple heart rate
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.480]   Uh, but also just give them fashion. They don't necessary it's it's one area in which
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.160]   If you suddenly come up with a red one and it's not just a special edition. There is now an official red watch
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:29.920]   At people are going to make fun of it that oh look look how new innovation for 2019 apple discovers the color red
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   6000 angstroms. Oh my god
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.760]   Uh, but nonetheless for people who want a color watch that is a big deal
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.880]   That's the what that's what moves them finally to replace a series one watch with whatever is absolutely modern
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.280]   So and for
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.160]   I think one of the brilliant things that apple has done is given apple watch a sense of focus
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.120]   To know that we're not going to give you where we we had this we we we
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:08:02.480]   Poured out all this banana oil during the product introduction about how we were creating a brand new computing paradigm and brand new platform for software
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.960]   It turns out that people just want a really cool fitness watch
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.680]   They want a cool watch and they want a fitness watch and now they've got one that's kind of both in the same way
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.600]   So it's it's it's just as innovative for them to create a brand new
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:20.160]   Case design or case material as it is for them to figure out how to crack $200 on this device
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.080]   Can we also go ahead? Alex for me. It's it's a wrist a wrist available timer
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.800]   I I find that that is the thing that I use probably more on my watch than yeah anything else
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.160]   Yeah, I like to make tea and it's great or if you're doing a french french the thing is you put your phone down
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.920]   Especially now we have air pods you're you have no idea where your phone went
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.600]   Um, you know you're wandering around and you're listening to whatever you're listening to and just the fact that I can quick quick quick
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.360]   Boom boom boom and it is
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.280]   Transform my workout because it's you know, it's I like to have a few minute and a half sets
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.720]   And so the the issue is is that you you now get it exactly
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.120]   You're not like trying to remember what it was you just hit the hit the watch and you keep on working and and it's just
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.640]   It just makes it so much easier. So it's for me even if that's all it did it's still better than
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:11.360]   A really good watch that I had before a citizen it was it was nice. So so so long as I can say hay slo-mo
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.920]   And have it say and have it just simply bong when I went when I when my egg is done. I don't really
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:21.760]   Exactly. Hey, but I do. Hey, I do the slo-mo to my watch. See you don't even need the the slo-mo anymore
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:29.680]   Now you just uh talk to it. Oh wait always slo-mo feature. That's that's the new. Yeah, that's the new uh, uh, uh watch o. S right is that
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.920]   Yeah, do you have that yet?
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.600]   Yeah, I went into text movement. I mean once in a while like I will yawn and then say
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.800]   Siri to something else and the watch will pick it up because of the text movement
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.320]   But I mean like it's it's trying to pick up telemetry and it's not a pickup signal
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.120]   Then it does this whole bluetooth network or tries to figure out which device you actually mean to talk to based on
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   Movement and behavior and patterns and past usage and time and all these things and once in a while it's just hilariously collapses
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.240]   Like the autonomous car in the snow, Leo. I mean that's your technology you're in and I want to just murder it
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.160]   But there's a lot of potential there when my android war where watch
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:08.640]   Adopted like wrist gestures and suddenly I could just if there if I saw that there was a notification at the very bottom
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.720]   I could suddenly just go I can certainly go like that to simply read the notification
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.320]   Uh without having to do this like harry potter sort of thing with my hand
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.400]   Uh, that's that it's you got to realize that this is this is for my making fun of that statement
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.160]   Just a few minutes ago. This is a totally new paradigm for computing and
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.480]   Motion gestures were at where they're not there. There are only kind of demo interesting on phones
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:39.840]   On a wrist device where you might have that the handle of your rollaway bag in your in your right hand and you just don't have
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.480]   You know you're using the tip of your nose to like activate buttons and scroll through
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:50.320]   Uh, that's where you finally realize that this is this is a great motion. This is a great way to control the device
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.560]   So I hope that I hope that apple really really
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.400]   Starts to look into that because it really makes a wrist device so much more interesting
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.680]   And then tell me
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.160]   That it's not widely understood
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.360]   That 3d touch will be removed from the iphones next year
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   It's not I don't know if it's going to be removed from all of them
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.600]   Apple redesigned the touch layer when they made the old ed display because the previous touch layer
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.720]   Was used the led backlight to measure the disfor- the deformation of the glass
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.920]   To sort of see where you're pressing and how hard and then they had to make an entirely new touch layer because turns out ole
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:32.240]   Doesn't have any led backlighting so they made an a whole new touch layer now
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.720]   They've got a new lcd led but it's a new technology at the same technology
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.320]   I believe that motor oil used not motor oil algae used in the thank you
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.120]   Um, and it to keep prices down. It did not have to make a whole new technology for
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:52.080]   What is probably a stopgap lower cost iphone? I think that the rumor is that that version won't have 3d touch. Oh
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.600]   Yeah, also 3d touches 3d touches one feature that they could get rid of
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.360]   There's there's always an argument to be made for removing 3d touch from a specific product because it was never
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.560]   It never really came through to me as a
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.440]   A major part of the iOS experience
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.120]   It was always like kind of like a shortcut that if you don't know the shortcut
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.800]   You'll still be able to use this feature just as well if you do know the shortcut
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:22.880]   There's going to be a certain amount of learning curve to figure out when am I tapping when am I touching when am I?
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.520]   Long pressing and when am I 3d touching that?
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.720]   may not be worth the ability to
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.400]   Uh have to to save you one tap to share a phone a photo with somebody
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.680]   Um
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.360]   iPads
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.360]   Will we see him september 12th?
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.440]   I mean if they're ready yet totally I think some years apple does like two events some years tim cook just yells clear my skies
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.720]   Okay
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.040]   We say this every week, but I think I have to say every week
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.080]   I'll leave the bezels. Yeah, delete the bezel delete the bezel delete the bezel's 11 inch and 12.9 inch ipad pro
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.360]   Uh, it's gonna be a very expensive september 12th for me or 14
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:09.040]   Viewers and listeners leo you're doing it for the kids ning qo says new airpods and the airpower pad will also come out
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.320]   Does that mean that apple will not sell an after?
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.120]   uh after market
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.240]   Charging case for the earpods. They said they would I mean it and it's just money is money in the bank for them
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   Right, so why wouldn't they yeah
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.920]   All right, let's uh, let's see what else before we get to our picks of the week, um, oh, uh
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.640]   Mojave also beta nine out if you've been using mojave
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.560]   Everybody anybody I have for everything I have
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.960]   Have one machine that's not because google hangouts has not worked for a lot of people since
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.480]   The audio for google hangouts has not worked for a lot of people since mojave
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.360]   Yeah
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.880]   And it seems like that's something that apple and google could fix over the last two months
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.640]   Uh, yeah, they're good. So how you liking it?
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.800]   Uh, it's great. I don't use dark mode anywhere nearly as much as I thought I would because no matter how cool the concept is
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.640]   It just it feels kind of oppressive during the day when I want everything to be light and bright
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.920]   But you can set it to automatically sort of transition during the day
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:10.080]   Which I like because then at night when you're editing you don't have the bright display on your eyes
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.800]   But during the day it's not doesn't feel all dark and broody
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:25.520]   Did you read the the um, nelly bolls review of uh lisa brendon's jobs book
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.200]   Which will come out later in which the most interesting uh thing in the
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.720]   In the profile small fries the name of the book comes at september fourth
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.720]   uh
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.200]   Boles says that uh, even though jobs was a complete jerk to lisa lisa still
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.480]   forgives him
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.480]   Uh, but the best part is maybe she doesn't completely forgive him because she said she didn't inherit millions like the other kids
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.280]   So that's good. He took care of her in his will
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.040]   But she didn't she didn't get the whole uh, whole kit and kaboodle
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.240]   Um, but she says if I did I would have given it to bill gates
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.880]   I'm not mad
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.960]   But if I did I would have given it to a billamolanda gates foundation. Oh well
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:15.280]   It's it's hard to see that as sour grapes or as a as a as a as a backward shot
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:23.440]   Yeah, well, they come on. No, I mean, they've they've cured a non-zero number of diseases. Yes. Oh, I'm not saying it's a bad idea
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.640]   First of all, she's not getting the money loreen gets the money, but uh
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:32.080]   Got the money, but uh, I just thought it was funny. There's kind of gratuitous through that end
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.520]   If I got it, I would have given it to bill gates
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.080]   There was a story and I don't I don't need to draw this parallel, but there was a story about this famous coach
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.480]   Um, he produced a wide range of incredibly talented people
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.960]   But he was known to be a complete jackass and people just said, you know, can you be a great artist or a great coach or something
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.160]   And not be a very nice person and the answer is yes
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.480]   And that may or may not apply to steve jobs, but it was my same problem with the erin sorghain movie
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   Is that I did not need to see a movie about how terrible a father steve jobs is
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.080]   I need to see a movie about how he made next because that was the achievement of his life
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.680]   Right. He was never held up as a as a model parent. He was held up as a product visionary. Right. I agree
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.680]   I know about the stuff, but it's not the focus of
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.200]   I'm just always amazed when someone writes a book like that because it's like, okay
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.040]   So you really don't want to have a relationship with that half half of the family for the rest of your life
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.560]   Like like it just you know, you just well, there's decided that's not worth it
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.440]   the other the other part of that is that
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   She wants to have
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.280]   Excuse me. This is this is something she's been saying and some of the the mark
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:41.040]   Some of the interviews for this that she wants to have a voice in that conversation that there's a story
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.480]   She's part of steve job story that other people have been telling
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:50.400]   And if she's going to be a character in that story whether she likes it or not
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:56.000]   She should at least leave behind her version of events and what what was going through her mind as things were going like that
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.920]   So that's so it's I mean, I don't think that this certainly isn't a cash grab. She could have grabbed more cash
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.280]   For doing it and she could have released it at a better time
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.280]   This is not exactly time where people are clamoring for more information about steve jobs
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:15.040]   So I I respect if that is if that is her main impulse. I certainly respect that
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.680]   New York times
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   a couple of weeks ago published a
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.920]   Times magazine that was entirely devoted to climate change and a
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.000]   30,000 word article called losing earth the decade we almost
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.960]   stopped climate change apple
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.880]   Uh joined about a half a dozen other bidders trying to acquire rice apple got the rights they announced yesterday today, I guess
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.840]   No a week ago. They bought the rights to the series
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.800]   And we're going to produce a
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.520]   Show or a series of shows about it
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.880]   That by itself is interesting, but what's even more interesting because they bought it from the times
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   Is the times
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.280]   Says new york times apple has said it will start streaming its television offerings next year
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.200]   When it will begin competing against netflix amazon and hulu and earnest
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.320]   A little tidbit that no one had ever heard before
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.440]   About burying the lead berry
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   Well, the lead is for a
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:21.600]   But this is this is where the reporting is based on the apple has acquired this property and it tends to and it tends to release it
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.600]   That they've got the means to uh to report on that
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.160]   Whenever I see something like a line like that. I have to ask myself
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:38.560]   Did they prosecute this part of the reporting as hard as they did every single other fact or did someone's or did somebody
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.600]   Who knew about the about the the acquisition deal?
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.480]   Said oh well, you know that apple's going to definitely have their own movie their own netflix type steve streaming service in the future
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.960]   It's it's kind of like
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.560]   They still have facts checkers because that would be one where yeah the
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.720]   You've worked with facts checkers. They would call you and say hey you have this line in here
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.840]   What's the source for that?
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:06.560]   Don't know how don't know how that one that one was edited but
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.400]   Unless I unless I see them unless I see a source for that or at least an exclamation of the type of source
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.520]   I'm willing to put a maybe on that and not say that as a
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:23.200]   I was about to say that just like how uh for some reason it was all over the all over the entertainment news that john goodman spoils that
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.800]   That in the reep in the next season of rosanne rosanne is dead
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:33.360]   Uh, and you see the quote that he gave which could be that he has seen a script and this is he's basically saying
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.360]   The plans that he knows of or he could be simply saying how is this going to be more interesting?
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.800]   I don't know it might be more it's going to be more interesting because she's dead or something and
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.560]   That's some point you have to ask some of the question the follow up are you saying right now, sir
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:51.360]   On on the record that this character is dead or are you saying on the record that you have information
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.960]   About apple creating a streaming service that is based or that is based around this this show so
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:02.320]   Take take part of it. It's like eating grapes. You take part of it. You throw away the stems

[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   from uh, pulp fiction

[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.680]   I'm a chess player the chance to learn how to play chess from the world champion gerry kasparov
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:01.280]   masterclass.com/macbreak all right rene richie time for your pick of the week my friend
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.360]   So i'm going to go a little bit retro with this and i'm going to pick apples leather case
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.640]   I don't usually wear use cases on my iphones because I like them the way johnny i have intended
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.360]   You know all naked and core to the universe
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.000]   But the glass iphones are slippery that the slipperiest phones i've had since the next is four
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.960]   Which when you put it in the middle of a conference table three minutes later
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.440]   It would be on the floor. Yeah, this isn't quite so bad
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:30.640]   But if there is any angle at all on anything it will find that angle and these cases
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.080]   I like them. I don't know if you can see on the thing
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.840]   But the patina that they get i've been using this one for a couple months and they just they age wonderfully you get the brown one
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:44.320]   It looks like indiana jones you get the red one it looks like iron man towards the middle of infinity war and a lot of the yellow one
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.840]   You know the old age sort of really really nicely
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.840]   And they met of course they're color matched every season with whatever new bands and other stuff that apple puts out
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.200]   So if you are a fan of the ensemble the look the outfit you can absolutely do that
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:05.280]   But it's just it's very simple. It's very elegant and it adds a little bit of friction to a device that otherwise
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.200]   Would probably slipstream through the universe all in its own power
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.760]   They're really nice and i am i've mentioned this before but i use the folio
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.920]   Apple folio leather case because i like to keep my you know a little money some cards and stuff my driver's license
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:25.680]   So if I you know this is basically my wallet and my iphone and there's something apple does with their leather
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.880]   I don't know what it is, but it not only ages will but it's very soft pliable
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.840]   I've never found a wallet case that I can have stuff in and closes flat, but this one does yes
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.960]   It stays open and closes. It's like these two remarkable things that i managed to do both
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.560]   And one advantage of a folio like this this is i think it's a hundred bucks yours is $70
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.880]   Is that it covers the screen?
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.200]   Yes
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.200]   So it is a little more it affords a little more protection than most cases because the the screen which is the most vulnerable part of the phone is
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.960]   Somewhat covered yeah, you know it's funny. I did not want to buy the apple cases
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:01.360]   Yeah, but i tried dozens and and then I this is the only one i'm stuck with the folio case
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.080]   Yep, thank you rene
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.080]   Andy and i co your pick of the week
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.160]   Uh-oh, and he is muted
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.200]   Are you mute yourself sir? Yes, uh, that's the pick that's it. Yes, I'm muted
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.800]   I muted myself because I had to go I've realized that I have the I had the thing with me
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:26.000]   But the thing is because this is a uh a camera strap that lets you carry like two two cameras like a gunslinger
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.480]   I I realized that I didn't I should go to the next room and get two cameras to put in there
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.040]   Baby be roaring for your camera
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.560]   Kind of like it's it is it is more like a gunslinger sort of thing
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.360]   That's the this one is the black rapid double breathe and I picked it
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.720]   I should definitely shouldn't have worn a black t-shirt, but essentially it's like later hose and for your cameras
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.040]   Where these two straps so you got one you got a different camera?
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.720]   Dangling from your on your left side and your right side and the great thing is that when you want to take a picture
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.880]   You just simply swing the camera up and it's right there just like you were holding it
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.040]   Just like you had it like dangling around your neck only like while you're walking it doesn't go
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.040]   Into your chest and you don't feel like quite quite such a tourist
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:16.320]   I love what walking around New York City because I'll have like a blazer or jacket on and this underneath the blazer
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.840]   You kind of don't look like a tourist even though you have not one but two cameras
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.200]   Uh slung around you there they do have versions of this that only have that will let you carry only one
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.800]   Uh, but it's kind of cool when you have the ones that will let you carry two because
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.720]   Uh, even if you don't have like two decent cameras like maybe
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.920]   One of the way I hit upon this by accident
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.120]   One of those accidental brilliance things where uh again when i'm just walking around the city
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:46.560]   I will have my uh my my phone in like a really good like metal
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.320]   Tripod bracket and then I can have my phone like on my left side here
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.840]   So not only easily being able to pick it out without having to dig through a pocket to get map information
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:03.120]   But sometimes like if if I want to do photography, I will take out like the the really cool really expensive camera
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.040]   But sometimes you just want to take a snapshot of something and you don't want to have to fuss and bother
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.640]   And so that's when you will like deploy the phone or in this case
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   Uh my little pocket point and shoot the lumus camera. Uh, this is how by the way, I was uh
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.440]   Uh taking pictures of a mermaid parade
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.440]   Uh over the weekend and I had and the thing is I had I had my real
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:28.160]   Had my nice camera that had like a really really super long zoom on it which I took most my pictures on
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.720]   But sometimes I realized that like oh my god
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.680]   This is too much of a zoom or this now they're so close. I can't get them
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:39.120]   We're as if now I can just simply bring up this other camera here and uh and with a different focal length and get that
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.400]   Um now if you go on amazon and look for something like this you can find some of these for
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:50.720]   Uh much much much much much much less than 135 dollars, which is what the double breathe costs
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.560]   But the problem is that this has you might be concerned about what have if I just have this
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.480]   The screw that goes into the tripod mount wouldn't this camera drop off
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:07.200]   Well, no because it's made out of a really really good strong metal and also they have the sort of like locking ring on it
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.680]   So that it can't the the ring that attaches can't like disconnect itself
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.200]   Unintentionally, uh and the other thing is that there are all these little touches to it that I didn't appreciate
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.760]   Until I had this first version of it for
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:26.080]   Uh for a couple months versus the there are these stops that I love that you you can release this
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.640]   And then like clamp it down there. What this will do is like when I'm walking along
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.200]   It will keep it will keep the camera like right over my over my butt
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.360]   So that's not like swing. It's not
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:46.560]   It's not I don't want to be vulgar here, but uh those of us who are male. It's not helping their muffins
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.400]   No, I'm saying i'm saying that because this has the ability
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.200]   On a string it has the ability to swing
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.920]   And if you don't control like how far forward it can swing
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.720]   Might swing forward and down and then it's another childless summer for Andy not go
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:07.200]   Uh, but but these stops you can basically click them in so you can basically set them so that they're always like in the small of your back
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.600]   So even when you're like walking briskly, they're not
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.800]   Even even if you don't have testicles
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:16.640]   They're not they're not to swing in bouncing around everywhere. They're really in control
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.120]   So for all those reasons
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.760]   I think you should I would not trust another company to to make the sort of stuff
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.200]   Especially given that I really really can't afford to replace this lens and this camera
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.360]   A hundred thirty five dollars seems like not a whole lot of money to spend
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:38.720]   Given that I could save a hundred ten dollars and lose like four thousand dollars with a camera gear
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.400]   By the way, not just mermaids in that mermaid parade
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.800]   Lovely day
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   For all sorts of sea monsters things
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.480]   It was technically the sea monster parade but the the mermaids of all ages were quite were quite one
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.800]   Where is this go on and why?
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:59.120]   This was this was this do you have to ask why?
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.800]   See this is this is this is what I don't understand about your job
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.600]   Oh, it's the Quahog festival
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.880]   The New England Quahog festival and sea creature parade
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.160]   I grew up with Quahogs
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.720]   Oh, what fun. What a great day for photography
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.440]   Expedition
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.440]   Please
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:26.240]   Yep, yep another childless summer for Andy ladies and gentlemen. Oh, and this is why blueberry syrup lemon ricotta pancakes
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.960]   Mm-hmm who needs children when you can have pancakes that good. There you go
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.280]   I got more money. I got money more money for pancakes. I don't have any children that want to want me to share it
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:44.560]   And he's in straight like you know well worth following I hn attk o
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   Uh
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.440]   mr
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:52.640]   Let's see we did Andy would he Renee? There's only one person left mr. Alex lindsey your pick of the week
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:32:00.720]   So I had to test this one for a while because I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it. Um, this is the uh, this is the logitech
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.760]   slim combo so it's um it is
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.240]   and and um
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:10.560]   The way I use this iPad I I like it so I can there are
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.600]   Parts of it that I don't so the part of it is that I like is that I can actually take the keyboard off
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.160]   Like this do you have let me ask you this on your keyboard?
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:26.000]   At the top above the function keys. There's an a long oval. Is there a piece of rubber in there?
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.680]   There is mine fell out
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:37.600]   What does that do and boy need it? I think it just keeps the the the screen away from the oh, it's a protective
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.480]   Yeah, it's just there to protect it. It's just keep an eye on that the keys so you don't end up with
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:48.800]   Yeah, I've had mine for more than a year and it's it's falling out. So I guess okay. Yeah, we're both using them. Yeah, yeah
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.720]   I love this the nice thing about this. Here's what I like about it is what I don't like about it
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.520]   You can't use it in your lap
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.120]   So if you want to use it in your lap don't complain when you buy it after I said something because you can't you can't use it in your lap
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:02.960]   But you can put it on anything that you'd like you know because it's got this little kickstand on the back
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.080]   so you can pop this little kickstand opened love it and um and you can set it set it down
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.600]   And what's nice is if you're on a plane, which I'm often on a plane
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:17.040]   Uh, you can tear off your keyboard and then just set this down and and watch it
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:23.200]   Um, so it's nice that way also if you're gonna draw on it and I probably draw on my i've had more than anything else I do
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:28.400]   Um, it's kind of where I sketch out ideas and then they go that keynote ideas then they go into something else
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.520]   And being able to rip that off and just start working on it is great
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.160]   But I do like having the keyboard and I do like having the protection so so the um
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:42.640]   Uh, I I it took me a little while because I was like, I don't know if I'm gonna like the fact that I can't put it on my on my because I have my other
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:48.720]   iPad cases all let you you can just open them up and and actually type on them like they're a laptop
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.400]   And um, so what I really do like also is this being able to put my my pencil somewhere
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.480]   And yes, I lost a little thing on the end. Who whoever leo did you do you still have this little bit? Yeah, this little bit. Yeah, I do
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.680]   Wow, that's impressive. That's pretty good. I lose them
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.600]   I lose them very quickly. Yeah, but uh, but I was losing my pencils and I and I
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.920]   Because I never use my pencil so I
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.720]   Oh, see I use it all the time
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.400]   Well, and and I for a while I was using Andy's idea, which was I got chopstick holders a chopstick case
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.800]   And I had I had some in there, but then it just it was just much easier to have it right here
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:31.280]   So, um anyway, so that's it. It's uh, it's good inside of that caveat. You can't put it on your lap anything else
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:37.600]   It's it's it's a it's a great case and and I like it and don't buy it until you get your iPad because obviously the next generation
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.600]   iPad won't fit this case. You didn't mention back like keys, which is huge
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:46.480]   It is backlit. It's it's a great. It's actually a relatively comfortable thing to type on. I love it
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.520]   I
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:52.560]   It was part of me really experimenting with what I wanted to do as as far as not taking my laptop home every day
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.680]   Um trying to leave it there so that when I get up in the morning and having tea
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.040]   I can still respond to things and and work on stuff, but I don't
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:05.520]   Have to lug the the truck home, you know, every every time and so it's uh, and it's been it's been great that way
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.200]   I a lot of times I get up in the morning and I'm I have to build a lot of presentations and keynote
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.320]   And so I get on I get on this guy and I sit there and sketch out my presentations that I have to do that day
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:19.040]   And then I just leave it on iCloud the iCloud works. I mean, so that's a whole nother thing
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:25.280]   But leave it on iCloud come into the office open up my laptop and build out the keynote doc and so it's it's a
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.840]   It's it's it's a good. It's a good mix
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.840]   I love it. I'm taking it on my trip and this is quite beat up now because I've had it since I got the 10.5
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.640]   And I'm almost certainly gonna buy another one if I get a new iPad because it really is yeah
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.920]   I wish it, you know, it's a little this is a little wobbly
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:47.840]   It is it doesn't grab right on yeah, and so it slides off a little bit and you know and stuff
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.120]   But it's so it's not the greatest case in terms of protection
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.600]   But it's still compact and I just slide that my backpack and I have that on the plane and I love it
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.520]   Yeah, yeah, but let's let's let's let's ping back to what Renee was talking about with his iPhone case
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:08.800]   I really really wish that more like tablet cases were made of like a really nice leather because I'm kind of tired of having to
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.640]   It's they're they're inexpensive and it's fine. So fine
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.440]   So after about six months or a year you throw it away and get another one
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.400]   But I really really want my iPad which is a device that I use almost every single day
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.160]   And as always in my hands when I leave the house
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:29.600]   I wanted to have that sort of patina and that sort of where the the my the oil of my fingers has interacted with the leather and
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.840]   Made these really deep rich patterns and
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.040]   It starts looking like as Renee so aptly say in jeanne johns's bull whip after after time
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:40.240]   You really what you really like the street cred of being able to say this
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:47.920]   My iPad has been places and done things man. This is not this I didn't just I didn't win it in a in a real estate
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.320]   Real estate sales competition. This is my constant companion for the past three years
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.840]   inseparable
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.160]   Yeah, this has this is aggressively plastic
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.960]   Yeah, unfortunately
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.280]   On the other hand, it's rigid enough and yeah, I don't know
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:07.280]   I am I am going as you know a way you guys will be hosting the show for the next three weeks
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:13.120]   Uh tomorrow I get on a plane to bar cilona then on a boat sailing around the western mediterranean jealous
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:18.320]   I am so excited rough life and you won't be able to see my pictures on instagram
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.320]   Uh because I've deactivated my account or on facebook because I've deactivated my account even twitter now
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.440]   I've locked up because I decided I'm gonna go private. I'm done
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:35.520]   I have enough. I don't want it. So I decided here, but you know, I know my family. Oh, we deservedly. Oh, I know
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:40.160]   My uh my family wants to see pictures
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.120]   Probably a lot more than anybody else did anyway
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.440]   So what i'm gonna use is and now we've plugged this before and bill Atkinson was here last week
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.600]   Because I mentioned he'll be here again on friday for the second part of that interview on triangulation
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.000]   But he wrote photo card bill made the most amazing app
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.520]   And I this is what I decided to do is and i've never done this
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.000]   I thought this is about time I did this with photo card
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.920]   You could take the pictures that you take from your trip whatever, you know, you choose and i'm gonna do i'm gonna try to do one a day
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.640]   Put those pictures on a beautiful
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.280]   Postcard that's about the size of a half and eight and a half and by an 11 inch page and then the other side
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:21.040]   Write a little message. This is the message i'm gonna send to my family saying hey, we're about to sit on a trip get ready
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.280]   We're gonna get you're gonna get a postcard every day
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.080]   It take bill mails them himself
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.320]   So it takes a few days that you you know
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.000]   I'll mail this from wherever I am email this from wherever I am and actually you see i have seven addresses so I can do a mailing list
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.840]   And then bill prints them out in uh in silicon valley
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.000]   Prints them beautifully they're laminated and everything and then mails them out
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.440]   So they'll be mailed from the united states not from wherever we are in europe
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.160]   That's a little bit of a disadvantage, but on the other hand
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.400]   Uh it comes faster so it'll take about five days after I start tomorrow
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.920]   Before they start arriving, but i'm gonna send a postcard every day to family and friends
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.840]   And if you're interested we we've used these before for our twit christmas cards
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.040]   Um that they're just it's a fantastic
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.840]   App it's free cost about a buck 50 to send one of these you buy credits
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:15.680]   uh bill sells the credits and then you use two credits for a domestic
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:22.880]   Uh card and three credits to send it internationally and then how much the credit uh cost depend on how many you buy
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.120]   But uh, it's roughly 75 cents a credit
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.560]   So this is so about about a buck 50 to mail really love this app
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:33.440]   So this is uh, and if you guys want to be on the mailing list, just let me know and i'll i'll send you a
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:38.320]   A card as well because I think i'm just trying the old-fashioned way
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:44.560]   Sort of old-fashioned. Yeah, yeah, i've actually sending postcards from my trip instead of posting it all on instagram
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.360]   Now if I had pictures of mermaids that might be different
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:54.720]   Follow Andy and ico he is at ih natko.com you'll also find his flicker
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:00.880]   Group at andi his instagram at in notco his twitter at an notco

[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.760]   Who else has an ico?
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.960]   No, no i'm joking. It was i was just i was an early enough flicker user that was also that was old
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.400]   That was back in the day when i tried to get andi everywhere before realizing that that was a fool's errand and that i'm
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:23.840]   That's it's more important to get the and not go. Yeah, yeah
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:31.120]   Um, thank you so much for being here mr. Alex lindsay follow him on twitter at a l ex

[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.920]   and uh
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.920]   You'll tell you what's going on?
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.080]   I uh, I um
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.160]   I'm starting to try to use instagram more so i'm going the other direction lio i'm i'm
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:51.760]   Posting more things being less private because i don't have as many secret things to do and uh, and then i've heard of this thing called snapchat
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.400]   That i might actually try here. It's the kids like it
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.560]   So if you search for me you might be able to find that and then uh, you're going the opposite way of for me
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.600]   Yeah, exactly i'm going completely the opposite the
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.560]   uh, the
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:09.600]   We it took a took us a little while to figure out how we were going to use patreon
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.680]   But patreon is really my rnd group
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.560]   So if you go if you go there you see me testing all of our training apparatuses and i'm you know
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.320]   i'll talk about video and it's and andi and i are having discussions
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.440]   on
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:26.800]   On the patreon thing as we try to figure out if we want to do something that's a ship that looks like a show and so if you um,
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.200]   if you uh
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.280]   If you want to be part of that it's you can go to the patreon slash pixacore
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.920]   um, and uh, it's pretty it's pretty cheap
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.800]   And uh, it's it's mostly there. It's just like the group that i kind of test things with so um, anyway if you're interested
