[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.440]   the show we cover the latest news from Apple. Lori Gill is here. By the way, you like my shirt.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's all good boys.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.640]   I forgot to ask Mike if he found the chihuahua. It was on my sleeve right there.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.040]   So cute.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   Lori Gill is you don't have a dog do you?
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.760]   I don't. I have a cat who acts like a dog.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.880]   That's actually the best kind of dog. A cat who acts like a dog.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.600]   Lori's managed.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.520]   Except for when he tries to eat your food. Cats aren't supposed to do that.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.800]   Wow. Does he beg? Does he like come to the table and beg?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   Yep.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.480]   Wow.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.880]   And if I put my hand, so I try to stop him from trying to eat my food by putting my hand in front
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360]   of his face to just kind of make him look away. And sometimes he like hisses at me because he
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.400]   really wants the food.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.600]   We, our cats are very cat-like. So if you offer them human food, they look at it.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.040]   And they go, "I'm sorry human. You must have mistaken me for a dog."
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.320]   I wish my cat did that.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.680]   Well, maybe I'll dane to try it. But I am no dog. Just wants you to know.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.800]   That's Andy and I co the WGBH. Boston Andy and I co of Andy and I co.com.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   Fame. Hello Andrew.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.640]   Hello. That looks like a great shirt to wear like when you eating barbecue because no stain
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.920]   would ever like be no suitable.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.320]   That's actually why I'm wearing it. I wore a nice white shirt to work today and
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.760]   turned out must eat and some barbecue in that at some point Oh well. But this shirt you can't tell.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.600]   You're right. This is actually one of those great shirts that my friend Winton Churchill
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.720]   sends me from time to time. He calls it his his Patreon contribution. These come from a
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.320]   brasos design in San Miguel and that you can buy them there online and that's just San Hol design.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.280]   Just great patterns and wonderful shirts. And then all the way
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.320]   back from his trip to Cupertino over the last week for his big briefings. No, they did them all by
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.040]   yeah. Did they do them by FaceTime? Renee Richie.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.680]   We all report. Well, I was trying to truth be known. I was trying to order an Nvidia RTX
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.280]   you know, 2080 and then I was trying to order a PS5 and I was trying to order an Xbox.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Christina Warren's bots. They were just all gone. I'm so based. I got up at 8 a.m.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.600]   and went oh it's September 22nd. Oh and of course they were all gone. I wanted to get an Xbox Series X
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.360]   went to all the possible places. So you have a theory on that.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.520]   Oh yeah that scalpers just read all these bots and I think there's also probably less
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.280]   supply because 2020 is such a hot garbage can of a year. But I think also the supply that there is
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.880]   is eaten up very quickly by the bots from all the scalpers. And unlike Apple which dealt with this,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.200]   I think pretty well a few years ago, you know, when they were having a bunch of issues with this
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.320]   and they made it so you could only buy two iPhones in a row and you had to have a credit card and
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.240]   they put all those other protections in place. It doesn't seem like these companies have done
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.040]   much and people I was just doom scrolling Twitter before the show and people are so angry. It's
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.400]   like one thing after another so salty and so angry. Well to confirm your theory I just went to
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.640]   eBay and yes there's quite a few listings for pre-orders. 890 dollars. Here's one for more than twice
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:19.120]   the asking price. $1,149. $1,099. So yeah these are jerky jerks who maybe they were just lucky.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.960]   They're desperate but maybe they're just jerks. I can't tell. You know I don't want to be a
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.400]   judgey-judgy type. Well also it would make me nervous to order this for sure because you know
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.320]   they don't even have a product all they have is a pre-order. I'm not sure I'd want to send somebody
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.560]   money for this. So they're very- And most of these get taken down I mean they get eBay involved
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.080]   and they get the companies involved and it's just it's bad for everybody because these games
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   should go to people who want to play them. Right. Not people who want to get money off of it.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.680]   Yeah. Now why is it so easy for us to recognize that this is jerk behavior to buy up a limited
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.080]   resource so that you can sell it to people who are desperate at a huge markup. But when it comes
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.440]   to things like water, when it comes to things like housing that's perfect it's just business.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.160]   Yeah. Yeah. That's just- Well then it's like flying all the water so we'll find out how that goes.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.360]   Yeah. Well you know of course tickets it's a real problem with tickets too.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   So yeah there are ways I guess but even I mean honestly I would guess that Microsoft said one
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.400]   per customer and it doesn't matter that's not going to change it you're still going to make
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.680]   your 500 bucks if you can sell it per thousand on eBay. Some I don't know. I don't know.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.480]   I think we'll get that in the lineups too like they would sell their position in the lineup
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.840]   and make a live phone. Yes. Remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Thank god we don't have to worry about that
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.920]   anymore. I don't know. I think we do in a way we do self to worry about that because like I can
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:52.880]   remember Apple Watch maybe it was series three having a similar situation where it was sold out
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.840]   to like you could still order it but your pre-orders were really far back you know months back.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.160]   And I was seeing stuff on eBay that was like buy my Apple Watch right now and you don't have to
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.520]   wait three months to get it even though people could have waited three months to get it.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.720]   Yeah. So I think it does still happen just not as bad as it did for the two consoles but then again
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.160]   like when's the last time a new PlayStation or a new Xbox came out the last time they came out
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.120]   they there wasn't pre-order wasn't really like a thing on the internet like you went and stood in
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.720]   line at your local GameStop or whatever and bought it live you didn't you know there wasn't this kind
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:39.200]   of advanced stuff like they they do now with it so it's new for them too. So Renee to reiterate my
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.840]   question you got briefings right we all got invited to non-briefing so to know somebody who
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.720]   actually got briefed would be cool. I got I actually did. Oh did you? Oh good. Yeah it was just later
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   than Renee. Oh good okay. So what was your we can chat we can. Yes Laurie and Renee are you
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.480]   allowed to say well obviously Laurie's allowed to say she had a briefing it seems like Renee you're
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   being a little cagey with us here. I never know I never know because they always like some companies
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.480]   care some companies don't care and some companies feel like if you say it and somebody else didn't
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.040]   they get people guess. Well I know in my faux invitation it said you can't say apple says
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.080]   from anything you learn from this briefing you can't quote this briefing. I don't know if it said
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.200]   you can't say you had a briefing. That would be a little bit I don't say if yes great you can't even
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.240]   tell somebody you were brief. You can't handle the truth it's deep but it is what the journalist
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.800]   called deep background you can't attribute it to apple or anybody else it's just part of your
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.520]   general understanding. So I'm not going to ask you Laurie or Renee what you learned at the
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.080]   briefings because that would be getting you in trouble with apple and god knows I've done that
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.760]   for enough people enough so I don't want to think I don't want to incriminate you along with me but
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:00.400]   let's talk. For me I don't know what Laurie is. For me I just ask questions most of the time.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   It's just if I if I'm not sure about something or I see people on twitter or really confused about
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.160]   something or there's any way that you know if they're having problems I just try to ask all
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.680]   the questions so then I can go on twitter and try to give the best answers. I'm excited I
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.560]   ordered a watch it's not going to come till Monday. Do either one of you have a watch you could
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.760]   hold up and display do you have the red one I see a lot I think the red one was easy to get there
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.840]   you go. Yeah this is the and this is the other one the se. So Laurie let me see yours because you
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.920]   got the woven band it looks like. Oh no no this is this is actually they sent me just a standards
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.280]   book band yeah so. So a number of people who bought either the woven or the new you know the
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.720]   not I can't remember what they call the non-class. The solo loop and the solo braided. Yeah a number
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.440]   of people are saying oh crud it's too big here comes john let's see john's it's too he has to wear
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.280]   a little higher up on the arm. Did you get the you got the rubber one or the the rubber one
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:06.080]   oh you got the weave. How can we show it without breaking the bubble of our covid quarantine.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:14.000]   He can throw it at you across the room. Might not do it. So I I'm hearing a little bit about this but
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.440]   so I guess people are saying that the printout that they that Apple used to help you figure out
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.040]   is I don't have any of the new bands yet so I don't have my experiences still in the unknown I won't
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:34.000]   get that until next Monday but I read a thread I think it was iJustine's retweet of somebody
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.440]   else saying that there's was two sizes too too big. Yeah in that thread people said it was too small
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.760]   it was too big it was too small it was too big so maybe people don't measure well.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.240]   Yeah that's what I'm wondering is it our fault or is it Apple's fault I don't know you know like
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.720]   I printed it out I put my little credit card on it to make sure that it was the exact right size I
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.600]   did all the things I was supposed to do I measured my wrist. That's what they didn't do. I don't know
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.320]   though they did they said that though in the thread they said that some of them printed it out at 91
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.040]   percent or chrome defaults to 91 percent and preview defaulted to something else and a lot of
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.000]   people didn't bother to make it full size and didn't realize that was a credit card size.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.720]   Yeah so it's not that Apple's sizing chart is wrong it's that people didn't quite understand
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.880]   how to size. You have to print it one to one or you have to size it correctly pull it tight or I
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.680]   mean there's a lot of different there's kind of Apple's fault because they could put like words on it.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:42.880]   Yeah yeah yeah I mean I I I I I I I she retweeted Mike Act Actus who said he went to the store to try
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.840]   it on it turns out he ordered his two sizes too big. By the way bad news Apple treats those orders
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:57.120]   as one order so in order to return the band you have to return the watch so my suggestion is just
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.840]   don't return the band if this is your first Apple watch you just need to get another band from Apple
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.520]   it most of us is not our first time to the watch rodeo so we just can fit multiple sizes too like I
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.440]   got there really I talked to a lot of people like I talked to Gruber and a bunch of other people and
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.360]   they sent us the right sizes and I don't know if they have some sort of wizard or they know
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.480]   is worth in your cupartino. Yeah I don't know but like this this fit like how does that feel does it
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.560]   feel okay. Yeah it feels really it feels like the the other band how do you put it on is stretches
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.080]   enough that you can just stretch it like a rubber band yeah okay and it goes back on that's actually
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.800]   a sensible plan I think if you get the right side I fit the seven and the eight and I think I might
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.960]   fit the nine because there is some overlap this one is perfect the seven is a little tight I think
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.920]   the nine might be fine too but maybe a little too loose so I'm eager to see what the range is when
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:53.520]   people start trying multiple versions. And then so Mike is just too big and I think Mike and
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.680]   knows what he's doing he printed it properly checked it compared to credit card which you're
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   supposed to do you pull it pretty tight you want a pretty tight on your wrist I don't know why yours
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.640]   is so big John but they seem to be a couple of sizes here's about two sizes too big I would say
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.280]   yeah so so it might actually be well sizes aren't that much they're like half an inch or quarter inch
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:23.040]   yeah it doesn't take much though he says he he he got an 11 he's gonna get a 10 and see if it's better
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.720]   but the just he was saying about two sizes too big but as you said then some people say it's too small
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:38.560]   and hmm if you only had stores open this wouldn't be a problem but everything is the worst time they
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   could have done this yeah yeah yeah I know yeah you can't just go in and check yeah very frustrating
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.680]   we're by two and then send back the one that doesn't fit well you could do that they're saying
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.600]   the ones in stores are like the sizing things in stores are working well though so at least that's
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:02.480]   good in theory I wonder what they're doing in store it how that's different then you know that one of
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.440]   the recommendations that apple has if you if you don't have the ability to print it out yourself
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.920]   you can measure with a with a tape measure or you can actually make your own little ruler
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.240]   and then it tells you based on the inches around your wrist what that number is so I actually I
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.160]   tested all three ways because that's what I do for my job is I make sure that everything works the
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.080]   way it's supposed to and I did measure what my actual risk circumference is which I don't remember
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.840]   what it is now and compared it to the suggested size and it was the same it said that I'm a size
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.960]   five right so when I used the paper it said I'm a size five and when I measured my actual
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:48.080]   inches on my wrist it said five so I don't know I'm maybe maybe on some people I mean I don't know
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.760]   it seems really weird that it would I mean just like what you're saying that you know mica
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.720]   printed it out he made sure the credit card fit right and everything and it still came to him
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:04.080]   two sizes or it came to him too large how you like what's what's the what's the little misstep there
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.120]   that apple didn't catch that that is making it's that so many bands I mean it's not a ton of them
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.440]   I think this is probably typical I know with rings and things like that it's not at all unusual
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   for people to get the wrong size but if you have a retail store that's open it's not a big deal
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.880]   but if you don't then it becomes a larger issue especially if the bands are in short supply and
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.200]   that's the other problem is if if you send it back to get a new one you're gonna be waiting a few weeks
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.520]   uh so yeah even if even if you're just sending a band back like if you didn't buy a new apple
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.960]   watch with the band if you just wanted a band like the most of those are also not available right now
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   so just sending it back wouldn't be waiting a couple weeks enough about the band it's a good psa
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.000]   it's a good warning you know you know be careful but what do you think so let's talk about the new
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.600]   features and I fix it did it tear down I think that the 40 inch battery was like 10% larger in the
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.440]   something like that and the 44 inch battery was less little less larger millimeter yeah um
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:12.240]   millimeter what I say inch inch I gave you the first one the second one I said okay i'm millimeter
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.360]   thank you uh thank you Andy for correcting um so our so what's have you had it long enough to
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:27.600]   have battery life uh since uh lory or is this rene did so um mine just came yesterday yeah mine
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.000]   just came yesterday and I don't think that it was fully charged because the s'more I slept with it
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.400]   to just make sure that I've got a lot of people are going to be doing now thanks to the yeah testing
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.560]   that out and at um 6 a.m it was at low power so I popped it onto the charger for just an hour
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.880]   and it was charged up to 85 percent just in that hour so that was pretty great that's kind of what
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.680]   apple said is that you'll wear it at night and then charge it when you take a shower in the morning
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   and you'll be fine you can you could literally wear it almost all day rene is up in your experience
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.400]   so I I'm doing testing right now and I didn't zero load for the first
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.360]   cycle which means I didn't do any I didn't run the workouts I didn't run the ECG anything I just
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.760]   let the I charged it wore it let it die I didn't leave it on for sleep tracking because I wanted
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.120]   to see how long it would last it lasted 36 hours wow I didn't believe it yeah so I did it again
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.920]   and it lasted 36 hours it lasted from the morning through the night till the next midnight and you
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:27.760]   have the 41 meter band I have the no it's I think it's just fresh battery and I didn't have to do
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.160]   an update like it's a fresh install right so there's no there's no sort of updates don't know
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.800]   it's seriously things like that might be where I'm where my battery is different as I um I set it up
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.040]   as from a backup so I've got all those apps loading and storing so that's probably when my
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.760]   initial day wasn't as good as yours so that's what I'm doing now that was just the first day
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.040]   plus all the workouts and stuff your smarts do a load free test because really the load can
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.720]   make a huge difference uh workouts really can kill the battery I don't know yet about the blood
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.000]   oximeter well that's my version of on phones I do Pokemon go because nothing is the battery is
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.760]   hard is Pokemon go so in here I'm doing work out for workouts and and blood ox and yeah and I had
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.120]   um I just for my review because I didn't feel really qualified to talk about the new sports
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.640]   features I got Ray Zehab on the line and he's that extreme adventurer who runs across the Sahara
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.280]   100 days and runs across the Arctic and he was loving it because he he does VO2 max all the time
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   and he loves having it on his wrist and used to get the little pulse ox things but didn't have
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   them with them and he runs altitude he says he doesn't care about the distance he's always going
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.240]   for max altitude and so having the always on altimeter was great for him and being able to see the
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.920]   screen better so for someone I think there's always a lever I really wanted always on display for
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.160]   years that was my thing it worked it's an apple watch that just is not a good watch and they finally
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.040]   gave that to me last year but I think for the people who are who care deeply about the real I don't
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.560]   want to say fringe edge of fitness but like the real deep levels of things like VO2 max and spo and
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.200]   all those things so it'll be like a candy store for them do either one of you
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.880]   have either one of you checked the oximeter with an actual oximeter to see if it's close
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.680]   have not I have one when I get it I get mine on monday I will definitely compare it to a blood
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:26.080]   oximeter although honestly I mean I've heard it's very accurate but apple is not legally allowed
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.160]   to say how accurate it is because they haven't gotten it approved so it's considered a wellness
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.920]   feature not a medical oh interesting but yeah well I think with ECG it's taking so long to get
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.520]   into so few countries right that they didn't really want to go through that again so now it's
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.240]   available everywhere they're just not allowed calling it a medical feature but from people I know
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.680]   I've spoken to have tested it they seem to think it's it's using very similar technology and it
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.480]   gives you a very similar accuracy to those little finger duhikis from the pharmacy and gadget was
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   saying it's a little finicky about placement on your wrist and all and all of that have you had
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.640]   either you had difficulties getting the oximeter to work not at all okay they recommend before you
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.720]   start it the little notification shows up that says um not to have it too far down on your wrist
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   like you don't want back from your wrist a little but that passed the bone I think yeah yeah but um
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   I guess I just automatically wear it that way so I because I didn't have any issue at all and of
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.520]   course if you have one of these um what do they call them stretch band watches yeah solo loop if
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.760]   you have a solo uh and you got it properly sized you probably would have it always
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.600]   up accurate and they don't want you to move because it's 15 seconds so they recommend you put the
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.000]   watch face facing up and you put your hand down on a table oh wow just let it run oh wow if you do
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.520]   move and it and it shuffles around a little bit it stops and yells at you and gives you right makes
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.120]   you go through the instructor manual again so tell me about the always on is it a lot brighter
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:56.560]   noticeably sir Renee you're gonna be able to um account for that because I come from series four
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.960]   so I didn't have always on so I don't know the brightness difference but I would like to talk
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.720]   about my enjoyment of the always on page always on is great yes and you got it when they fixed it
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.960]   because it was so frustrating the first year like I loved it but you if you tapped if you got a
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.280]   notification you would tap it that would wake up the screen but not hit the notification and I would
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.760]   always forget this and then have to tap it again and now it blasts right through oh good I forget
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.480]   that it blasts right through now so it's always on and I go to tap it and I get a second notification
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.840]   sometimes like no I wanted the first one so I have to adjust that but is that a fix is that a fix
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   in the series six or the or a watch six if you have five or six that's been so it's a soft way to
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.760]   handle notification watch oh a seven fix for five and six okay good yeah sorry go ahead it is brighter
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.600]   it's like two I don't know if you can see oh I always forget which way I'm going with this but
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.160]   that's off like that's not right now it looks like it's all right oh yeah oh yeah I tell you turn it off
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.760]   on my series five I think it's brighter too would that be the case
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.280]   I shouldn't because I believe it's a they got a better they have better panel efficiency which is
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:07.520]   letting them light it up more on the series six okay but it's good if you're outside because
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:15.040]   outside the brightness is is more of an issue um I did go outside and um was pretty surprised at
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.920]   how clear it was in dark like in dark in sleep mode or whatever but I like love and I know this
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:31.600]   is a watch OS 7 thing I love that I you know I so I use a workout app that um I interact with on my
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.520]   on my Apple watch a lot so I like skip to the next exercise by tapping my wrist and on the series
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.920]   four that I've that I've had this you know all this time I'd have to wake my screen sort of tap the
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.520]   screen just to wake it up which is very frustrating when you're holding bar dumbbells or something
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.400]   like that but now it actually just appears on the screen and I can tap it really quickly and it's
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.520]   so much nicer it's there it brings my anxiety level down as weird as that sounds to just have that
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:10.800]   happen anything else to say about uh the watch I haven't I keep washing my hands and making
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.680]   squishing sounds and I never get that you have to turn that on oh it works all the time yeah oh yeah
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.640]   yeah you have to enable it I get it when I'm cooking now like if something is sizzling like
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.120]   onions and I'm turning a pepper mill it thinks that that's so me washing my hand turning for 20
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:29.520]   seconds uh the nerdiest thing for me is that they managed to get a 13 thunder and lightning
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.840]   cores into the s6 system and package like it's one generation one silicon generation removed from
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.760]   the iPhone now obvious thought it's obviously it's not as big and it's powerful and doesn't have the
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.000]   thermal envelope or anything but that silicon team is just doing startlingly amazing I think that's
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.080]   the subject of the announcements that they made last week is really because that the iPad Air has
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   a five nanometer processor and it has six cores it has four that's 1.8 times more density than the
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.240]   seven nanometer process I mean it's eight billion none of this was necessary but it's flexing it's
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.160]   three billion we we make our own silicon now so why not you know well the way that apple silicon
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.840]   works is that they don't like they don't want to be a merchant silicon provider and they they
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.160]   don't have other customers and they don't want apple to become like oh we've got the apple watch
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.800]   as a customer and the iPad is a customer so they want to make a scalable architecture that they
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.480]   can do things like put a 13 cores in the apple watch and put the same chip in the iPhone that
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.720]   they put into the iPad and then add extra cores to make that work on the iPad pro and conceivably
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.920]   the Mac and that lets them have really big efficiencies and it means they can concentrate their talent
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:43.440]   and their time but it also means they have to be really smart in making a chip like maybe the
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.080]   image signal processor gets hit much harder in a phone than it does in an iPad but maybe the
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.120]   iPad's thermal envelope is way bigger so it gives you more overhead to use those really intensive
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.600]   apps on the iPad that you went on the phone but that it's that one architecture that's spanning
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.840]   all those things and so it is a wicked flex in many ways but it's a flex that makes them so
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.400]   efficient and so high performance at the same time oh I mean if I were them I'd flex too I mean
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.560]   right it's a flex we all benefit from right you know love those guns apple keep it up
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:24.080]   what else is there to say I did I did not lorry thank you for that tip I did not have the I thought
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.160]   it would just happen the hand washing but you're right there's a hand hand washing setting and it
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.600]   was off so I've turned it off now the next time you're washing hands you'll be really annoyed and
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.880]   you'll be mad at me that I had a turn it on well I know how to turn it off no no no it's nice it's
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.280]   good it helps you remember to wash your hands right yeah I was really disappointed because I
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.120]   can't keep washing my hands hoping that would tell me turn on blood oximeter as well it's not
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:54.800]   on by default okay that's good to know yeah I have to say I was one of the skeptics in the first
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.160]   few iterations of the Apple Watch you know I wore it but it was like yeah it's not a huge
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:06.080]   improvement especially because it wasn't really a watch but I'm super happy with my series five and
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:12.320]   I can't wait to get the series six I think apple is is really has really created the best smart watch
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.440]   I mean it's just amazing it's useful yeah with without question and you're and you weren't wrong
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.080]   remember that took apple a couple iterations before it figured out what the apple watch was
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.040]   all about yeah if you look at the at the launch event they certainly talked about fitness but
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.240]   they were also as eager to talk about oh what a what what a lush and wonderful app environment
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.800]   it's going to be like having like a little bit of your phone on your wrist and everybody just
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.240]   basically started throwing garlic and and crucifixes at that concept and as soon as they realized that
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.480]   we built one hell of a fitness watch and that's what people were responding to they said okay
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.120]   sorry forget what we said we're gonna make the best fit the best wearable and the best fitness
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.240]   watch in the same package and again there's nothing like it it's it is enough to make a lot of people
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.920]   switch from whatever non-iPhone they're using right now to an iPhone well it does really drive that
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.840]   isn't it that iPhone adoption because you can't use it with anything else go ahead Renee I mean
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:13.520]   I would also argue that it's it's it went from this like way for you to not have your phone in
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.320]   front of your face all the time which nobody was really that excited about to a fitness device that
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.040]   everybody was really excited about but there's also a Fitbit and all that other stuff to what it is
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:30.160]   now which is a health and wellness device that to me that it's the ECG it's the fall detection it's
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.320]   the blood oxygen monitor that helps us better understand our entire sort of medical well-being
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.240]   that's even different than just a fitness tracker this adds like something other than that too it
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:48.320]   that makes it stand out to me from all of the wearables just because it's doing what it's doing is like
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.840]   gathering all of that data and turning it into this overall sort of health report on your entire
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.040]   body and you know your sleep and everything so it's it's even gone further than just a fitness
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.600]   device well you're absolutely right because I just I just want to say that the Apple was Apple
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:13.680]   watches certainly not the first watch fitness watch to do blood oxygen levels it wasn't necessarily
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:19.840]   first at many of the things that that it's noted for right now I'm taking a look at the Fitbit
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.560]   sense the new version the new version of that is shipped about a month ago or something and it
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.040]   does have blood oxygen level it also has stress sensing that then that's something that the Apple
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.160]   watch doesn't have yet but what but like Laurie said the big deal with the Apple watches how well
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.600]   it can take all of this data and can and combine it into a very very clear picture of what's going
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.680]   on with your health and your body today not even necessarily saying okay you're in good
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.600]   health today okay you need to go to the doctor tomorrow but simply saying here are some numbers
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.440]   here's what the numbers were the yesterday here's what the numbers were a month ago and by combining
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   all of the stated together it might give you an idea of oh that was that week that I ate like
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.360]   absolute crap all week long no wonder like I wasn't exercising no wonder I was I wasn't sleeping
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.480]   really well perhaps if I did not perhaps if I were not to like take advantage of the all Ben and Jerry's
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.200]   one dollar a pint sale at the stop and shop and have to eat it all in one week perhaps then I
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:24.000]   would not have quite so much trouble sleeping yeah I also think that it's it's what's interesting
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.040]   by the watch it's something for there's there's a feature for everybody so it's all of the above
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.200]   it's not any one thing I mean I do weird things like I like it that I can record audio on the watch
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.440]   you know for quick notes I use drafts yeah it's amazing and and I use day one journal and I can
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.560]   quickly record an audio in the journal so there's little things like that all right and I never
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.960]   really thought I'd use as much as a phone but I answer phone calls most of the time on the watch
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:59.200]   just because it's easier it's quick and apparently people can hear me so there's just it's for
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.400]   surprising I think everybody finds different things to like and to me that's a very good indicator
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.680]   of the strength of a platform if if you have enough features in it that there's something for
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.760]   everybody it won't always be the same thing but there seems to be something for everybody and
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.160]   then there are people I would imagine most of them who find more than one thing because I also I mean
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   if I were if I do a workout without starting the the workout I feel like I didn't get any workout
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.840]   all rats this didn't count I mean you really want to keep track of that stuff so it's good
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.120]   you just put on my Oculus Quest oh I can't do that anymore
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.640]   I get a lot of heat on YouTube because I said I wouldn't want the Oculus Quest because it requires
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.360]   a Facebook account people say you just make a fake fake one no I heard you and Georgia you guys
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.080]   were right I fully support you it still bothers me I don't think they should be required I'm not
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.120]   ordering this Quest too because of it and it's a total tangent but I'm not ordering it there you
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:58.240]   go because of that and you're a youtuber yes they said you sound like a boomer Leo also also
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.440]   also kids Facebook is well aware of that trick yes they have other ways to figure out who you
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.160]   are and other than who you say you are so you can stitch all those fake accounts into one big dossier
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:15.200]   no problem at all I create a fake account on a burner phone that I never use within 15 miles of
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.360]   my house and never have activated whenever I'm within bluetooth range of any of my friends and
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.960]   I will never stop in any of the it's okay yeah right you're doomed anyway you may as well you may as
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:32.080]   well play the really cool VR games and just now did either of you get the se is it was one of those
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:39.520]   watches in se Renee or no yeah okay so tell us about the difference so the se is sort of like
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.400]   a mish a mishmash of the four and the five it it the way I like to think of it is it has a lot
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:52.480]   of the safety features so it has fall detection it has the emergency SOS function it doesn't have
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.320]   all the medical stuff though or all the health stuff so it doesn't have the ECG and it doesn't
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.960]   have the new blood oxygen and it doesn't have latest generation things like the always on display
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:08.640]   so it really is an iPhone 4 plus sort of sort of an idea where you have the basic new design and
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:16.160]   then the latest sort of software amenities that go with that okay so it's not it's not a case this
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.840]   is why it's confusing it's really a case of saving money on certain sensors then we're going to take
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.400]   out a chunk of related functionality it's just kind of all over the place because those are
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.320]   no electric yeah there's no electric heart readers there's no ECG right those sort of things it doesn't
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.680]   have the same kind of panel technology that lets it do the ultra low power zero frame rate mode for
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   for always on display that sort of thing and this is how they got it down to 279 is
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.520]   taken out some of the more expensive pieces and yet I think still desirable both for
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:52.640]   well for anybody wants to get an Apple watch for less it's still pricey I mean this is not an
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.720]   inconsequential purchase and if you're going to use it for your kids you're going to want to buy a
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:02.000]   cellular version which costs more and have a set you'll have a I think Verizon just dropped the
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.200]   cost of their cellular connection on the watch so maybe we're talking about that yeah
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.960]   I'll have to check what their new presence it doesn't do for Gileo so why they even bother
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:21.600]   now what it was what five bucks a month with activation at an activation fee but so it's not
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.840]   hugely expensive but still something to think think about all right would you recommend would
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:34.160]   you get it I'm thinking for my mom maybe it would be a good choice yeah and for anybody who wants a
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.120]   watch but doesn't want to have like buy a phone for that person that's why kids and others would
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.480]   be useful yeah but also like I love it for like if you have an elderly relative and you're worried
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.120]   about them falling or something happening or them getting lost it's excellent because they don't
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.720]   need a phone anymore if they don't want a phone they don't have to have one and you still get like
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.680]   you can still check in on them you can still message them if they fall down it'll it'll call for help
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.120]   if they if they get lost you'll be able to find where they are so it has immense again not all the
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.040]   well not all the health features but it has immense safety features yeah I think that's great
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.000]   you know if that's something that occurred to me about the new band design too because it slips
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.560]   on your wrist but there's no buckle it means that it's less likely to like drop off and so it's not
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.000]   it's not like being at our house arrest it's not like you have you have a tracking brace lit on
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.160]   but if you're worried about again a kid or an elderly relative and you're you're real you want
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.280]   to know that you don't necessarily want them to have to remember to strap this thing on every single
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.600]   day and strap it strap it off again it's probably it's an interesting way to do it also probably
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:43.840]   means if you are doing if you're doing interesting fun things on diving into water you will not
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.240]   show your watch will not show up in one of those youtube videos where hey I'm a professional diver
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.600]   and I decided to go to this water park and hey I found 18 apple watches and they always have the
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:00.400]   exact same like rubber like snap wrist snap bracelet on so yeah correct myself rises 10
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.880]   bucks a month T-Mobile's 10 bucks a month yeah I think it's 10 bucks across the board why did I
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:13.840]   saw I saw a five buck I thought Verizon lowered it maybe it's for new maybe it's a one year first
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:21.600]   first month's frayed kid yeah come on in yeah 10 bucks is ridiculous because it's just ridiculous
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:28.560]   you already have an account especially when you don't so I up until family set up I would have
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.600]   I would have told anybody don't get the cellular plan it just you just never use it because I've
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.640]   never used it I mentioned that last time I've never left my house without my apple watch so
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:44.160]   I mean without my iPhone so it's really unnecessary to spend 10 dollars a month on that but now that
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.360]   there's family set up there's a lot more of a reason you know would be I don't know what the
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:56.000]   plans are gonna be but it would be really nice to see the the cellular companies give a discount
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.840]   for multiple watches on a cellular and so maybe it's 10 dollars for one but it's only 15 dollars
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.200]   for two or something like that there should be a family plan much like the apple one bundle
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:12.560]   two carriers are so funny though it's like they imagine a pizza delivery company asked you how
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.320]   many people would be eating it and charged you based on the amount of people eating the pizza
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.960]   not just the size of the pizza but that's what carriers do all you have two devices the same data
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.960]   but you have to pay for the extra device oh two people are eating your pizza same pizza but
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.840]   you got to pay for the extra person eating it wow I never thought of it that way they're
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.800]   making money off the hardware it's all it's always service based business right and you can
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.360]   also think of it the way you would like a hotel room or something which is the mo tell room is
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.480]   probably more like it where two people it's you know one price but if you bring in your friends
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.840]   to spend the night you have to pay more for those extra people so it exists as a thing even though
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:56.160]   it seems silly like why do I pay more for the same stuff just more people using the same stuff but
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:07.120]   it exists yeah psi the world is not fair low fire fair um did either i know apple didn't say
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.320]   anything to you either of you but if they had would they have said anything about a ship date for
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:21.840]   fitness plus just nebulously this year this year yeah fitness plus i think apple one is earlier
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.160]   and fitness plus is a little bit later i forget what the exact order was one was this one was uh
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:33.360]   this fall and one was later this year right so i think i think um apple one was the first one yeah
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.440]   it'll happen and then eventually down the road to get fitness plus which is so weird what can take
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:45.920]   so long to make fitness plus they've been planning this for months years years covid yeah covid really
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:53.360]   maybe we could just blame covid for everything i do i certainly do uh two weeks to october six
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:59.280]   i wouldn't mind having an iphone announcement two weeks maybe three it'll be two or three weeks right
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:05.200]   i hope so yeah all right we don't know anything more
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.960]   we are we are seeing a lot more substantive leaks uh right now than we have in the past three weeks
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.040]   so maybe it's because more stock is being shipped out more data is being more people are being trusted
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.120]   that normally don't get trusted until they can't possibly do any damage right so it's so weird
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.160]   though like today's was eddy they had eddy it leaked out that eddy q spoke to a carrier in europe
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.720]   um about their launch plans for 5g and how they were the first carrier to do bundling and you see
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.840]   eddy sitting in what i can only imagine is his living room or study or something and it occurred
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.920]   to me we're seeing so many executives like not all of them have the tim cook desk that looks like
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.880]   the apple store architects just set it up a lot of them are in their living rooms and you see people
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.920]   like people who are famous technologists or like close to sci-fi and they're in what looks like a
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:59.200]   victorian doily factory never what you imagine here's eddy here's eddy q yeah he's got i think
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.960]   eddy's sharing a panos pene's uh paneled living room
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.880]   was that his camera last for sure that's a surface duo camera if i've ever seen it
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.920]   oh that's terrible but ting tock it's probably a mac book
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:18.640]   uh so we are this is what this is the quote from british telecom we are just a days away
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:25.280]   from days away from apple's major launch of 5g phone this is an internal presentation
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:33.760]   shared with bt's customers or employees today so but days could be two weeks
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.480]   days could be 14 days well they're remember they're they're metric days because they're in england
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.280]   hahahaha
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:47.040]   i don't yeah it's good it's not gonna be next week it's not days it's probably weeks
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:54.080]   well you know it won't even though the invites and the event announcements it's it's different
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:59.920]   this year i am still seeing like they're giving us a few days notice didn't they give us
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:06.400]   a week's notice for the apple watch event so i'm thinking about a week's notice again so
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.960]   if it's if it's next week they probably should have or would have given us
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.280]   notice today or maybe at the latest tomorrow so i think you're right leo i think
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:25.680]   we'll i think what we if all goes smoothly um next week we'll hear about we'll get the announcement
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   of of of an event the following okay that's that seems about right all right it doesn't it goes
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:39.600]   against the rumors though of of it being mid-October so the week of the of october 12th that has been
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:46.400]   a big rumor but i'm also thinking maybe this it might be that apple was just ready sooner than
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.160]   they originally planned and maybe they'll go a little early yes also google's all google's having
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:58.800]   a a pixel five launch event i think the 20th yeah 30th 20th 20th 30th so yeah so week from tomorrow
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.120]   yeah i know because we're streaming it so or you know it might be the first pixel event that
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:09.360]   gets me to buy a samsung phone oh god you know what i did i'm almost ashamed to admit it but i
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.560]   returned the uh microsoft duo oh yeah and i'm gonna take the
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:21.520]   i did like it but i didn't like it enough to use it you know and i can't really justify
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.640]   1500 bucks or something i gotta use yeah so i like the original fold though it's like you like the
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.360]   idea and you're hoping the second gen will be better well it's exactly not just not just the
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.440]   fold i think it's like the original iphone where there are a lot of people who suffered with a
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.240]   with a not terribly great phone compared to what they could buy at the moment because they saw
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.280]   they saw things that they've always wanted to be able to do with the phone they couldn't do
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.520]   with anything else so i hope that microsoft doesn't decide to go i have a i have a box of gadgets of
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:56.160]   things where microsoft had a really great launch event and then they had a version two of the
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:02.480]   hardware where it was just uh we're we're doing some in person person briefings and then maybe
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.240]   there was a third version where they did a digital press release and that was it and then you never
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:13.280]   heard from oh you have your kids don't you you can't do i have i have my microsoft fitness watch i've
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:19.200]   got a couple of zoons i've got a it's it's a nice it's a nice oh yeah i i actually do have a spot watch
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.080]   i didn't i don't have the i don't have the freaking magnet version of spot but i do have a spot watch
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.920]   actually actually it's funny i when i was packing to to move a few years ago i came across it dropped
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.080]   in the charger to see what happened and of course it was all it gets all of its news via
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.280]   fm radio and that's that's all been turned off but it's frozen at the moment and like i don't know
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:46.640]   what was it 1999 2000 with the last it was like oh my god it's like there's a company called
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.360]   facebook and they're thinking of going public or something anyway uh but yeah it's it's a it's a
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.760]   great idea i would be really really excited i'd be more excited about it if it were an apple project
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.320]   because apple doesn't again it would be it would be like the apple watch where i don't get it but i
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.920]   know that they put a lot of effort into the hardware knowing that they could always change
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:15.120]   the software later uh so we'll see yeah i i yeah i hope it's not a microsoft health band or a spot
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:22.080]   watcher akin i hope it's a platform going forward i suspected is that what i decided to do is
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.080]   take the money put it toward a galaxy z-fold too just to see you know try the other
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.800]   designer edition leo did you get the box no i thought
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   tempted though i might have been i did get mystic top is i wikipedia tom brown
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.040]   tom brown isn't evidentry for no idea he's a famous designer posh place
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:46.080]   all i know is red white and blue stripe that's it that makes it that makes it
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:51.040]   thousand dollars worth a thousand dollars more yeah uh no i thought i'd be interested to try it uh
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:57.840]   and it works out if i send my note ten back for a five hundred dollar uh
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:04.560]   credit it turns out to cost the same as the duo so yeah i'll we'll try it again this is this is why
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.760]   you don't make you don't make fun of in a first first hardware ideas that seem silly because what
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.480]   they do is they prove that it actually works and then suddenly you're saying gee i wish apple made a
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:20.320]   phone that folds in half yeah because i finally i finally one of my friends has finally bought one
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.520]   of the third generation devices and gosh it looks nifty
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:30.480]   i was like i i every year i buy the nexus with a pixel and this is the first year where i'm thinking
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.040]   ah the pixel five doesn't look that much different than the pixel four i might get the fold instead
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.960]   yeah it's it's a rebuilding year after after the cussing out that uh australow gave the entire crew
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.080]   a month before the launch of the pixel four yeah i i don't think that the battery's very good
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.320]   what did you really get like okay i guess like where have you been for the last year rick
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:58.400]   yeah exactly it's like oh dear i didn't hear about that wow okay oh no that was it was it was a
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.320]   about literally the the launch event was in october and this meeting was in late august in
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.520]   which he outlined everything he was disappointed about the pixel four fees and apparently they're
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.400]   doing pixel five i think my pixel five is a very incredible jaws not knowing what the
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.960]   iphone would be exactly that's appalling yeah that's that's that's why that's why i that's one of the
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:22.880]   reasons why i bought a pixel four a because i thought that i i believe that whatever i believe
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.360]   that they're gonna that google is going to need to have an entire year at least to catch its breath
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.120]   and figure out what it wants to do and i this is this would be a very very good
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.920]   year to see how far i can get with a three hundred and fifty dollar phone because that means that in
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.800]   twenty twenty one i'll have much more money in the kitty left for uh for a five g phone be it an
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.840]   iphone or a pixel or a sam song i said i said pixel five i meant pixel four i like my pixel four
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.400]   excel it's a it's a nice phone it's just not dramatic and it was i thought i just thought it was too expensive
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.640]   for what it was well that's everything it's gotten better it's better than it was a long
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.440]   it was that's true absolutely i know but it's fine now it's very usable i'm just i'm just yeah
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.040]   and for all my saying oh don't don't make fun of those folding screens because in three years time
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.720]   at the same time i'm the person who's like oh my god on board radar that will that will respond to
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.720]   in air hand gestures that could be if they actually do something with that that could be really cool
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:20.800]   and now they're saying yeah not so much that was dopey that was dopey but they know it was a great
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.640]   idea and experiment for them and they flip flop every year it's like today we're gonna do it not
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.080]   tomorrow we're gonna put on this punch hole we just want to experiment with everything that is
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.440]   android and you're like but i like that don't take it uh someone else will do it no they won't
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.440]   i think the punch the the whole punch is an evolution i don't think i think that you put in a notch
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.600]   because you have absolutely no choice but to put in a notch or you can't think of any ideas
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.200]   around putting because if you have to put all those 3d sensors in the front there is no way to put
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.680]   the only false word to a notch is to put like a forehead in it and no one's gonna let you do that
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.160]   they do all of it in the same year like it's like i don't know if it's an opinion or they just
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.800]   want to do something to help android like so that they feel the pain of all the android manufacturers
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.240]   and they can make sure it runs well on all of those devices so they do want to be each
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:09.920]   let's take a little break and then we still have the ipad to talk about and other rumors and
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:18.240]   things and stuff uh laurie gill is here she is managing editor at imore.com rene ritchie at youtube.com/rene
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:24.320]   ritchie and when is your when is your apple watch uh you had a first look but do you have a review
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   coming up soon i had an unboxing i do i'm hoping for the towards the end of this week i'm getting
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.960]   all the pieces in place look forward to that and Andy and i gotta be laurie as you chill do it better
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.800]   laurie are you working on a review are you gonna do the review for i sure am it'll probably be the
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:44.320]   end of this week too oh man the deadlines i know see i like my life's easy i just get this stuff
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:52.480]   play with it and go i think it's okay yeah it's pretty good i'm actually looking forward to trying
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.000]   the fold i i love the i love the idea of a dual screen device but it just didn't quite make up make
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.120]   and a lot of reviewers are saying oh no the fold actually now is pretty usable so it'll be
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:09.760]   interesting i just i just have to say of the of the two designs i'm really excited about the
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.720]   the interface ideas that are capable of your capable of inside a folding screen yeah let's
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.520]   excuse me a two screen of the hinge in the middle yeah that's why i like i thought the duo i thought
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:25.840]   i ordered the duo in lieu of the fold because i thought gee has a wing for you lio that wing is not my thing
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.160]   you can make it into a gimbal it's just so big i didn't think it'd be that big it looks like a
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.920]   moment it's it's it's like the phone mascot for t mobile it's like no it's like it's like on a dc
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   comic from the 1960s where like the the villain is named like the tumbler and so like his phone is
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.800]   the shape of the letter t and his car is the shape of the letter t and i thought it was a shape of
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:55.440]   these acts yeah it was so huge i like the idea but it was just so huge the microphone very odd
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:01.600]   uh looking phone the idea is it's what's kind of like the sidekick i guess in a way
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:08.880]   because this there's two screens really and one's or is there just one screen and a little screen
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:15.920]   it's one it's one of the half screens one of the half okay i don't i just don't i don't i don't get it
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:22.720]   i don't i don't get it i mean maybe i probably you know what when i send the fold back i'll get
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:30.080]   this yeah i'll keep my search will continue for the perfect phone that can twist and fold
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:38.000]   twist and shout the origami phone what's full display does anybody in the chat room have a wing
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.560]   an lg wing anybody try it i don't know if they're shipping it are they shipping it maybe that's right
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.880]   okay all right this is an expensive time a year because all the new phones come out all at once
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.280]   our show today so maybe i better make some money our show today brought to you by Twilio
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.080]   actually i spend money on twilio i've had a twilio account for years i love twilio if you are building
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:06.480]   something interesting you will like twilio the world's changing fast you want to build new ways

[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:54.000]   authentication it's all there we had the the guy who wrote authi in the studio back when we
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.360]   had studio audiences and i just i i said i'm not worthy that you made a great app and it's and i
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:05.200]   said explain to me why some of these guys are uh are have a different kind of interface in this
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.080]   though they're twilio customers that's why it works better marketing teams use twilio to get

[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:49.440]   um the apple store the apple tv plus and apple music we got down earlier today and they're back
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:55.440]   up now not sure what that was all about i thought maybe oh they're they're getting ready for apple
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:03.360]   one but no it was just down it's just down just down just happened it was just iranian in
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.640]   in hak russian hacker groups yeah back by back by government just government spying
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.520]   how do you say uh encrypted email solution from germany called tota nota
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.360]   and they they've been they've i think it's all right now but they were deduced non-stop for several
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:27.040]   weeks up and down up and down it's very frustrating bad guys are so bad so do either of you have the
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:34.000]   new air by any chance per chance that's not available yet are we not available yet okay well i mean
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.320]   it could be more than that they just said october if they didn't give us any kind of date i'd be very
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   interested i hope we do benchmarks on those just to see if that new processor uh how much faster it is
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.560]   they're not making it available because they know the iphone is coming with it and they don't
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.880]   want people doing exactly that before they announce the iphone so it's possible coming october means
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:58.960]   coming with the iphone so that'll be the uh air 14 bionic is the iphone 12 chip
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.160]   it just came out it comes out a little earlier in the ipad is that what you're saying basically
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.800]   it may it was announced earlier with the i don't know if it'll come out any earlier got it in the ipad
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:14.560]   got it but it's it's a good chip it's a good chip it'll be nice to have that in the phone
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:20.160]   uh jib dalrymp was on twitter on sunday and he said you shouldn't really think that this in this kind
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:27.760]   of impacts the 11 inch ipad pro in any way there's enough features different in the ipad pro from the
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:35.920]   ipad air the faster processor by itself does not push the ipad pro 11 out of the way for single
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:42.720]   threaded operations uh neural engine and machine learning it is the fastest thing that apple makes
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.840]   and which probably means it's the fastest thing in mobile right now right the ipad pro still has
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.120]   two additional cpu's four additional gpu's twice the memory bandwidth six gigabytes of ram
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.000]   it's a lot 120 hert refresh rate yeah uh quad stereo speak i mean the list yeah
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.120]   yeah if you if you want to do any sort of high-end graphics work or any sort of large file
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.440]   work the ipad pro is still it's it's a race truck instead of the race car but it's still a race
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.400]   truck right yeah that's why that's why this it's going to be an interesting distinction for them to
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.520]   try to mold for most people particularly the people who come with expectations of a tablet
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:27.200]   having not quite so much capability as a desktop uh it's anything that doesn't come with a hinge and
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.720]   and a and a keyboard can't possibly be a high-performance machine it's going to be hard for them to
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.560]   understand why these more expensive ipads even exist there's going to be hard for them to even
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.200]   get that kind of value out of the extra money that they spend the ipad air is going is really the
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:47.760]   Volkswagen. You can get a
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.960]   waltz mech. For everybody and
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.680]   it's it behooves apple to make
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.640]   sure that adobe keeps on working
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.140]   for a photoshop for iPad that
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.140]   all these high performance apps
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.640]   really show off why there needs
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   to be a I pad pro and an iPad
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.700]   heir instead of just simply
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.760]   saying we've got an iPad heir
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.200]   and we've got an iPad heir that
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.760]   also has a terabyte of storage
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.280]   which can't do they? Well, yeah,
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.720]   that's what we don't know. I mean,
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.320]   they just want to have an A for it.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.600]   I mean, I hate for Apple to hold
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.880]   off just the sake of holding off
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.560]   and they have done two iPad pro
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.360]   two iPad refreshes in a row.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.840]   They did both spring and fall
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.680]   2012 with the three and the four
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.440]   and they sort of had to because of
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.800]   three was under power of note.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.400]   They didn't update the 11 is just
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.240]   the 12 inch.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.640]   Right. The updated.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   It's 12.9. That's the one that
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.720]   has the lidar on it.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.640]   They don't think they did that for
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.520]   the 11 or did they?
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:44.160]   The 11 is updated in 2020.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.680]   It was OK. Both of them.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.280]   OK. OK. But we need five.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.840]   Like we don't need, but like five
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.040]   G's coming the A 14 X is coming
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.080]   and rumor is many LED is coming.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.080]   So I think if they want it, if
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.520]   they didn't care about many LED,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.480]   we'd have it already.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.720]   If they do care about many LED,
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.280]   maybe it gets pushed early next
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.600]   year, but it's like an awkward gap
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.560]   more than I think anything
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.800]   deleterious and they're probably
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.360]   still happy if you buy either one.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.640]   It's actually Pat Lee.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.760]   Apple had a story about many
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.440]   LEDs saying Apple and this
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.880]   actually comes from Minkchi Quo.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.880]   Apple has chosen a second supplier
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.800]   for many LEDs, which
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.320]   was a go says, Oh, that means
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.280]   2021 in the iPad and the Macbook.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.640]   I hope it's such a better
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.680]   technology than I'll let.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.480]   Well, it's potentially such a
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.640]   better technology than I'll.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.160]   Is it really you really like?
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.160]   I mean,
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.960]   OLED is a fantastic technology
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.560]   that has so many problems.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   Like you have to mitigate
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.320]   against burn in and off
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.640]   axis color shifting and the
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.280]   blue sub pixel burns out
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.720]   faster than the other sub pixels.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.920]   So you get this pen tile
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.360]   arrangement and it's just this
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.760]   long list of things that every
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.680]   manufacturer has to always
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.680]   keep in mind.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.840]   And many LED should let us get
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.400]   very close because it uses
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.240]   local dimming zones very close
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.440]   to as much black, very, very
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.480]   bright highlights.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.040]   So you'll get as much dynamic
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.640]   range, not maybe as much as OLED,
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.200]   but you'll have a lot of the same
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.040]   benefits without any of like any
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.080]   of those mitigations.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.640]   Right. Yeah.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.160]   The challenge is going to be
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.560]   that usually when we talk about
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.640]   usually when we talk about how
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.280]   good a display is we talk about
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.800]   how well it displays photos, how
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.640]   well displays video.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.120]   But really the the apex feature
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.640]   of a display on a tablet is how
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.040]   well does establish the user
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.640]   interface, how well does it convey
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.200]   text, how easy is the to read over
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.240]   a long period of time.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.880]   So it really has to be a balance
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.120]   between those two things.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.520]   It has to look good in the demo,
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.280]   but it also has to look good after
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.560]   three hours of answering emails.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.920]   Good.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.320]   So if this rumor is true and
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   again, it's just a rumor.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:55.040]   Sannan opto electronics will be
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.400]   shipping mini LED dies for Apple
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.480]   iPad and MacBook from 2021
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.840]   supplying 20 to 30 percent of
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.880]   their products next year and
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.360]   almost half or more than half,
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.120]   even by 2022.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.920]   And that's going to bring the price
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.880]   down currently.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.200]   The total cost of mini LED
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.320]   display chips would be 75 to
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.280]   $85, but adding the second
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.760]   supplier will reduce the cost
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.120]   down to $45.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.720]   And you know, does that mean,
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.640]   does that mean, Leo, that you're
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.160]   going to have to wait even longer
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.800]   to get a new iMac or
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.040]   MacBook Pro because you're going
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:34.640]   to wait for the money.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.000]   Wait for the mini LED.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.960]   That's a good question.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.560]   Is it that much better than I
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   should wait?
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.320]   Well, they're not going to do
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:41.360]   OLED.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.320]   Well, it seems to have pretty
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.360]   good arguments for that.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.600]   They're doing LCDs, though, on
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.560]   the on the other companies are
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:47.920]   doing it.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.400]   But the last I heard Apple's not
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.720]   happy with the continuous
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.880]   brightness levels when the
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.120]   screens get so like, oh, they
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.240]   figured out how to really well
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.720]   on phones really well.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.080]   Well, it kills your battery.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.440]   I have to say, I had an OLED.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.640]   I have an OLED Lenovo thinkpad
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.360]   and the battery.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   If you want the screen, let up Leo.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.400]   Well, yeah, that's why I got it.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.280]   But then if you talk about an
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.440]   iMac, you don't have to worry
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.240]   about power consumption because
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.160]   you'll be plugged in the whole
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.440]   time.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.720]   So that might be the perfect
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.120]   screen to do something like that
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   on.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.680]   Can I buy OLED monitor, a
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.680]   desktop monitor?
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.080]   Does anybody make them?
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.480]   They do.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.880]   You can buy them from like
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.440]   from relatively inexpensive all
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.920]   the way up to those, the ones
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.600]   that Sony makes for color
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.680]   profile management and movie
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.440]   theaters are like $42,000.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.120]   Yes, I've seen those.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.040]   Yeah, reference modes.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:40.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.320]   So these are actually Samsung
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.880]   makes a 49 inch OLED.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.760]   Oh, no, that's QLED.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   Nevermind.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.600]   That's one of the yeah, that's
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.400]   LED.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:48.920]   I don't know.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.840]   I don't see any these.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.320]   I searched for OLED and I got a
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.160]   bunch of LEDs.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:53.480]   Let's see.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.200]   OLED monitors in 2020.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.400]   The current market status.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.280]   Acer has something called the
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.280]   predator.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.400]   You saw Nick.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.040]   Oh, he told the one third
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.640]   or market towards gaming.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.520]   That's in January.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.360]   Well, those are the people who
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.400]   pay for them.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.480]   True.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.640]   And those are the ones who are
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.440]   paying who are paying for
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.120]   performance enhancements that
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.720]   allow them to kill fake people
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.520]   much much faster.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.160]   So I just found my new monitor.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.600]   A 55 inch OLED gaming monitor
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   from Dell.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.360]   It's only $3,877.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360]   That's all.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.080]   That's all 55 inches.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.600]   I can watch TV on that thing.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.240]   That's bigger than my TV.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.760]   Yeah, that's gigantic.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:48.960]   Let's talk about iOS and iPad
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.600]   OS 14.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.160]   We're developers.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.440]   I saw a lot of people say, oh,
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.160]   developers are shocked shocked
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.440]   and Apple's pushing it out the day
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   after the event.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.880]   Did that really take people off
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.280]   guard?
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.360]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   I think it took.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.440]   I think it took the tech bloggers
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440]   off guard.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.520]   A lot of developers I spoke into
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.120]   is that they kind of when Apple
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.880]   gets so predictable and here is
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.560]   what happens.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.840]   Here is what has happened every
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.280]   single almost every single time
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.600]   before they've released it to the
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.280]   public.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.480]   They kind of plan on it and they
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.520]   put all of their time
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.280]   budgeting into it.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.440]   So a lot of people were really,
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.720]   really shocked that, OK, well,
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.400]   we didn't have time to really do
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.040]   the final spade of tests on our app
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.120]   that we were supposed to be doing.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.840]   But good luck, everybody.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.000]   Yikes.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.440]   I was kind of thinking that was
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.480]   going to happen because they had
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.400]   the beta seven and beta eight in
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.520]   rapid succession.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.960]   That always feels like to me like
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.400]   they usually say it's GM at the
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.320]   event like the trip like and past
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.640]   is not always predicate, but usually
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.080]   at the event someone says they're
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.840]   going into GM today and they'll be
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.520]   released next week because that's
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.160]   a day before the iPhone is the new
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   iPhone is released.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.960]   But 2020 Leo, it's it makes every
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.640]   devil and Emric movie look like
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.920]   they undershot disaster rainbow.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.640]   Like, we'll be also think about
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.120]   this.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.720]   OK, you know how there was the
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.400]   original rumors that they were
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.440]   actually going to release the
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.080]   the Apple Watch just with the
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.120]   press release the previous week.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.520]   Right.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.400]   So timeline wise, that lines up
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   with the launch of watch OS and
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.360]   iOS and everything because it's
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.200]   almost like they didn't push out
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.280]   the software early as much as they
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.600]   released the hardware a week later
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.240]   than then they were originally
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.040]   planned to because that aligns more
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.920]   with it having been launched.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.400]   I don't know, was that the 15th
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.280]   or something like that?
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.160]   I don't even remember anymore what
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.840]   the original rumor was that it was
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.720]   come we come out with.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.640]   Think about that.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.880]   So maybe good point.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.360]   Maybe they postponed the hardware.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.880]   Interesting.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.960]   Maybe they're just big meanies.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.920]   You hate developers.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.280]   Well, a lot of developers quickly
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280]   leapt into action.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.800]   James Thompson immediately got a
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.960]   peak calc widget out or dice.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.040]   Actually, I love him so much.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.040]   It's a dice widget.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.640]   We did on iOS today earlier today.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.560]   We did a bunch of widgets.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.280]   There are quite a few widgets now.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.160]   Third party widgets are out.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.480]   And I think there's some very nice
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.240]   ones if you want, you know, kind of
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.040]   a review of a ticket with custom
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.600]   home screens.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.040]   Well, can I everywhere?
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:25.360]   Yes.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.080]   Can I just say how joyful
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.520]   widgets have made social media?
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Because every single person who's
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.880]   that's that's the reason why they
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.800]   they're there.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.120]   They're impatient to download and
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.000]   install iOS 14 because they want
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.760]   to play with widgets.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.160]   And now, oh, look, I put my kids
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.560]   photo here and now I've got this
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.320]   widget there.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.960]   It's like, oh, I'm so happy to see
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.200]   everybody so happy.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.840]   Like usually it's rare that I can't
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.920]   remember the last time Apple has
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.640]   released a feature that has made
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.320]   so many people so joyful at the
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.000]   same time.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   This is a TikTok.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.960]   What do you call them?
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.440]   Influencer who is now up to like
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.120]   almost a million followers, catamogs
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.880]   on fleek creative who is really
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.400]   racking up the views 9.1 million
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.600]   views on how to make your iOS 14
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.000]   home screen aesthetic AF.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.160]   Not 9 million views on TikTok.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.880]   And that's after the president shut
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.480]   it down.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.680]   So just keep the widgets.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.120]   Yeah. Actually, this is a this
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.520]   is widgetsmith which we showed.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.720]   And I thank her because she taught
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.600]   me how to use widgetsmith to make
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.440]   my home screen aesthetic AF.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.360]   David Smith is another one of
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.200]   those genius developers.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.000]   Like you always have your James
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.880]   Thompson's your David's.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.960]   I think David Smith probably did
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.560]   six apps the day they announced
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.600]   iOS 14.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.360]   So that's good.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.440]   I mean, and I have to say I'm
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.320]   liking these widgets.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.680]   These are not as capable as
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.520]   Android widgets.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.520]   They're not really live exactly.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.880]   You can't enter texts to them
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.600]   or anything like that.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.880]   But I your Apple Watch widgets
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.120]   that are meant to conserve battery
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.800]   life at all costs.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.320]   Right.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.440]   But I also think.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.640]   But yeah, and I also think that
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.040]   they're covering most of what
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.640]   people even in the Android world
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   use widgets for.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.880]   I think they took they really
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.600]   took them the best meat off of
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   the bone.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   And they're there.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.880]   It would be great if we could
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.400]   set up pay individual pages
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.640]   with active widgets there when
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   I travel.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   We're traveling.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.800]   I would almost I would almost
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.120]   rebuild my phone to turn it into
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.640]   like I can get it any piece of
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   information that I need or any
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.440]   any note taking any reference in
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.520]   like one or two swipes.
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.400]   But mostly when I'm using it for
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.120]   is I want to see what's the
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.000]   weather going to be like where I
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.320]   want a shortcut to to a certain
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.800]   app or a certain feature that
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.360]   lets me tunnel all the way down
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.560]   into the feature that I want.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.080]   I'm so I'm so one of the first
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.240]   widgets that I installed as
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.840]   a matter of fact was the Google
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.800]   widget on my iPhone because it's
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.440]   and unfortunately now it is
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.000]   easier.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.400]   I feel as though it's easier to
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.120]   access Google lens, which is one
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.320]   of my favorite Google features of
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.000]   all time.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.800]   It's faster to access it on my
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.200]   iPhone than it is on my Android
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.440]   phone because it's built into
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.720]   yeah, it's built into the so I
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.840]   have to basically activate the
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.480]   assistance that's one swipe and
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.280]   that to remember like how to with
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.080]   lens it's like I'm I'm
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.800]   gonna store.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.640]   I've actually actually the first
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.760]   time I used I was in an antique
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.600]   shop over the weekend and there
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.560]   was this beautifully like bronze
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.960]   bronze plaque with some sort of
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.480]   saying on it in I believe German
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.760]   and it was very very decorative
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.080]   but I app given its age.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.600]   I absolutely wanted to make sure
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.400]   I knew what that phrase said in
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.960]   English before I even considered
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.600]   buying it and I actually I had
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.800]   both phones my pocket actually
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800]   wound up like going directly to
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.360]   Apple because to the iPhone
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.080]   because that's the one that I
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.160]   remember that Oh, if I actually
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.640]   just tap this one button, it will
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.240]   translate it's going to translate
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.400]   the German for me immediately.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.480]   The one thing that's amazing to
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.920]   me is it feels like the iOS team
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.720]   at Google the iPhone team is
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.800]   loves the iPhone slightly more
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.920]   than the Android team loves a
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.960]   pixel. But all of them hate the
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.640]   iPad, which is that that's
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.440]   psychology inside Google for some
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.680]   bit like they will make all these
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.840]   features immediately available
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.840]   for the iPhone, but you want a
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.240]   side by side app on the iPad.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.200]   You're waiting five years.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.360]   I think that I think that inside
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.600]   they have an institutional
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.680]   problem with tablet size.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.520]   Anyways, even there even their
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.600]   own damn I'm so when I when I
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.800]   got my first Chromebook that I
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.480]   was going to be using in anger,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.160]   I was so surprised that the right
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.000]   answer is not going to be. Oh,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.720]   well, obviously I'm going to
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.480]   download the Android Google Docs
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.440]   app and that's going to be a
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.800]   fault. No, it actually doesn't
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.600]   work nearly as well as the web
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.600]   based Google Docs.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.320]   So this is this is don't feel as
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.240]   though Apple doesn't like iPads.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.240]   They just are distrustful of any
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.280]   square acreage beyond I don't
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.720]   know, like eight square inches.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.960]   They they they feel as though
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.600]   there be dragons on the old time
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.200]   e like see there's map do not
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   do not cross this pixel dimension.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.360]   I have to say I was very shocked
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.120]   at how iPhone users have jumped
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.880]   on widgets. I would have thought
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.240]   that would be a feature that they
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.960]   would just go. Oh, no, I like my
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.600]   grid of icons. Thank you very
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.160]   much. You it's new Leo.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.600]   Everyone but there's a lot of new
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.960]   things people don't jump on. I
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.160]   mean, I may we'll see if it has
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.800]   longevity. People jumped on me
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.720]   emoji day. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.600]   It's new and it's on you and you
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.000]   can make your screen look like
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.280]   it's work and especially now
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.480]   because there's no theme kit
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.440]   still. There's been rumors of
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.000]   theme kit for a few years, but
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.280]   we've never actually seen it.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.720]   So people are using this as a
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.000]   de facto way to customize our
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.480]   home screens, which some people
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.280]   have been wanting to do for a
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.920]   long time. Apparently, you know,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.520]   it's a pain in the butt. So will
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.280]   they keep doing it? Who knows?
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.920]   I'm just I'm hoping that Apple
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.320]   actually releases a proper theme
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.800]   kit and there's a quote unquote
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.920]   bug that prevents you from
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.280]   setting comic songs or marker
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.120]   felt as your default font. But
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.360]   other than that, lets you do
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.360]   you. Yeah. Well, actually, some
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.160]   of these widget maker widgets
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.880]   do have marker felt fonts. So
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.400]   sorry. Bad bad news. I don't
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.080]   think they have Merlin call.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.400]   We said Merlin called David and
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.320]   just I have words with him. Is
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.360]   that who did the serious is
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.840]   widget maker who did this
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.360]   widget? Yeah, widget Smith is
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.440]   underscore David Smith who did
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.320]   like sleep plus plus and oh, a
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.880]   ton of other like so many. I
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.960]   feel like eight apps a year.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.920]   Okay.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.720]   Interesting. Okay. He does
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.360]   power the weather data with
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.920]   dark skies. So maybe he's been
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.200]   working on it for a long time.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.800]   I don't know. I don't know. Well,
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.240]   that's still work. Probably not.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.200]   Good. Oh, that's good. Okay. So
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.920]   this is not I at first, I
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.560]   thought, Oh, this is some janky,
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.640]   you know, app that will not be
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.880]   very good. But in fact, it's
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.640]   quite powerful. Yeah, the
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.520]   amazing. Yeah.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.000]   I think I hope Apple, I'm sure
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.360]   Apple is observing and listening
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.920]   that every time the way that
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.400]   the way that iOS users managed
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.040]   to morph and twist a basic
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.560]   feature into doing something
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.440]   unexpected and wonderful, like
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.840]   everything that Apple everything
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.800]   that users did to exploit the
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.680]   ability to put pictures and put
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.040]   animations underneath the watch
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.960]   face. Like some of these are
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.720]   just heroically done. They
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.680]   really look like brand new watch
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.160]   faces or brand new like data
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.560]   portals almost and everything
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.640]   that people are doing to make
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.720]   widgets do the things that they
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.600]   want to do. You got that's
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.000]   that's some really good marketing
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.040]   research that just shows you
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.320]   that look, people are willing to
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.120]   suffer that bad and use
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.400]   use this really, really janky
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.800]   sort of hack to get an
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.560]   approximation of this feature.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.080]   Maybe we ought to give them this
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.520]   feature for real. Yeah.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.000]   Well, it's something that's been
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.760]   in Android for years, but now
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.640]   that it's an Apple, people are
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.560]   jumping up and down saying, yeah.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.880]   And shame on speaking of social
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   media, shame on all the all the
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.720]   Android people who look welcome
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.560]   to welcome to 2006.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.720]   Like, why can't you be happy for
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.040]   people who are happy?
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.720]   What is it been? No, I just
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.560]   I just borrow Stephen Hackett's
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.840]   2007 era Mac and just walked to
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.440]   dashboard and go look, look,
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.000]   dashboard dashboard. Dashboard.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.680]   Dashboard. Yeah. Oh, God. Give
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.240]   give me give me a scrapbook
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.560]   widget. Give me like an old
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.680]   school system 6.02 scrapbook
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.200]   widget. I will switch back to
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.960]   iPhone. So, Lisa, the Lisa
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.760]   calculator. I would take all the
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.560]   desktop early Mac or Lisa widgets
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.280]   right? I suppose developers could
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.720]   do that, right? There's they could
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.120]   do that. There's not. Yeah.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.560]   Well, you can't make a live
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.280]   calculator with the widget
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.040]   capabilities. You can't. Oh, but
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.320]   I forget the name Lori will know
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.520]   it because it's it's mainly and
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.200]   Bridger Maxwell's company, but
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.960]   they put a whiteboard in a widget
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.880]   and it's brilliant and I'm
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.960]   blanking on the name. You can
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.640]   draw on it.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:52.160]   Nope. I'm looking on the name
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.720]   too. Like that is for iOS.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.560]   She used to work at Apple. Yeah,
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.000]   she used to work at Apple on the
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.080]   design on Johnny Ives team and he
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.880]   was with an Apple to I forget where
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.040]   he is now. He's an ace coder and
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.400]   Inco they crammed.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.400]   Is it in? I'll tell you in two
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.520]   seconds. I just got to launch.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.360]   I'm just googling.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.720]   Isn't see where whiteboard
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.760]   widgets.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.560]   But I thought it could scribble
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560]   together.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.120]   Scribble. Oh, it's using scribble,
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.960]   though. That's why I was thinking
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.200]   I was thinking I knew that was
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.800]   wrong. It's it's really the app
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   is called script together.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.400]   It's an app. But does it have a
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.920]   widget? Yeah, they they they just
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.400]   updated it with that. Right? Yeah,
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.880]   that's so okay.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.600]   So I didn't understand that. Oh,
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.800]   I remember this. We played with
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.160]   this. Yes, we played with this in
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.280]   iOS today. Yes. This is so cool.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.960]   So this has a widget.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.760]   Man. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, this
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.120]   lets you do collaborative
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.160]   scribbling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.360]   Meleko and Bridger Maxwell.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.800]   Yeah, we were actually in the
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.600]   scribble when one of them came in
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.080]   and said hi, I think it was
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.200]   melee because it was very good
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200]   drawing.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:17.320]   If they if they kind of surprised
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.800]   everybody with iOS 14, you think
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.200]   it's possible that they'll surprise
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.280]   everybody with big sir.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.760]   Well, the night the eighth beta
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.360]   just came out. So I'm thinking
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.240]   we're going to see that pretty
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.240]   soon.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.680]   Yeah, we might see it next week.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.320]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.360]   So you'll cook to you yet.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.040]   It feels not quite cooked to me
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.480]   yet. I'm I'm especially having
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.760]   problems with Safari.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.560]   So I sure hope that they're doing
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.280]   some some stuff because the things
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.720]   that I'm having problems with Safari
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.960]   have to do with work.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.480]   And so it's a real issue for me
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.200]   and it's and it's a Safari issue.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.800]   What do you what so this is
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.080]   Safari 14, which is the first part
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.240]   of Big Sur, which actually is out
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.280]   for everybody now. Safari 14.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.320]   So what what does it work?
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.320]   It's all back and stuff with our
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.600]   content management. It's like a job.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.680]   It's not anything that anybody
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.200]   else is having. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.440]   I actually really might still have
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.240]   an event for the apples. Sorry.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.480]   No, please. You can't start
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.440]   as it is with the rumors are and
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.920]   then not finish it.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.040]   No, I thought the rumors that the
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.440]   event for the Apple Silicon Mac
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.840]   could be late October, maybe even
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.920]   early November. And if they if they
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.200]   do what they did here and then say,
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.840]   Oh, and the software is coming today
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.360]   at that event, I will be happy for
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.320]   the extra time they took.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.520]   Yes.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.720]   So that's the question.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.560]   Do they release Big Sur before the
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.560]   Apple Silicon Macs?
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.240]   They could and it would not make
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.600]   a single difference.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.360]   But that's never really been like
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.000]   an issue for for Mac is to have.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   You know, iOS and iPhone always
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.400]   kind of release at the same time.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.640]   That's just what they've always done.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   But Big Sur has always come out
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.760]   before or during or after and a
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.640]   Mac launch. So that won't even matter.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.120]   I think like Renee said, it'd be
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.880]   nice because it would feel like it's
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.400]   more ready for the public.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.320]   But I wouldn't be surprised if it
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.560]   came out next week and we have no
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.360]   word of a Silicon Mac at all.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.960]   Just shipping out of the blue.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.600]   I hope they don't because I started
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.880]   a hands-on Mac series.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.040]   It doesn't start till a couple of
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.440]   weeks from now on up the road to
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.760]   Big Sur and you know what you should
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.080]   do to prepare for it and upgrading.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.640]   And I started by talking about
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.760]   14s for 14, which you can get now
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.120]   and has some very nice privacy
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.920]   features. It has a it tells you,
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.920]   you know, what plugins are running
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.720]   on websites with privacy invasions
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.200]   are on websites. It's really nice.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.920]   I think they've done a very nice job
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.760]   with Safari 14 customizable
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.680]   blank, you know, home page.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.400]   A lot of nice features, backgrounds
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.720]   and so forth. And I guess big time
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.960]   improved performance.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.400]   The privacy report, that's what I
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.600]   was trying to remember.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.360]   You can click a link and I'll show
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.800]   you all the cross-site trackers
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   that are being blocked.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.680]   It has something called intelligent
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.640]   tracking prevention.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.360]   The tab bar finally shows
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.040]   favicons and a thumbnail when you
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.200]   hover over it. That's something
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.920]   other browsers have had for some time.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.360]   But OK, fine. And it and most
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.760]   importantly, finally remove support
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.280]   for Flash. Is that the problem?
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.200]   Using Adobe Flash at your back end.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.680]   I hope not. I hope not.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.280]   RB, are you being paid to punch
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:21.720]   monkeys?
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.360]   That's the end of the line for Adobe
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.280]   Flash. How the luya.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.960]   Anybody having problems besides
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.880]   Laurie with her back end?
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.880]   Sorry, Laurie.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.120]   It came out wrong.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.000]   Anybody having problems with
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.880]   Safari 14, any reason to hold off
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.800]   on upgrading? Otherwise, aside
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.160]   from that, that's the first time
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.240]   I've heard anybody have any problems.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.000]   I think it's pretty.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.080]   That's pretty seems fine.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.080]   My use is pretty milk toast,
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.400]   but I've had no problems with
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.600]   whatever. Although I should point
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.800]   out that I'm only using it like three
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.280]   or four hours a week, like sessions
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.200]   in which I'm forcing myself to use
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.040]   this. This is my default.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.760]   Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.760]   What do you use default, Andy?
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.800]   Just out of curiosity.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.840]   What hardware?
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.680]   Browser. Oh, browser.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.840]   My my default when testing is
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.360]   Safari because I have to test
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.280]   Safari as well as anything else.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.240]   My usual default is still Chrome
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.440]   only because I really like the
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.800]   I'm kind of addicted to.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.320]   I'm kind of I'm kind of addicted
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.240]   to the bookmarking as such a
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.200]   critical part of my workflow of
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.600]   like three or four or five different
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.280]   projects. Like every time I'm
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.920]   I'm flagging something that maybe I
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.120]   want to talk about it on NPR and
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.760]   Friday. Every time I want to talk
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.560]   about it on this show on a podcast,
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.560]   anytime I want to write it simply
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.040]   it sells. It's really important that
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.880]   I separate the I don't have time to
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.920]   investigate this right now.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.120]   Right. Something to follow up on.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.520]   And I used to use a third party app
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.840]   for that, but then Microsoft bought
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.160]   it and decided to turn or something
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.040]   that it wasn't. I loved wonder list
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.720]   because the reason why I think I
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.120]   recommended on this show was that
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.080]   it just tries to be a list.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.560]   It says we will let you do lists of
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.080]   things. We will let you name those
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.640]   lists. We will sync those lists
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.280]   between platforms will make it very
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.840]   easy to bookmark URLs in a list.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.680]   And then Microsoft said, and now as
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.560]   part of your personal productivity,
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.160]   you can attach to it. It's like, Oh,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.840]   God, don't don't mess me up.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.800]   And every and so I the only real
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.600]   attachment to Chrome is that I
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.880]   found out that it's just really,
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.400]   really simpler for me to just use a
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.080]   built in bookmarking tool, make
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.880]   sure things are organized in folders.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.840]   It syncs all across all of my devices
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.000]   because I'm using Chrome pretty much
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.960]   out everywhere. If I could find
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.400]   something, a third party app that
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.000]   worked as well, I very well might
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.480]   switch back to Safari because on the
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   Mac, there's just there's nothing
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.440]   that performs as well.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.280]   Yeah. I use Firefox just because
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.600]   I'm it's cross platform. If Safari,
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.760]   I mean, that's the problem is I use
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.720]   a variety of devices. Safari is only
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.280]   on Apple devices. So but Firefox
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.600]   has a lot of the before Apple put it
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.080]   in Safari and a lot of the privacy
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.680]   protections that Safari is just added.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.640]   So yeah, again, it's as far as the
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.080]   latest weight though on I think
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.680]   everybody agrees on an Apple is the
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.360]   in terms of battery use. Yeah.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.440]   And the and the weird thing is on
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.360]   my Windows 10 machine, I don't have
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.760]   nearly the problems with Chrome as I
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.880]   do on on Mac.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.240]   Yes, terrible. I can I can really
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.800]   see my Mac suffering the longer I'm
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.840]   using Chrome the with with Windows
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.560]   and tabs open on my Lenovo
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.600]   on my Lenovo Carbon X one, which
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.320]   is five years old at this point.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.800]   It seems as though I can use that
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.600]   machine exactly the same way and
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.000]   Chrome is just not bringing it to its
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.720]   knees. I just don't know what the
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.720]   answer is on Mac.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.040]   I've I've tried I haven't tried it
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:41.560]   on Mac.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.200]   A new it.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.840]   Yeah. No, I haven't I have tried
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.520]   it a little bit on on the Windows
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.960]   machine. I just can't think of a
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.840]   compelling reason to install edge
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.920]   on on on on my Mac.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.680]   I don't know what the I don't know
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.800]   what problem I would be solving by
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.760]   Chrome edge.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.920]   It's kind of a lighter weight
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.960]   Chrome. Yes.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.760]   True. But if I if I'm looking for
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   something lighter weight, I've got
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.560]   Safari. Right. So that's the for
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.520]   me, that's the solution to the
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.880]   problem on the Mac, although it
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.800]   would be cross platform.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.840]   Of course, Renee, what do you use
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.240]   for a default browser? I use I use
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.080]   Safari.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.320]   But I do have sort of a jail for
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.680]   Google apps in Chrome.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.040]   Does that feel like Google?
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:18.600]   That's a good.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.120]   Google really wants those features
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.520]   and there are some sites that have
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.040]   there's like this battle between
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.280]   Apple for privacy and battery life
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.320]   and Google for progressive web
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.080]   apps and more native like
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:29.960]   functionality.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.040]   And a lot of people are just coding
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:32.800]   for Chrome.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.560]   They were used to code for IE.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.520]   So I feel like I I'll use Safari
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.040]   as a default.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.120]   And if it doesn't work, but says
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.320]   this browser is not supported or
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.200]   something's broken, I'll then,
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.800]   you know, carefully, gingerly go
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.800]   over to Chrome and do it there.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.160]   I think like one of the things that
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.440]   I still dislike is that we're
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.640]   we're collapsing down and I would
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.920]   never have guessed WebKit would win
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.040]   the browser wars back when it was
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.280]   KHTML and Conqueror.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.000]   I would have bet any amount of money
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.280]   that, you know, IE
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.040]   Trident would own the web browser
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:00.720]   world one day.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.960]   But now we have almost nothing else.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.600]   I mean, Firefox is keeping Gecko
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.200]   going a bit, but everything else is
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.520]   using WebKit derived to blink to
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.320]   Chromium now.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.080]   Right.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.040]   I started using DuckDuckGo, which
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.760]   is now out on iOS
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.240]   because it's a privacy focused browser
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.680]   on iOS and it's one of the few
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.240]   browsers you can make your default.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.480]   And, you know, it's WebKit.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.000]   So it's just like Safari with a few
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.440]   extra features, which is great.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.120]   You know, you get the best of both
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.080]   worlds, mostly accounts.
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.720]   And like if you use if you think
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.680]   other default browser is mostly
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.320]   for account, that's why I use Firefox
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.520]   because it syncs across all my
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.000]   platforms.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.400]   Lori, I take it.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.080]   You're using Safari since you have
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.200]   to use it with your back end.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.760]   And it's sort of similar to Renee,
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.400]   not even for my Google apps as
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.200]   much as just
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:50.840]   Google Meet doesn't work very well
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.440]   in Safari.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.320]   So I switch over to Chrome so that
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.360]   I don't crash while I'm in the
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:55.800]   meeting.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.600]   That's literally the only time I use
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.760]   Chrome is to have a Google Meet.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.920]   I can't be a Chrome around for that.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.400]   You're right.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.880]   You got to see better.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.160]   Really?
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.880]   That shows how weird and how
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.160]   badly managed the web is that I do
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.080]   have three on my Mac.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.640]   I have always have three browsers
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.360]   available on.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.440]   I think I'm a Windows machine.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.360]   I also have two or three.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.480]   And it's the Chrome is my default.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.960]   I've got I've also got the one.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.440]   I've also got Firefox as one that
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.440]   has no plugins, no nothing in it.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.760]   So that's the one that like runs
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.600]   really, really fast.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.280]   But then of course, I also always
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.000]   have the tour browser because any
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.520]   time that I'm watching TV and it's
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.960]   one of those YouTube channels in
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.600]   which like, hey, we took this
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.840]   this $18 million supercar that we
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.200]   bought at a salvage auction for $80
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.880]   and we're going to bring it all back
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.240]   to sometimes you want to Google
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.320]   and say, well, how much does this
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.360]   car usually cost without making
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.480]   marketers think, oh, and he's
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.640]   thinking about buying a supercar.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.200]   Let's change all of his ads to
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.000]   home loans and stuff like that.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.840]   The other issue I had with Safari
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.720]   was they changed how extensions
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.880]   work for good reasons for security
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.280]   reasons.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   But my preferred ad blocker, you
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.200]   block origin no longer is available
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:05.880]   on Safari.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.520]   And I, you know, I feel like that
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.320]   the content blockers they have.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.160]   I use Wiper, but I feel like they're
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.520]   not quite as good as they used to
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.480]   be. The extensions are much
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:14.840]   of the...
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.040]   Ghostry.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.440]   But that doesn't block ads.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.720]   That just blocks trackers.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.560]   Actually doesn't even block
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:20.840]   true.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.240]   Also, it blocks tracker.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.120]   Okay.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:23.680]   Okay.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.520]   I stopped.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.880]   I stopped using Ghostry when it
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.280]   got way too annoying.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.520]   It's like, I know there's a
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.520]   there's a deep dig down and find a
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:30.760]   saying.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.160]   So please don't tell me about
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.000]   extended services.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.160]   No, please don't tell me about a
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.320]   survey you want me to do.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.240]   Don't worry for me.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.040]   Only on Chrome.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.000]   I wonder if the Safari is not
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.080]   powerful enough to do that.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.080]   Oh, I have to try Ghostry.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.720]   Blocks, ads, stops,
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.320]   trackers, and speeds up websites.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.360]   Plugins now, that's part of Big
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:48.720]   Sur.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.960]   So this is like a...
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.120]   They just have to port them,
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:51.720]   basically.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.640]   But they're going to use the
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.840]   same style as Firefox and
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.440]   Chrome soon.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.080]   Well, they are.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.600]   Okay.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.080]   That's one of the big surfers.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:57.480]   So they...
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.280]   Was that a dead end or a bad
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.040]   fork in the road that they took?
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040]   Because they...
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.480]   I know they really eliminated the
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   functionality.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.640]   It was noble, but it ultimately
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.640]   failed because they couldn't get
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.800]   support, which is like the
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.880]   classic problem when you do
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:11.720]   something different.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.000]   That's one of the reasons I don't
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:13.680]   use Safari's.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.400]   The limited number of extensions
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:15.920]   available.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.680]   You know, that's an issue.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.760]   Well, speaking of support, that's
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.280]   going to be at some point,
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.360]   Apple's doing really, really good
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.760]   work on behalf of the users to
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.760]   maintain privacy and also
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.000]   awareness of what websites are
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:30.840]   doing in the background.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.960]   They could, however, at some
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.440]   point, cross a line where the
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.880]   money pipeline is starting to get
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.800]   pinched off for a lot of these
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.240]   websites.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.080]   And they say, well, guess what?
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.920]   You're using Safari.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.360]   We will not let you use Safari
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.880]   unless you turn off these features
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.400]   or switch to Chrome or something
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:47.920]   else.
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   So it's...
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.920]   There's...
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.600]   I know there have been
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:51.840]   negotiations behind the scenes
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.080]   saying that I know that there
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.760]   must be a happy medium between
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.360]   allowing us to have our revenue
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   pipeline while also allowing
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.880]   removing the most of the most
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.800]   egregious abuses.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.600]   But that might be a fight that's
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.680]   coming in the next year or two.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.440]   Let's take a little break.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.080]   And then we can talk about the
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.760]   Emmys, the AirPods studios,
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.400]   you one chip and a variety of
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.360]   other things.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.520]   It's Mac Break Weekly with Ray
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.680]   Richie Andy Inaco.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.720]   Laurie Gill, our show today brought
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.400]   to you by ITProTV.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.280]   If you're enough of a geek to be
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.520]   listening to our shows on Twit,
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.280]   you're probably interested in IT.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.640]   This is a great career.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.840]   Let me tell you, even, you know,
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.040]   if you've got a current career,
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.080]   maybe you're thinking, I would
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.600]   like to do this all the time.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.920]   You need, though, to get your
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.680]   first job in information
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.040]   technology, whether it's fixing
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.560]   computers, securing networks,
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.920]   doing pen testing, you know,
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.440]   anything you're doing, you need
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.240]   to show the prospective employer
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.080]   you've got the skills.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.680]   And for the most part, this is
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.320]   kind of fairly orderly in IT
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.760]   because there are certain
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.480]   certifications you can get.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.040]   And you get these certifications
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.560]   by studying, taking the tests,
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.760]   and then they certify, yeah,
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.040]   they've got the skills.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.720]   There's the CompTia certifications
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.760]   like A+ Security Plus Network Plus.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.400]   There's the EC Council's
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   Certified Ethical Hacker
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.120]   certification, of course,
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.960]   Microsoft, Cisco, and others
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.320]   have certifications.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.720]   To get a job without experience,
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.200]   the certs are the key.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.280]   But how do you get the certs?
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.240]   You go to ITProTV.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.600]   Tim and Don, the founders of ITPro,
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.520]   actually started doing training
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.720]   in classrooms for IT,
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.080]   for taking those certification
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.120]   exams, but they've really gone
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.560]   well beyond it with a modern
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.360]   ITProTV.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.040]   Streaming and on-demand video
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.240]   with every possible subject
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.280]   under the IT sun.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.760]   So you can learn, they have more
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.280]   than 5,800 hours of training.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.680]   So you can learn the skills
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.280]   you need. If you're already in IT,
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.120]   you're going to want to keep,
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.800]   you know, watching ITProTV
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.360]   because you're going to add new
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.040]   skills and polish existing skills.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.760]   You know, this is a field that
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.640]   changes all the time.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.400]   That's why we love it.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.360]   You know, the training you get
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.680]   at ITProTV is less expensive
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.520]   and higher quality, in my opinion,
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.280]   than the technical school is a lot
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.160]   less expensive.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.520]   Frankly, it's not much more than
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.120]   going out and buying a book or two
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.280]   every month.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.080]   And their instructors are so good.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.480]   Not only experts in the field,
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.360]   but they entertain as well as inform.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.120]   And there's all sorts of features
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.440]   you get with ITProTV
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.880]   that no book can give you those
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.960]   virtual labs.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.840]   So you can try out the skills
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.040]   you learned. You don't have to have
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040]   windows at all.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.160]   You could do it on any HTML5
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.800]   browser, even on a Chromebook.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.680]   You can configure and run a
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.480]   Windows server, Windows clients.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.440]   And by the way, one of the things
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.880]   I love about that, anything goes
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.080]   wrong and this has happened to me
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.600]   many times. I just closed the tab.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.000]   I love it.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.600]   ITProTV also has coaching,
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.200]   which is fantastic when you get
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.520]   the premium account.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.760]   You'll get a coach who will help
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.800]   you figure out where do you want
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.720]   to go with your career?
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.280]   Because there's lots of different
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:07.840]   ways to become an IT professional.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.560]   The their expert guides can help
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.560]   you set goals, implement a training
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.000]   program to reach those goals.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.320]   Microsoft, CompTIA, ECI,
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.400]   Council, PMI, all of the main
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.000]   certs and they have practice
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.520]   tests for all of those exams.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.280]   So I think it's always one of the
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.600]   best things you could do is to take
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.440]   the practice exam.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.880]   Then you'll know what you need to
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.600]   know, how you stand, whether you're
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.640]   ready to take the real thing.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.320]   You can also supplement your
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.080]   education. They do a lot of other
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.800]   things. Webinars featuring hot
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.880]   topics in the tech world, events,
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.240]   podcasts, tech NATO, Don Pazits
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.600]   podcast is fantastic industry
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.960]   guests and IT news and all of that.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.600]   They are also the official video
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.360]   training partner for CompTIA,
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.560]   which means they have all the
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.880]   CompTIA on demand courses, 12 of
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.520]   them to get those certificates.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:00.240]   That's really fantastic because
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.360]   those are the certs, the base
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.720]   certs that almost every job
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.640]   requires. We're going to do an
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:06.160]   event with them, actually one of
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.440]   their webinars in just a couple
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.720]   of weeks. October 1st, 3 PM
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.520]   Pacific. We're going to have an
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.800]   online panel. It's called Hangover.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.120]   What the world will look like
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.800]   after COVID-19. Steve Gibson is
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.560]   going to join me. Don Pazit from
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.640]   ITProTV, one of their co-founders.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.160]   Amy Webb, our resident futurist.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.920]   This will be a lot of fun.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.720]   We're going to stream that live
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.680]   and you can watch it on demand
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.320]   later. October 1st, 3 PM
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:41.120]   Pacific from the point of view
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.040]   of enterprise IT. How is the
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:43.960]   world going to be different?
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.520]   I don't think it's going to be
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.960]   very, very different after
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.720]   COVID-19. So ITProTV, invest in

[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.040]   over first. I wish we could do
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.000]   those in person. We did we've
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.360]   done quite a few in person but
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.840]   now we do them via you know
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840]   Skype or zoom and the good news
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.040]   is you can watch no matter where
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.600]   you are. Do you watch the Emmys
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.520]   on Sunday? Oh, there's there's
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.760]   something that's breaking. Oh,
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.280]   they just got tweeted out. What?
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.600]   Introducing Swift on Windows.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.760]   New tool chain images available
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.560]   for now downloadable from Swift
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.600]   dot org. Yeah. Now Swift.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.840]   If you need more geeky people
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:54.680]   think of Swift as being a how
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:57.560]   you program on Apple. But it's
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.000]   always been open source and
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.400]   it's always in theory been able
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.720]   to you've been able to use Swift
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.440]   on any platform. So now they
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.320]   have a tool chain for Windows.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.520]   Very interesting. Yeah. I
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.080]   actually like Safari for Windows
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.840]   one away. So yeah. That's
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:15.120]   interesting. Downloadable Swift
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:18.160]   tool chain for Windows. You
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.920]   don't get X code. Sorry. No,
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.320]   that would be that would be
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.120]   interesting to port. It would be
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.800]   an iTunes quality to wrap it up
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.200]   in carbon or something. Yeah.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.360]   Let me let me take a look at
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.280]   this. Oh, yeah, I can download
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.880]   it. Hmm. It's also available
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.040]   for Ubuntu. Sent OS Amazon
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.920]   Linux to so that's that's
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.240]   exciting. I think Swift's a great
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.240]   language. Well worth. So we're
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.560]   going to talk about the Emmys
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.680]   first Emmy award for the morning
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.840]   show. Apple TV plus at 18 plus
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.080]   nominations in the prime time
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.080]   Emmys. I thought Billy
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.880]   Crutup already won an Emmy, but
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.040]   I guess not. For us. It was the
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.760]   Golden Globe. Golden Globe.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.640]   Okay. Outstanding supporting
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.120]   actor in a drama series. He was
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.600]   very good in the morning show.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.640]   He was excellent. He was like
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.320]   Loki. Yeah. Yeah. He was
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.320]   them. They said whether they're
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.440]   going to do a second season and
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.680]   that I think they have to, right?
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:19.600]   I'm sure they are. They set that
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.520]   up. They didn't make it official.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.560]   Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston,
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560]   Mark Duplace, Martin Chart also
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.840]   nominated. I would have liked to
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.320]   see Martin Chart win. He had a
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.040]   very small piece in one episode,
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.160]   but it was good. I'm
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.400]   liking Hunter name, but the woman
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.760]   who was the victim in the last
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.680]   couple episodes was so good.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.440]   She was really good. Yes.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.960]   He was very real. Fantastic.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.680]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Apple won
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.680]   previously a pair of daytime
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.800]   Emmys for a ghost writer and
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.720]   Peanuts in space.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.440]   I think Apple TV plus, you know,
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.800]   I've kind of rethought it.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.560]   I've been watching Ted Lasso.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.640]   Thanks to you. I actually am all
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.400]   caught up. I I watched an
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.640]   episode last night and said, OK,
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.920]   that's all. I said, wait a minute.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.800]   You can't stop now. There's more.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.320]   I did. I got into it because
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.520]   it's very sweet. It's a good
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.280]   antidote for anything else.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.240]   You're watching. Nobody gets shot
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.080]   beaten. Just so positive too.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.640]   Yeah. Very upbeat. Yeah.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.720]   I want all of my friends to be
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.600]   Ted Lasso. Yeah. I want everyone
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.240]   I work with, everyone I talk to.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.320]   Yes, these sweet that. Yeah.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.800]   I'll be your Ted Lasso. I feel
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.960]   like they stumbled a little bit
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.880]   with some of the early, you know,
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.560]   marquee programs morning show.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.640]   Wasn't that great? See kind of
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:39.720]   flopped waiting for foundation.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.600]   I'm so nervous. There's a lot of
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.960]   pressure. There's a lot of
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.240]   pressure with foundation.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.040]   We're getting foundation and
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.440]   Dune Leo and I'm my nerves are
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.640]   wrecked over both of them.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.720]   Yeah, I'm worried about Dune
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.840]   only because it looks like an
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.040]   action, but it looks like Star
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.960]   Wars. They gave him two movies,
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.920]   though. He said he wouldn't do it
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.160]   unless he got two movies because
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.080]   he wanted to show all the
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.600]   intrigue and texture and politics.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.640]   It's going to take one to two
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.040]   movies. That's a long book.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.360]   And that's just the first book.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.560]   If you do the whole series.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.840]   I just need one for now. I'll
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.320]   take one. Laurie and I were
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.680]   trading Dune sayings back and
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.120]   forth and it just it fills me
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.560]   with all the feels. Apple TV.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.920]   I was just going to say, I think
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.880]   in hindsight, while they maybe
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.000]   struggled a little bit beginning,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.080]   which is to be expected for a
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.160]   brand new enterprise, they seem
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.000]   to they've they've acquired that
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.320]   Tom Hanks movie that was Great
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.720]   Greyhound. I think they seem to
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.520]   kind of found their rhythm.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.320]   They're a little held back because
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.040]   they don't want to be too
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.720]   edgy, right?
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.200]   Yeah, I think so. I mean,
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.880]   yeah, it seems like everything
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:43.440]   they put out. It's it's not that
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.840]   it's not our rated. You know,
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:45.840]   there's no there's no
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.120]   words. I'm guessing in things in
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.720]   it. Yeah. Yeah. They definitely
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.120]   don't push the boundaries too
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.680]   hard in any any direction.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.800]   You're not going to see a true
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.960]   blood or even a sopranos,
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.240]   frankly, and that's going to hurt
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.400]   them because that's what you
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.120]   might see as a pranos. You think?
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.320]   I don't know if you wouldn't. Yeah.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.480]   I mean, they they've had like
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.080]   see has a lot of cutting people's
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.240]   heads off in the first episode.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.480]   Spoiler is, but really minor.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.360]   I mean, if you were going to watch
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.720]   you would have watched by now and
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.800]   they were and Jennifer Aniston
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.760]   said more customers. I've heard
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:12.880]   of my life and there was a lot of
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.120]   swearing and I felt like that was
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.080]   just Apple's attempt to say, well,
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.080]   we're see we're edgy.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.120]   Sure, we won't put crosses on the
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.680]   wall, but we're edgy.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.400]   Yeah, I think that's that's part
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.200]   of it. It's it's not that it's not
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.800]   our rated content. They're just
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.760]   they don't they're not they're not
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.840]   being like extra, I think, and
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.280]   it shows and they're trying to show
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.600]   see, aren't we, you know, adults
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.520]   in an adult party and you're
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.000]   looking at it going, you're trying
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.760]   to hard to be adults at an adult
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.080]   party. Yes. Yeah.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.800]   And the other thing is that
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:46.840]   remains to be seen if they're
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.000]   willing to make the sort of choices
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.160]   that that allows an organization
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.680]   to be a powerful creative
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.760]   organization, which means that
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.120]   risking losing subscribers or
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.240]   losing corporate corporate
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.720]   entailments by pissing certain
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.840]   people off. Are they are they
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.080]   willing to put up that kind of
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.160]   show that, wow, this is just a
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.240]   career and immensely wonderful
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.000]   creative idea by a powerhouse
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.280]   creative team that is that has
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.480]   been turned down by every other
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.320]   studio because they know that if
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.080]   they if the characters in here
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.200]   are going to piss off the Chinese,
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.080]   they're going to get a rebuke from
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.640]   the Chinese government. And they're
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.560]   also going to get really, really
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.960]   hostile reactions from
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.240]   evangelicals. And they're going
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.480]   to be petitioned by this group
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.800]   and that group. But it's too it's
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.120]   too good a story not to do. And
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:33.520]   that does that's not that's not
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.360]   the necessarily their
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.600]   responsibility. But that's the
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.280]   difference between being a real
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.440]   creative force and being
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.560]   Disney plus Apple did a
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.720]   pro in season eight, they could
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.320]   do a redox just bring everyone
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:46.640]   back.
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:49.600]   Yes, please. Yes, please. I
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.760]   think the real test is going to
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.120]   be what happens with the Martin
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.360]   Square says a deal because they
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.200]   have what's called a first look
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.040]   deal doesn't mean that they're
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.280]   going to buy everything he does,
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.240]   but they have a first look at
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.800]   everything he does. So it'll be
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.600]   very interesting to see if
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.640]   that some of his edgier stuff
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.080]   can if you could see some of his
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.120]   edgier stuff. I mean, I don't
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.160]   know if you would Apple should do
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.560]   the Irishman. I don't think so,
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.360]   but maybe I don't know. But
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.200]   all the same remember that
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.640]   Netflix did the Irishman and they
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.600]   didn't sign Scorsese to a first
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:18.840]   look.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.480]   No, you went to Apple. But that's
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.160]   going to be so they don't mean
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.200]   Netflix doesn't announce what the
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.360]   viewership is. But if that had
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.440]   been I hate to invoke the name of
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.640]   the beast, but if that had been
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.280]   like Tiger King sort of numbers,
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.400]   they would unlock Scorsese up for
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.520]   the next two, possibly.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.680]   The problem was that the Irishman
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.080]   was a hundred seventy five million
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.320]   dollars. True. Okay. That too.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.040]   And Paramount said, Oh, and in
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.160]   fact, Paramount has done the same
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.240]   thing with a movie called
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.960]   Killers of the Flower Moon.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.000]   This is another Scorsese, which
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.200]   is based on the book. It was in
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.200]   development of Paramount, but
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.640]   apparently according to 95
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.480]   Mac, the studio grew weary
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.360]   of the hundred eighty to two
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.000]   hundred million dollar price tag.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.400]   Yeah, you can buy a lot of
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.040]   free South Korean soap operas for
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.080]   that amount of money. So well,
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.000]   it's Leo DiCaprio and Robert
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.040]   De Niro. So, yeah, of course it
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.720]   is because that's who's an all
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.920]   scary. Yeah. Right. Right.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.920]   But that'll be interesting. If
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.880]   you think about though, like, I
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.920]   think what Apple has done and
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:23.280]   will maybe do for a short time,
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.320]   but not forever.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.560]   They're reaching out to the
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:29.000]   broadest audience to right to
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.560]   capture them. So that's step one,
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.920]   right? And then you get into
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.360]   like Rosemary's baby. You know,
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.680]   you you got to you got to bring in
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.560]   as many people as possible before
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.440]   you start throwing the edgy or
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.000]   weirder, more unusual stuff.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.240]   And I think if you think about
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.880]   the way like HBO used to be when
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.120]   it was brand new, bringing in
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.640]   their own content, Apple is
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.920]   eons beyond what HBO was. HBO
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.520]   has just had more time to get
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.440]   where they are now. So we could
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.760]   really see that happen with
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.000]   Apple. That's kind of what I've
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.280]   come to is let's give them some
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.040]   time and they're there's moving
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.160]   that direction. And remember,
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.280]   Scorsese makes a variety of
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.480]   movies. You wouldn't put the
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.520]   Wolf of Wall Street on Apple, but
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.240]   you might put Hugo, right?
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.440]   Hugo was fine. I think so. No,
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.920]   I really the Wolf of Wall Street.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.120]   Yeah, really? Yeah, I think
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.720]   Apple is not they're not the
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.840]   Apple TV plus is not a place for
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.560]   family friendly stuff. It's a
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.920]   place for a broad audience. And
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.120]   the Wolf of Wall Street had a huge
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.240]   audience. So to me, yeah, that
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.440]   does fit there. I feel like they
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.760]   don't want to offend. And it's
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.280]   art. No, it's art Leo. That's the
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.080]   thing is it if they think a
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.240]   gratuitous, they probably won't
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.240]   do it. Although see, it was very
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.960]   gratuitous. But if it's art, I
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.240]   think that will they'll have a
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.480]   huge wath of flexibility. Like
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.680]   the soprano is calling. No one
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.440]   is calling sea art. No, but I
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.480]   think that's the justification.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.240]   It was like, you know, it's got
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.280]   accessibility and it's got all
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.880]   these different. Yeah, Jason
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.640]   Momoa. You like you can rationalize
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.720]   a lot of stuff when you're looking
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.760]   for get to high concept. You
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.520]   kind of lose art, right? You
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.840]   become all about the concept.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.880]   They just announced an order for
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.360]   a new Ben Stiller movie with
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.840]   Patricia Arquette. It's a half
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.200]   hour comedy called High Desert.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.160]   It follows Arquette, a former
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.720]   addict who decides to make a new
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.760]   start after the death of a
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.600]   beloved mother with whom she
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.880]   lived in the small desert town of
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.840]   Yucka Valley, California. She
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.160]   decides to become a private
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:30.920]   investigator.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:36.080]   Okay. Okay. Okay. It's kind of
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.960]   breaking bad meets Barry. I don't
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.080]   know what it's going to be. But
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.480]   we were joking they could do a
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.680]   Seinfeld reunion, but then we
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:43.360]   thought maybe they don't have
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:43.880]   enough money.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.240]   No one has enough money for a
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.720]   Seinfeld reunion. Also, we're
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.360]   hoping they can do better than
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.760]   just simply saying how old how
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.160]   old is our target market that
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.560]   that's paying the bills here.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.880]   53. Okay. What TV shows did they
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.720]   enjoy when they were right? Are
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.360]   any of them still alive? Great.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.160]   I bet we can't get a little
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.960]   bit dancing for Keith. Yeah,
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.880]   get dancing on the line. Yeah.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:10.080]   But for me, I mean, we're
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.360]   talking about Scorsese. It's like
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.520]   Wolfa Wall Street. Yes. My
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.280]   questions are more about if we're
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.400]   if we're talking about Scorsese,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.000]   like what streaming service is
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   going to not is not going to
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]   blink but saying, yes, let's do
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]   let's let's show less temptation
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.680]   of Christ or let's show. Yeah,
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.080]   that's again, that's that's
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.840]   there's also Age of Innocence. I
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.200]   mean, there's a lot of Scorsese
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.760]   films that are beautiful. Yeah,
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.400]   the yeah, the belong on
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.160]   it and the king of comedy.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.360]   Yeah, so maybe that was a little
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.920]   dark, but maybe maybe is it like
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.200]   Disney what Disney solved this
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.880]   by having Buena Vista having a
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.040]   separate badge that let
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.280]   they have Deadpool that nobody
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.400]   knows what to do with. Yeah.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:52.720]   I hope Apple can get a little
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:54.760]   more edgy. And I think you you
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:55.960]   kind of nailed it when you use
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.920]   the word art Renee because that
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.160]   Apple can justify because they're
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.000]   all about the arts, right? And
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.440]   they can say, look, they're
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.400]   going to make films that are
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.560]   great art. And sometimes they'll
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.080]   might be a little challenging
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.760]   or offensive, but these are these
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:13.440]   are not pandering to your
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.480]   violent instincts or your
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.000]   sexual instincts, but they are
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.160]   art. I can I have to be careful
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.080]   because they have a fiduciary
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:19.920]   duty like they're not going to do
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.240]   Charlie Hebdo, like I don't think
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:23.400]   in any stretch of the imagination,
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.160]   you're going to have to find some
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.760]   real boutique Hollywood house to
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.640]   do that. Yeah, so they are going
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:29.000]   to have constraints on how far
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.160]   who they're willing to offend.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.360]   But I think within those
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.160]   constraints, just as just for
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.440]   being a corporation, they'll still
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.800]   find excuses to do interesting
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:37.480]   things. Yeah, I just hope they
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.040]   don't turn into Disney Plus. But
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.600]   it's so I I I subscribe to it for
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.720]   about a month just just so I could
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.920]   watch the Mandalorian and then
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.840]   the the the the Hamilton movie.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.720]   And then but I watched everything
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.400]   that I could find on that and was
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.320]   to me it was just so bland.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.880]   There is a lot there is a ton of
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.040]   stuff that I could watch because
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.280]   okay, this sounds kind of
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:59.080]   interesting. Sure. There was
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.520]   nothing on there that was like,
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.720]   oh my God, I can't believe they
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.080]   got this movie. I can't wait to
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:03.480]   watch it. Everything we feared
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.040]   Apple would be. Yeah.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.600]   I'm in 100% disagreement with
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.040]   you all. I watch Disney Plus all
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.320]   the time. But because it's like
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.880]   nostalgia for the movies that I
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.320]   watch as a kid like the Apple
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.480]   Tumpling gang and things like
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:19.000]   that. So for me, it's
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.320]   fantastic. Escape from Wish
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.400]   Mountain and return to Wish
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.840]   Mountain and then the remake of
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.320]   Escape from Wish Mountain. Yeah.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.120]   Hey, why would you go back?
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.640]   Yeah. You escaped. Don't go back.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.360]   And I know I'm weird here, but
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360]   this is this is why like in a
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.840]   world in which there there's no
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.240]   longer just Netflix where there
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:41.320]   so many streaming services.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:44.120]   It's like can I can I when I
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.240]   took a look at this library and I
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.360]   made a list of well, here's the
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.160]   stuff that I kind of want to
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.920]   watch. And a lot of them were
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.600]   again, like again, Angela
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.960]   Lansbury and Ben Nobs and
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:54.120]   Prince and from six. But then
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.320]   but then I look, okay, here's how
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.760]   much Disney Plus is going to
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:58.520]   cost. Let's go on to eBay and see
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.800]   how much it would cost to buy it
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.640]   on Blu-ray second hand. And it's
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.320]   usually like five or six bucks.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.760]   Some of these are even like
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:06.760]   inventory titles, not that
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.880]   necessarily like the marquee
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:09.640]   Disney stuff, but it's just
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.440]   cheap DVDs you can get for like
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:15.960]   $5 brand new. And it just I made
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.240]   this. I found myself making the
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:18.840]   same deal with myself that I made
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.840]   when I decided to stop subscribing
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.200]   to anything other than basic
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.040]   cable. It was like, okay, you're
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.000]   going to miss stuff that's on
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.440]   TCM. You're going to miss some
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.560]   of these series that you really
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.680]   like. You're going to miss
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.440]   Project Runway, which you really,
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.680]   really love. Okay, well, you have
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:34.680]   permission to you do the math and
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.040]   how much does it cost to purchase
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:37.880]   this a season pass on iTunes or
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.160]   on the Play Store? How much does
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.920]   it cost to purchase this movie?
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.440]   And even if you buy it digitally
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.880]   as it as a download and you
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.640]   realize that, oh, I'm still coming
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.480]   out way ahead over the cost of
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.920]   this service for an entire year.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:51.240]   It's not we're as I'm maintaining
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.840]   I've maintained my Netflix
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.440]   subscription. And I'm actually
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.400]   going to like keep doing HBO Max
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.080]   because of all the different
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.280]   times where I've been surfing
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.480]   there. Oh, this sounds like a
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.080]   really great documentary. I really
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.600]   got to see this. And I kind of
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.960]   like want to have that channel
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.720]   surfing experience where, okay, I
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.640]   did not intend to be up until
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.960]   2 a.m. watching this entire
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.520]   series about the Golden State
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.680]   killer. But I cannot not watch
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.120]   the rest of this. It's so good.
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.480]   Laura, you said that your
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.920]   spatial sound in your AirPods
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.440]   Pro really is spatial.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:34.120]   Oh, yes. And so funny that we
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.600]   keep talking about C. I wanted
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.600]   to test it out. And I just threw
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.200]   on whatever Apple TV+
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.440]   TV show was on because I just
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.040]   assumed if anything's going to
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.000]   have it, it's going to be
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.440]   something on TV+. Right. So I
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.480]   just started watching the first
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.800]   episode of C. It's so weird.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.120]   So I had my iPhone in front of
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.520]   my face. When I turned, I could
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.200]   actually hear it more out of
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.240]   this side. I can hear it out of
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.600]   all sides. I could hear it more
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.040]   out of this side. Back to the
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.640]   center. I could hear everything
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.160]   centered when I turn this way.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.840]   Oh, that's wild. Hear it. It was
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.880]   so weird. It was like blowing
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:10.600]   my mind. It's coming through
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.640]   here, but it acts like the way
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.880]   when you're listening to TV
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.800]   like through regular speakers.
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.160]   Right. It was such a weird
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.440]   experience. I like that.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:22.040]   Yeah. I wonder.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:25.240]   So I wonder how they're doing it.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.520]   I think they're doing it with an
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.720]   accelerometer. They do have a
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.800]   patent and it's rumored that
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.160]   they'll do this for the next
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.520]   AirPods studios. There's going to
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.680]   be a U1 chip in it to do that
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:36.840]   kind of sensing of location.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.200]   I don't know if the U1 chip
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:38.840]   does. I believe it's
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.120]   computational audio. It's an
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:41.480]   evolution of the home pod test.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.280]   But how do they know where your
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.840]   head is? Well, they have a
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:47.080]   sensor fusion hub that takes
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.440]   all the readings from from
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.880]   gyroscopes. So they do have
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.080]   accelerometers in the
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:54.440]   AirPods. Yeah. That's how they
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.160]   know when they're stationary.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.040]   They can go into low power
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.320]   mode. I guess they think they're
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.520]   stuck on a table or something.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.160]   Yeah. Wow. That's amazing.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.440]   When you get a small package.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.360]   So yeah, the AirPods, a lot of
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.240]   people complained about the
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:06.280]   price when they first came out
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.320]   because it was based just on the
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.680]   audio. But when you crack them
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:10.200]   open, there was like a tiny
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.720]   Apple watch basically in there.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.000]   It's silly the amount of
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.120]   silicon that they put inside.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.600]   Ear earpods, basically.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.960]   We were going to we did this on
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.360]   iOS today. And so one of our
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.800]   listeners when our fans, he says
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.120]   he's a big fan is a musician
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.840]   named Jeff Perrin. And he's made
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.920]   an app. He does surround sound
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.200]   music. That's especially it was
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.880]   a graduate of Berkeley School
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:38.280]   of Music. And he does, you know,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.360]   music that's designed to use your
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.920]   five one or your seven one sound
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.680]   system. And he created an app
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.400]   for iOS called surround speaker
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.640]   check. And he said, it's an
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.240]   email saying, you know, you might
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.520]   want to recommend this to people
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:53.880]   who want to try the spatial
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.320]   audio. Of course, you could sit
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.120]   down and watch Star Wars or see.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.120]   But this is another way to do it.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.200]   It'll show you an image of this
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.880]   of the screen. And I did the
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:09.080]   5.1 surround on iOS today.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.280]   Now we're a stereo at best.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.720]   Most cases, most people are
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.320]   listening on mono speakers, but
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.160]   we're a stereo show. We offer
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.760]   left, right. And I gather that
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.240]   it's doing this with just left
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.200]   and right speakers. That's all
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.360]   you've got with your with your
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.800]   AirPods. But it's not decoding
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.480]   5.1. It's just it's just kind of
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.000]   doing it. And Laura, you said,
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.440]   when you were listening to iOS
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.200]   today, it actually did have a
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:36.040]   surround sound feel.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.080]   Yeah, it's I'm not sure the
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.080]   technology that this person uses
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.040]   in in their audio, but it sounded
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.320]   like it was coming from different
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:46.360]   makes sense because I don't think
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:49.480]   you have Dolby Dolby decoding in
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.480]   an iPad or an iPhone. I'm sure you
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.800]   don't. I was on my Mac.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.280]   Yeah. It's on my Mac. So it's
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.320]   somehow it's whatever produce
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.960]   like coming out of that sound is
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.640]   somehow matching up with what's
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.400]   in my ears. It's it's I don't know
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:06.920]   the technology of how that
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.000]   possibly works, but it really does
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.920]   have a surround sound feel to it.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.200]   It's a free app anybody can
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.760]   download for iOS or iPadOS
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:17.320]   surround speaker check if you
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.760]   want to test out the spatial
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:21.960]   sound. Yeah, so it's like but it's
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.600]   like it's a computational because
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.120]   you only have two ears, so it would
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:28.200]   have to kind of do it
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:30.440]   computationally. But I would have
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:31.960]   sounded like the information it was
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.280]   getting was from a 5.1 sound track,
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:35.480]   but apparently they didn't work.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.080]   Dolby at most if it has it.
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.440]   Like if it's available to have it,
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.280]   if it doesn't, it uses Apple's own
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.840]   spatial audio processing. And that
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.440]   just takes in the audio analyzes
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.480]   it and tries to determine where it
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.400]   should be positioned and then places
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.480]   it in a like a sound stage around
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.240]   you in that position, which is
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.000]   hella cool. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.840]   This is this is our friend Merlin
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.160]   man's tweet. You want to test run
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.160]   spatial audio on AirPods Pro,
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.640]   go to Disney plus pop in the original
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.320]   Star Wars and turn it way up.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:07.560]   Now I really want to try it. I gave
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.000]   Lisa my AirPod Pro.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.040]   Well, I'll have to get it off to
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.720]   borrow it and that's right.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:16.840]   On the one hand, having audio while
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:18.520]   you're you know, just sitting there
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.280]   watching the screen like seem like
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.640]   it's coming from behind and moving
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:23.080]   for you. That is cool.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.240]   But seriously, when you turn your
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.240]   head left to right, even though
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.080]   you've got headphones in your ear
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.000]   and the audio actually positions
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.680]   itself in front of you, you could
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.800]   be really amazed. Yeah.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:36.680]   Yeah. That's so cool. Yeah.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:39.800]   Spatial audio is the biggest the
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.360]   biggest buying clucking alchemy that
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.960]   I have ever experienced in tech.
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.560]   No kidding. Since I don't track
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.680]   pads. Yeah. Those are my ducking
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:51.000]   two. Yeah. Yeah. All your senses
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.200]   are a lie. It just tells you all
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.560]   your senses have always been a lie.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:54.200]   It's appropriate.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.880]   It's active and it's it's we make
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.720]   a bunch of assumptions and they
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.160]   can they can play with it.
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.000]   They can totally play us with just
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.320]   how our brains work. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:05.560]   I mean, I know doubt that the two
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:08.040]   speakers are sufficient to do a
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.280]   360 degrees sound stage. I just
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.040]   thought that you had to have
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:14.280]   some data going into those that
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.040]   told it were to mix stuff. But yeah,
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.640]   I guess you're right, Renee, that
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.480]   Apple's also saying, well, I'm only
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:20.840]   getting stereo data, but I'm going
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.360]   to make it surround.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.200]   Anywhere. I remember they machine
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.320]   learned like they just they
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.520]   trained it off tons and tons of
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.360]   music and figuring out where
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:29.960]   different sounds are coming from
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:32.600]   and front and dialogue versus
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:33.720]   atmosphere and all that kind of
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.640]   stuff. Very nice. All right.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:38.440]   Time to get to our picks of the
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.760]   week next on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:42.920]   I think let me think.
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:45.240]   Do I want to spend money today?
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:48.040]   Let me start with Lori Gill.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.880]   You are not going to spend money
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.800]   today. I am almost positive.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.480]   Oh, thank you. Oh, bless you.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.880]   So the Mandalorian, which
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.960]   everybody knows about, of course,
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:01.480]   there is a special
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:06.200]   full eight LP box set of the
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:07.640]   season one soundtrack.
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.880]   So that's on final LP.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.160]   On vinyl. Each individual LP
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.960]   is one of the episodes.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.280]   So episode one has the soundtrack
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:19.880]   from episode one.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:23.240]   It looks like it has a total of
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.280]   nine songs on it.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:25.800]   There's four on the first side
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:26.920]   and two on the second side.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:30.280]   And so it's they're called
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.960]   chapter one, chapter two,
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:34.280]   chapter three. So it's it goes
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.360]   all the way up to the eighth.
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.680]   The eighth.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.480]   Episode. Yes.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:43.720]   And they have like great artwork.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.320]   It comes in a gorgeous box.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.720]   It's really expensive.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.240]   Two hundred bucks.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.600]   Two bucks.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.760]   But you know, if you're playing vinyl.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.640]   Star Wars fans are going to buy it.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.760]   I bought it the second it went on sale.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.000]   So it's it's worth it for people
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.680]   who really love Star Wars stuff.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:03.960]   And this is the first time this
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.400]   soundtrack has come out on vinyl.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.600]   The Star Wars movies.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.680]   They were all the the
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.840]   the not prequels.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.680]   The ones that have just come out recently.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.720]   They all got a vinyl release.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.120]   And then this this is the first time
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:20.040]   that the Mandalorian is out on vinyl.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:22.520]   So it's it's pretty awesome to actually
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:22.920]   have that.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.600]   So this will be added to my collection
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.240]   of all the other Star Wars vinyl
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:28.760]   that I have produced in production
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.920]   conjunction with Walt Disney Records.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.800]   You know, I just saw a story that
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:36.360]   for the first time since something like
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.320]   1980.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:41.000]   Vinyl records outsold CDs.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.280]   This year.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.720]   What?
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:46.280]   Well, I can see really that's more
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:48.040]   a testament to how many how few people
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:49.400]   are buying CDs.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.680]   I think you see the breakdown of the
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:52.280]   technology Leo where they said that
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.680]   it's like even a CD reproduces more
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.680]   than digital music because it's not
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.720]   just dots.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.640]   It's not just grooves, but it's the
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.640]   non binary part from going to the top
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.000]   to the bottom of that groove.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.680]   And it reproduces a wider range than
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:06.120]   digital stuff does and just blew my
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:06.440]   mind.
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.120]   It's good.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.880]   This is why I'm master from CDs.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.800]   It's like completely uncompressed,
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:12.920]   completely unlocked.
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:14.680]   It is the purest sound.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:17.320]   I will occasionally spend 20, 30 bucks
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:21.080]   at HD tracks for these Pono player quality
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.040]   of uncompressed files.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.120]   But yeah, this is add that to the fact
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.280]   that I can buy a dozen CDs for a
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.400]   buck each on eBay.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.720]   And it's I think I like that.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:33.800]   But yeah, it's no surprise because
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:35.000]   people are actually interested in
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.400]   seeking out LPs, whereas people aren't
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.400]   necessary, really don't really have a
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.680]   need to get CDs.
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.560]   Although I saw the master chart and I
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:44.200]   was amused.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.640]   I was at least pleased to see that
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:47.640]   CDs are still outselling ring tones.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.840]   I actually still had like a yellow
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.640]   spike for like.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:52.840]   Wow.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.320]   Wow.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:58.120]   So how many of you have turntables?
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.880]   You must have a turntable, Lori, right?
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:02.280]   I have I have many turntables.
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.480]   You have more than one.
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.440]   Is it a microphone?
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:05.240]   Of course.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:06.840]   Turned tables and I'm like,
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:07.160]   do it right?
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:07.720]   Thank you.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.200]   Do you have?
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:08.440]   I do.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:08.680]   I.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.760]   How does that work?
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:12.200]   You have several stereos.
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.640]   You know, it's like somebody gave you
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.680]   a turntable for your birthday at some
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.120]   point and you didn't get rid of it.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:20.920]   So you still have it.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.320]   So you put it in the living room,
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.760]   but you actually have the good stereo
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:25.800]   that you use regularly.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.640]   And that's in the, you know, the family
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:28.200]   room.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:29.720]   But then you have this third record
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.640]   player that you just need to replace
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:32.760]   the needle because you actually like
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.040]   that one better than the one that's
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:34.920]   in the living room.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.440]   So once you replace that needle,
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:37.960]   then that one's going to be switched out.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.600]   So, you know, when you're, when you listen
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:43.640]   to vinyl, it's like getting, getting, you
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.360]   know, stereos.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.520]   Like you don't have one stereo in your life,
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:46.760]   right?
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:48.760]   You've got small stereos and big
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:49.160]   stereos.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.840]   You got your living room stereo and your car
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.400]   stereo.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.920]   I don't have a car record player.
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:53.800]   They do exist.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.720]   So vinyl records.
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.720]   Okay.
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.240]   Okay.
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:02.360]   That's because they cost more.
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:03.400]   This is in dollars.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:04.920]   That's why I get it now.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.560]   Vinyl records in the first half of 2019.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:10.920]   This is 2019 or 2020.
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:14.040]   This is from last year.
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:16.040]   So I have to get something more up to date.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.840]   But they in 2019, they sold 8.6
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.880]   million units.
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:23.560]   CD sold 18.6 million units,
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.360]   but vinyl records cost a hell of a lot more.
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.320]   But I can tell you just in the past
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.800]   couple of years, I've seen an increase
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.160]   in interest in vinyl in from a very personal
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:35.640]   perspective.
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.800]   I used to be able to press records all the time
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:39.960]   for my bands and you'd send out the
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:43.160]   music and they would press it two months later
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:43.880]   at the most.
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:45.640]   You'd had it had it in your hand.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.840]   And now they push back all the independent
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:51.320]   record makers that, you know, independent bands
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:53.320]   trying to make their own records because
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:55.560]   they're they're trying to catch up with the
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:58.120]   popularity of these major companies,
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.080]   major labels that are putting things out on vinyl
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:05.960]   again. So it may not like it's it may be unit by unit.
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:08.600]   There may be more CDs being sold, but there's
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.440]   absolutely an increase in vinyl sales compared to
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:14.760]   what it used to be just from my perspective of how
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:17.720]   I can't get a record press for six months now.
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.160]   And that's if I'm really lucky.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.760]   Yeah, I just got the 2020 numbers.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:21.800]   They've just been handed to me.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:26.760]   And CDs are down 8 million year over year,
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.520]   only 10.2 million CDs in the first half of 2020.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.360]   8.8 million records.
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:35.480]   So actually it's just a matter of time before records
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.360]   also outsell CDs in unit sales.
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:41.160]   Half of the best selling vinyl albums are released
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:42.280]   before 2000.
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.920]   So there's an nostalgia thing, but half of them weren't
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:46.280]   Billie Eilish.
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.240]   The best selling vinyl albums include Billie Eilish,
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.200]   Harry Styles,
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.200]   Queen's Greatest Hits, and the Guardians of the Galaxy
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:54.920]   soundtrack.
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.680]   You really should buy that on cassette if you're
[01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:00.360]   going to be faithful, you know, to the to the theory.
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:04.120]   So that's only 7% of all music revenue comes from
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:04.840]   physical sales.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:07.960]   So it really is more of a reflection of how digital
[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:09.080]   is taken off.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:09.480]   I don't know.
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:11.240]   I feel like I should buy a turntable now.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.920]   Just do it.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:16.360]   Put on a nice old record and just kick back.
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:18.760]   I remember the day.
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:19.240]   I remember the day.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:19.240]   Something.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:21.240]   [SOUND]
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:23.240]   [SOUND]
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:23.720]   [SOUND]
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:25.160]   That's good because you can relive that now.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:26.520]   Maybe you weren't taking.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:27.320]   Yeah, I know.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.600]   I don't know if I want that.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.400]   Forever.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:31.400]   You just weren't taking good care of your records.
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:32.520]   You just got to get them without you.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.920]   Oh, I had a dishwasher and all that stuff.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.800]   But I did too much scratching in my day.
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:40.360]   Andy and I go, your pick of the week is also music.
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.280]   I have another musical one.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.800]   I was bummed out at certain piece of news that came on
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:48.840]   Friday and I decided I was going to take a few days off from
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:54.360]   social media and just find peace within myself.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:57.160]   I saw that when you I saw your I was a tweet or something.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:57.560]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:57.800]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:58.120]   I saw.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.480]   Yeah, yeah, because I was.
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:03.240]   I knew that as soon as that news dropped that there was going to
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:06.680]   be a lot of yelling and screaming and mean people and mean news.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.280]   And I said, I don't want to have any part of that.
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:08.760]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:11.640]   Especially because I'm how sad the news made me on Friday.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.520]   That.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.480]   Her.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:13.480]   Her.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.680]   She has been passing away.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:19.480]   And so but fortunately what I had I had a really nice quiver in my arsenal.
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:24.520]   The Metropolitan Opera has been in in lieu of live performances.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.160]   I have been doing a series called Metstars Live in concert.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:32.520]   They've been arranging these concerts streamed live and HD over the internet from with
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:36.440]   some of their top top talent that works with the Met.
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:42.520]   And some of the most beautiful locations and this one that that premiered last week was a world
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.120]   beater and was exactly what I needed.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.360]   They had Joyce D'Donato put together an hour and a half long program.
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:55.240]   And not only she one of my favorite sopranos, but also when she puts together a program of music.
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:02:00.760]   It really is like going to church like in a really good positive way.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:07.080]   Where it is an emotional and a spiritual process because she puts these these these programs together.
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:11.400]   Where at first we're going to acknowledge that there is darkness in the world.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:17.320]   We're going to be singing songs of war and frustration and emotion.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:20.520]   And then we're going to transition and by the end we're going to be talking.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.920]   We're going to be singing about joy or going to be singing about peace and light.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:31.960]   And that's she had another program a few years ago in War and Peace that was had a similar sort
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:36.520]   of flow to it. And it was also similar similarly therapeutic. It's something that I have on my
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:41.640]   server and occasionally again when the world is kind of bumming me out and have to remind myself
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:46.040]   that the world needs people who are aware of all the darkness in the world.
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:51.880]   And yet continuing to create and seek light. This is this is the sort of stuff that does it.
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:58.120]   I talk about opera a lot and a lot of people are saying hey what's a good entry point for
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:02.120]   someone who is not really familiar with this would be a wonderful starting point.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.160]   Because you don't have to sit through an entire opera with a rest of the thieves like
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:11.960]   and so I go but I'm not going to find my horse. Your horse is right here.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:16.280]   You don't have to sit through you have to follow a storyline. It's just beautifully shot
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:23.160]   impeccably sung and their captions you can follow what's going on. And it will at least show you
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:28.680]   about the beauty of this stuff. All I can say is that one of the things I love about opera at
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.640]   its best and Joyce did an auto pretty much any time is that when she sings these really emotionally
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:39.560]   compelling pieces of music. I'm sitting in my living room. I'm watching this on my big TV.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.200]   I know that I've paid $20 to to access to the stream for the next two weeks.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.240]   And I know this is like Joyce did an auto but I'm like I feel as though I should
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:54.440]   I feel as though this is a really personal stressful time for her. She's going through so
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:59.080]   I really feel I should leave. I feel like I'm intruding on this really heavy time that she's
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:04.440]   having but no she's a character who's singing this song and it's just gorgeous gorgeous stuff.
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:12.280]   Like I said it's actually streamed live in Spain I'm sorry in Germany two weeks ago but the stream
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:17.880]   is still up and it doesn't go away until this Friday. So 20 bucks gets you access to it
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:25.160]   as many times as you want to want to listen to it. And whether you're through September 25th
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:30.680]   which is Friday and that's up until we have to say 11.59 pm so you know that you're getting it
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:39.000]   until until 12.01 am Saturday morning. Whether you need some peace and some spiritual harmony
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.280]   or whether you just want to listen to some beautiful music or whether you want to see
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:47.880]   you how I come how come Andy keeps nerding out over opera and about his favorite performers.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.280]   This is going to be a good 20 bucks for you to spend. Now what am I getting is it a
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:58.600]   because I see that it runs out on the 25th is a bit is it. It's a it's a it's a stream that
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:03.960]   that streams through any web browser. As soon as as soon as you've paid all you got to do is
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:09.560]   as punch in whatever email address you used as your email contact when you bought the ticket
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:14.120]   and you can just stream it right from the site. I had no problems chromecasting it and
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:21.320]   airplane it from from my laptop. I did I as this weekend I did decide that I'm going to have to
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:24.360]   capture the audio for this because I think I'm going to need to I don't know if this is going
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:29.240]   to ever be released commercially and if it isn't I really want to contribute back this is this is
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:35.560]   why I donated another $30 to the Met to their to their actual performers fund because of okay
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:40.520]   it's okay if I capture the audio and put it in my library if I take the whatever would have cost
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:46.680]   for a Blu-ray and give it to a fund that is supporting their performers while they are not
[02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:52.440]   being paid since March. So but yes you can watch it through any browser phone you can stream it you
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:57.400]   can you can chromecast it you can relay it works great you can't download it but you can work it.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.240]   I want to download it. I especially enjoy it the chief finishes the concert
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:07.960]   with the Jerry Lewis classic you'll never walk alone. Right I'm sure she sounds better than Jerry.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:13.480]   I think so much much better than Jerry and and there's also a couple excerpts from like cover
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:19.800]   of her Met performances that are like oh nice again this is why oh I just why I keep throwing
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:24.200]   my wallet at the screen but it only keeps making scratches and the plastic cover of it
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:29.400]   none of the money is going to the Met. Again this this is why the arts is such an important thing
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:34.200]   to support. Whether whatever it is that you really really like your local performers your local
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:39.880]   musicians your local independent music venues they absolutely need your support and part of
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:44.680]   what they they give you in return are moments like this that when you've had when you've had bad
[02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:49.960]   news that like okay as bad as a situation I think is in America things are going to get a lot more
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:55.560]   acrimonious and a lot more opportunities for jerks to prove exactly what a bunch of hypocritical
[02:06:55.560 --> 02:07:01.480]   jerks they are and you realize that I'm volunteering to be thinking about jerks and hypocritical jerks
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:07.000]   right now I need to get this I need to take some time to again find some peace within myself.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.880]   Your favorite music whether it's opera whether it's rock whether it's whatever it is will help
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:15.960]   you find that piece and this is something that we're all very very grateful for and we're hoping
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:20.520]   we can keep intact when we're able to attend live performances again.
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:25.160]   Nice that's a good pick I think I'll download that or buy that and then watch it tonight.
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:31.000]   I have a show that I will be watching the minute they start producing them and that's
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.960]   Renee Richie's newest tell us about this. Georgia mentioned this on Sunday I'm so excited.
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:41.720]   Oh I am too it should go live tomorrow I just we're just doing all the final checks. So Georgia
[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:46.840]   and I used to do a few podcasts together we had Zenintech and we did the original version of
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:51.080]   Vector together but everyone just got so busy and then when I went India I just didn't you know
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:55.320]   I lost all the Mobile Nations podcasts and I didn't really have time to start any new ones
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:00.600]   and she's just been going gangbusters with the psychotherapy because everyone is stuck at home
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:07.080]   so it's it's just people need more help than ever but we really wanted to sort of bring the podcast
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:12.280]   back and we're doing it a little differently it's still going to be available on you know Apple
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:20.440]   podcast pocket casts outcasts every cast we can find overcast you know everything but we're also
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:25.480]   we're launching it with Nebula podcasts which is the same as the Nebula video service is just
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:32.280]   they've added a podcast wing to it as well and so the there'll be a video version and it'll be
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:37.080]   better produced because George and I are doing it in studio together we have to work out some
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:43.240]   yeah I mean whoa we're taking all the precautions you need to take because you know neither of us
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:49.080]   have left the house I think in six months so you're probably safe well we're still be making
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:55.080]   out during the show or anything you'll sit six feet apart no she's married lady and
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.560]   you know we're being totally safe and you know I've babysat and things like that so we've had to
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.480]   oh okay we're in her pod but I'm not going yet but I've literally not done anything else and she's
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.080]   not done anything else so we're safe and safe can be and we're taking we're wearing masks back
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:12.920]   and for anyway there's a whole bunch of bruja over making anything these days but we're
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:18.680]   I'm scared to death of all this stuff I've becoming like agoraphobic almost so we're doing
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:22.840]   this down to the micromillum are you gonna do it in your studio or were you gonna do it yeah
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:29.000]   I'm doing it in my studio and actually I can throw a link in there because we have we have the
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.280]   unlisted version of the show up already I'll throw it in there I don't want to second and then
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:41.160]   give anything away here well you'll get so the point of the show is that we still want to focus
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:47.640]   on technology but how that technology really affects people humans and the first episode I talk
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:54.120]   about sort of the leak culture that has it's overtaking twitter and reddit and everybody's a
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:58.280]   leaker now and everyone's putting up all this stuff and some you can trust and some you can't
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:03.080]   but she was more interested in my own background because I used to do the leaking stuff back in
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:08.920]   like 2012 I just threw the link in the document I used to do the leaking stuff back in 2012 and
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:14.280]   it was it's a whole long story about why I stopped doing it and she basically forces me to relive it
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:22.040]   which which was stressful and interesting then we talk about sitting next to each other oh my god
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:27.960]   you're we might do a cross we're not sure yet yeah you have good ventilation in that room I'm sure
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:34.680]   yeah and again it's basically like Justine and her and Jenna Azerik doing the podcast together
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:42.120]   you know it's we we and sorry I was just I was just gonna say also he has this merch store open I
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:47.480]   was one of the first ones to buy when it was first I love the logo it's so beautiful yeah so
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:52.360]   simple he is wearing your hat what is this with this hat what is going on with his hat well it
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:58.360]   does the box the box does come with a slip of paper saying I owe you one logo we'll send it to you
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.560]   afterwards and you can see his approvals has been done tape it on yeah where did you get the
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.960]   here's Renee Richie's hat it's the same hat I'm actually wearing an apple hat in that video that's
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:13.240]   the one from the apple park store but this doesn't have a logo on it no the apple goes on the side
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:19.160]   on it's so sad and it's really subtle so subtle that we don't that's a company we don't have to
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:26.280]   market no no that's that's no that that is marketing saying oh only the only a really really
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:33.080]   expensive high-class cap has a logo this hard to spot once that have the colorful logo right in
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:37.960]   the front I think we're gonna have to make all our Twitter generic now from now on put a logo on
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.600]   the tag or something and map black everything Leon everything should be mad but I pick a tech
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:46.600]   story she picks a human interest story and then we just like on this one we talk about our struggles
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.680]   with quitting Instagram and quitting Oculus because we could no longer support the company but we love
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:55.480]   the platform and the technology so what are we supposed to do nice so it's really interesting
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:01.480]   and the nebula version is ad-free and has a bonus section where we talk about like cool technology
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:08.600]   that we're using oh nice yeah that's great it's called Renee Georgia and Renee Apple Talk
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:14.760]   yes the channel is Georgia and Renee which I kind of like well there's no name yet like well I forgot
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.640]   that you have to start the channel a month before yeah yeah actually brand it and then you have to
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:25.000]   get a thousand subscribers or something to do only a hundred but a month thing that I forgot about
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.320]   yeah but we'll we'll settle apple talk is the name of the old show I did with serenity and I
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.440]   pinged her and I said would you mind if Georgia and I used it she's like no of course not it's a
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:37.560]   perfect name for a show you're talking about apple and when will your first episode be
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:43.880]   tomorrow time alive tomorrow on on apple podcast and I and I guess all the other networks as well
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:50.280]   as youtube and nebula very good my pick of the week is my new turntable I think this is very
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:55.480]   exciting everybody should run out and get one and the beauty of this is do not get that you don't
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:04.920]   need a speaker it comes with a little horn that probably sounds so actually has bluetooth playback
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:09.080]   but I think Laurie jealousy does not become you just because he has a much cooler
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:17.640]   turns you know no need to throw shade actually my pick is kind of is kind of an interesting pick
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:24.680]   you might have read about this in a fast company turns out the boston computer society
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:35.720]   had great people come in including Steve jobs bill gates allen k and they made audio recordings
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:41.080]   of all of these they are now available you can listen to some of them for free on sound cloud
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:47.240]   including a steve jobs bit where he's talking he had just announced the next computer in san
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:53.240]   francisco and then went to the boston computer society bcs shortly thereafter to kind of do a
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:14:00.600]   second presentation to the club and so the quality is excellent I was very impressed they're selling
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:10.360]   it in with an em with a cd library binding but it's actually a usb key with 134 presentations
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:19.560]   200 hours of audio from 1981 to 1991 and I immediately ran out and ordered it because
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:25.640]   just you know just to hear allen k one of the best lectures I ever heard was allen k there's
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:30.840]   two different allen k pieces on here there's a couple of steve jobs it's really
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:36.840]   uh i'm very excited about it so as soon as I get this i'll share some clips
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:41.640]   actually currently unavailable it looks like they've sold out since I bought it so that's a bummer
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:47.240]   yeah since the fast company article I should say that this was what this the tail end of that like
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:53.240]   1988 through 91 that's when I was a really active member of the boston computer society before then
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.760]   I was a really active like attendee of these things this is such an important historical
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.680]   document because the presentations that a lot of these people were giving were they're very free
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:09.480]   they were very open they showed they allowed the personalities of these people to really show
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.720]   through obviously they were planned and rehearsed but they were rehearsed with the understanding that
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:19.560]   they were going that this is going to be seen by about 400 to 500 people who would then tell
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:24.600]   other people about what they had seen as opposed to this is streaming out to worldwide live and we
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:29.080]   have to make sure that we time everything down to the exact second and it was a really really
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:35.560]   exciting time where you get to see you'll definitely want to uh to zero in on you know the bill gates
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:41.240]   the allen k's the steve jobs is but you will also see a lot of people who were involved in uh
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:46.600]   no england's tech center that had just as interesting almost just as interesting things to say that
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:50.840]   you probably forgotten about and that would have been lost to history had these things not been
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:56.280]   preserved so i'm i had not known about this until harry mccracken posted his fast company
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.920]   article but yes i'm definitely i've got 60 bucks for that easy oh good yeah charles man
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:08.840]   thank you for recording these in high quality uh this is the steve jobs lecture from 1988
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:12.440]   at the boston computer society talking about uh next
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:19.400]   editor tom fricker and i have remastered all of these programs here's uh for research
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:22.200]   universities such as stanford and carne just to give you an idea what the quality of
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:26.120]   our schools like vassar and re like as well as state universities from california to michigan
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.520]   to maryland so ask them not for their list of specifications but for i think this is just a
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.160]   historic document that uh anybody who's interested in this kind of stuff uh probably would be
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.960]   uh good to have if if any if they if they don't make more available i'll send you
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:44.680]   i'll send you some of them from uh and i'll and i'll definitely i'll definitely find the guy and
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:49.960]   and send him some money uh i guarantee you that ever since i had no idea that these existed until
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:55.480]   harry uh promoted them and i'm sure that in the coming years you're gonna hear any time you see
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:59.720]   an article about a certain technology or a certain individual it's gonna come with a quote or two
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:05.560]   from that probably originated from these uh from these recordings yeah very very exciting i i've
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:12.200]   got my next 200 hours of listening mapped out as soon as this uh comes i i feel fortunate that i
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:17.320]   jumped on us as i read harry's article i said i gotta have that but but a number of them are on
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.800]   soundcloud so you can at least hear some of the most important ones uh for free on soundcloud
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:25.800]   folks we come to the end of this journey thank you so much for being here Andy and
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:33.160]   ako when are you gonna be in boston again i don't know uh although i might have a trip to boston
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:42.200]   coming up maybe we did our uh at tbh we did our first actual like call in q&a for tech on friday
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:46.280]   and it went real went really well we're probably going to be doing more and one of the things that
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:52.360]   we discussed is that i couldn't we came up we tried to come up with so many cluji solutions that i
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.640]   could actually see the uh the call screening system which is like how you see that okay the
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:02.680]   producer has chosen like the put these three in the queue here here are here are roughly what they're
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:08.920]   going to ask you and it didn't work so i basically had to get it so i basically fortunately i was able
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:13.320]   to do things off the top of my head so one of the possible solutions that if we exhaust all others
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:19.320]   is that okay i will buy a hazmat suit i will i will take the train into boston and i will actually be
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.600]   in the studio uh for this and i have to i have to admit that it's at least 40% of that is that
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:30.600]   i miss boston i'm kind of looking for a real excuse to go back just once so i can at least
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:35.000]   explain to the squirrels where the humans have been in the public garden that it's not it's not
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:40.680]   it's not you guys it's nothing we're going through some stuff right now it has nothing to do we thank
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:46.360]   you for understanding and we hope to see you again later on but yes uh friday at one uh is going to
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.720]   be my looks to be my usual slot uh and as usual i'll have tweeted out the day before right and i'll go
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:56.520]   on my twitter i didn't know you were a member of the bcs i was a member of b mug oh yeah at that time
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:04.920]   the berkeley macotas user groups nope and those great giant user groups uh really were amazing i
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:09.640]   really miss those in fact in some ways i think they're the spiritual inspiration for what we do
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:15.800]   on all of our shows is we know i will admit without getting into a long story that the
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:21.000]   reason why i've had a career in tech journalism is because of my activism in the boss computers
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.720]   society and if it had had had that gave me so not only so many opportunities to just learn
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:33.960]   and write and talk uh but also opportunities to write and get published and pursue a career in
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:38.280]   this and so this is this is why i kind of i hope that there is something i hope that there are
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:43.560]   resources on the internet that are sort of doing that same function and i'm glad to see i think
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:49.800]   that in the form of people who uh start off basically with an interesting technology and wind up being
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:54.920]   able to support themselves on youtube and with podcasts just developing a point of you and sharing
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:20:00.280]   it with people uh that's one of the things that i miss about the farm system of of user groups
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:04.200]   it was a big deal there's there's a good book in the concept of tech user groups
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:09.320]   from the 70s and 80s because from from thence though we wouldn't even have the apple computer had it
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:16.520]   not been for was trying to impress other engineers about what this funky little 6502 chip could do
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:24.520]   i should point out that the youtube also has some videos because some of them 21 of them were videoed
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:32.200]   as well as recorded in audio so if you ever want to see what a presentation um at a user group
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:38.040]   might have looked like there's actually some very interesting ones in here right brought canyon
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:45.400]   founder of compact computers doing his presentation uh john couch presenting the apple twoe
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:51.960]   mitch k-pore introducing lotus one two three gary killed all digital research i mean it goes on and
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:57.560]   on so uh those were also worth looking for if you look for a boston computer society general
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:04.600]   meetings uh there are uh 15 so far up but i think more are coming i hope so they say there's going
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:11.000]   to be 21 this is part of the computer history museums channel thank you andy lory gill thank
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:17.240]   you so much and i hope you have fun with your apple watch so jealous you got the red one that's
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:23.560]   pretty yeah it turns out to be no a lot nicer than i thought i was worried it was going to be
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:30.280]   kind of um too bright and it's gorgeous hasn't a deep deep red color to it oh and i like the blue
