[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Renee Richie is here, but only for an hour and a half.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Sorry Leo. I'm more.com. He's in Winnipeg and he must run, but that's okay.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It just gives us an excuse to really move through this show and people probably will enjoy that.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Wow, and only an hour and a half Mac Break Weekly, it's unheard of.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Anyway, welcome. Good to have you also from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Mr. Annie Naco. Looking nice. Boy, your studio's looking better and better.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I keep working on it.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Not now I'm working on the networking after deciding that perhaps it's no good to have a six-year-old
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Wi-Fi router because there are new standards.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   There are.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I should.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Is it?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Are there any 60-year-olds?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I don't know. I'm not even sure the router will have as five gigahertz available.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So it's like I've been testing and sending back routers after forgetting that, oh, that's right.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I should probably buy something that was made in at least Obama's second administration.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Actually, the newer routers do make a difference, but also routers one wouldn't think, but what routers actually would do wear out.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   They get less. I think after a year or two, they get less reliable.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's tough. You don't look at the infrastructure because you only notice the plumbing in your house when something explodes
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and dumps water all over the floor.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   When it keeps on working, you don't think perhaps I should maintain this or perhaps there's a way I can improve this in the last ten years
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   since we actually, since we had the last water heater put in.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So what did you get?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I don't know. I'm looking at a couple of different pieces of hardware.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   This is going to have.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   One of the things I've decided to do, though, is to move the router away from this big closet sort of space.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That's the main drop for Verizon Fios.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I actually move it to a more central location inside the house.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Before that, I'd mapped out a system of repeaters that would give me coverage before I thought,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   "Okay, maybe it's not quite so important that I have Wi-Fi coverage in the laundry room.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Perhaps we don't have to have that. Perhaps it's a better place for me to have Wi-Fi than that."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You don't probably have the need to do extensions and extenders and repeaters and all that stuff.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   One router probably get through the whole house, I would guess.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   If I'm clever with it, I believe I can get one, coverage with one router.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's a simple house. It's not huge, but it's not tiny either.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   But it's like there are bricks in certain places.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   There are walls and dead bodies and certain crawl spaces that have the...
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Bodies are not the problem.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   If they're filled with lead, then that would be a problem.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Well, that hiker had a lot of, like, titanium parts.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   But I picked him up on the road.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He was telling me about how he fell off the cliff one day and had it broke his legs
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   in four places.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Never again, I always make sure they get people that are not going to interfere with my Wi-Fi.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   People don't realize that Andy was the inspiration for Stephen King's famous misery.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Actually, I have a consultant credit on that movie.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Bad negotiation. I'm getting net points, which means I'm getting nothing.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That was two more countens had to kill.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Sorry to pile up in there.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Renee has to go, so don't get me started on.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I'm killing the countens for heaven's sake.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Ah, attack season.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Many people don't know, but Andy likes to dress up as a clown in children's parties.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And that's another story for another day.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's a essay.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's a essay.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You see a clown coming.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   This is getting really dark. I gotta stop.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well, now that Alex isn't here, we can finally, you know, tell us larger fruits here.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Yes.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Mr. Squealy McTalk to the cops.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   No, we're not.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Oh, finally.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Stop it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm an all you characters.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Don't get, I would say, maybe Renee, you'd argue with this.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Don't get the apple router, the airport extreme.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I don't think that's the greatest router out there anymore.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   No, I mean, if you really, really want time capsule and you just want to plug it in and never
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   ever think about it or you want that for a relative, then, you know, the time capsule is still cool.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But there's so, people are even getting, I forget the call, ubiquity or something.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   They're getting those sort of higher--
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Biquity's interesting.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   We use ubiquity here.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It is not for the weak, the faint of heart because the soft, it's complicated.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   But the ubiquity is kind of a middle ground between enterprise routers, which are really
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.520]   better than consumer grade routers.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.840]   It's kind of a prosumer router.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840]   They're not expensive.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.600]   They're about 90 bucks for the units.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.160]   They're powered over ethernet, PPOE, which is convenient if you happen to have ethernet
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   everywhere.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.440]   And for a long time, you had to run a server.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   You had to have a computer running the ubiquity software to use ubiquity.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.200]   But now they've made a unit that will do that.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.440]   They also have a firewall.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.840]   You know, Russell put these in.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   He's our IT guy and he's, you know, kind of a pro.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.120]   I've been thinking about using ubiquity.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.800]   I looked at other kind of-- there's attempts to make ubiquity style routing consumer friendly
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.440]   ERO is the best known to this.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   Yes.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.360]   So I brought ERO home $600 for three units.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   Very expensive.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   I was looking at that.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.320]   I like the idea of a mesh network coverage.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   But it never worked for me.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.040]   Also, they're recommending-- don't they recommend you have three to cover an average
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   house?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.720]   So you're in for $600 when you can get a kick butt modern router for about 120, 130.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.000]   And if you want one that's simply adequate for your needs, that's only about 70 or 80.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.880]   But we're in the sort of hell hole where people like us should not buy our own networking
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   gear because we're always thinking about a situation which-- what if I do have to--
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.240]   to do a four terabyte download of an 8K video file and I have to do it in less than a day,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.640]   like you will never, ever have to do that.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.800]   You're shaving nanoseconds off of performance here and you're spending hundreds of dollars
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.240]   and you're adding new cable drops through the walls of your house in order to make it
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   happen.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   But you get to Instagram the boxes, Andy.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   You get to Instagram the boxes until you bought it.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   There's more.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.560]   I think there's much more than bandwidth though.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.680]   I'm really reliability, stability--
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   Nutri-proofness.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.800]   Especially OS.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.400]   And let's not forget security.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.640]   A lot of routers are not ever updated.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.200]   Here's what I bought after doing some research.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   You might look at this one.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.040]   This is the AC3200 from Asus.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.920]   They make a new one that looks more like a red spider.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   Nothing.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.320]   What could be wrong with that?
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   Just like that.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.600]   The nice thing is this is running a Asus version of DDWRT.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.720]   It also is very-- you could put tomato on it and other router software on it.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.160]   So it's very open, which encourages me on security.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.120]   And I found it to be very reliable.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.640]   But it's got a lot of-- I mean, it's fun to play with.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.760]   There's like 80 pages of configurations available to it.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   So--
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.560]   It also looks like a Babylon 5 shadow ship.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   Well, this is--
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.280]   The reason it has 6 antennas, it does 2.4 and dual 5--
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.920]   this is why I really like it.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.160]   Dual F5 2.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.760]   So we have three bands as a tri-band router.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.560]   And 2.4 nowadays is so congested.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.000]   So many other devices use 2.4 in your house.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.480]   And your neighbors use it.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.280]   That when you can get to 5--
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.720]   and if you don't-- 5, of course, has more trouble with walls.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.240]   But if you can use 5, it's great.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.400]   And having 2-- I think it's 5, 2, and 5, 4, 2 bands in the 5-year-year-hood spectrum,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.960]   really is nice.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.080]   Really is nice.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.600]   And particularly if your router is just a few years old, it might not have a 802.11ac.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.480]   And every single device you bought in the last two years has 802.11ac.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.640]   And so just to get 5k and 802.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.680]   And AC is probably a good enough reason.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.840]   And also, think of all the dust that's been sucked into that device over the 5 or 10 years.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   It's hot and cheap.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.680]   Just a buy-in here.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680]   I really think it's-- yeah.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.200]   And well, now this is not a cheap one, by the way.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.560]   This is, I think, a couple hundred bucks.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   200 bucks?
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.600]   I think you've got to spend that much.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.080]   I think getting a $40 like this is not a good idea.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.240]   Not like how cheap all this stuff is based on what it used to be like.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.240]   Well, that's true.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.080]   It's so expensive.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.920]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.440]   But they've gotten so cheap.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.880]   I mean, a lot of people just go, well, they go to Best Buy.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.080]   And they say, oh, look, there's a $40 Wi-Fi router out there.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.000]   I'll take it home.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.160]   Which is probably OK until you get to security issues.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.800]   And Lynx has never updates it.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.320]   But they're really nice, hard to guess password, like password for a demonstration.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.040]   Yeah, make sure you turn on WAN administration.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.400]   Because you never know when you're on the road.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.280]   You might want to log into your router and change settings.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.960]   I just leave all the ports open for that reason.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.600]   Absolutely.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.840]   We're being facetious, kids.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.040]   Don't try this out, exactly.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.000]   Actually, I'm happier now with routers that don't let me do a lot, Leo, because I don't
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.360]   lose three days playing with all the difference that I don't see in my life where I just buy
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   it.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.680]   And if there is a manual, I throw it away and I plug it in and hope for the best.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.280]   There's something to be said about that for that.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   Absolutely.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.880]   But that's the devil that all networking infests in your brain.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.800]   It will almost all the features of almost all of your gadgets will work fine through
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   it.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.320]   But there will always be that one holdout.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.080]   For me, it's my Plex server where I just can't get it to tunnel correctly.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.640]   And I've been on every message board.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.120]   I've been on every website.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.680]   I've looked and looked and looked to see if maybe there's a way that I can replace my
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.400]   router with my phios router with a new one that's maybe a little better at automatic
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   port forwarding.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.760]   But I cannot get the damn thing to work.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.000]   And I wind up feeling very stupid and alone and afraid at the end of it because I cannot
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.800]   make this thing work.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.560]   By the way, we should mention that our friends at the Wirecutter and I really do trust them.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.240]   Recommend a very inexpensive router, $82, the TP Link Archer C7.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.760]   I haven't tried it, but they have nothing but good things to say about.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.560]   That's dual band though, not Tri-Band.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.520]   Anyway, we look forward with interest to see what you decide because I know you'll be
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.640]   smart and you'll do smart things with it.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.400]   Again, I'll then maybe I shouldn't tell you that one of the points that I was looking
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.880]   at was, well, if I'm really going to put that on top of the bookcase that's sort of in the
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880]   living room.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.040]   It should be that pretty white one with white antennas and a little aluminum trim.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.960]   We're seeing a midi-cozy for it and it'll look fabulous.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.880]   I ordered, I wish I could remember the name.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:36.160]   There's another company doing a ubiquity style mesh system less than the ERO.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.200]   By the way, we've had mixed results of the ERO.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.880]   I put it in my house and they say it's best if you have line of sight, which kind of
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.160]   eliminates the point of having the repeaters.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.920]   It will not let you pair the repeater unless it can connect.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   So I put it midway between where my base station is and where I want it to be.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   Nope, won't connect.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.280]   Closer, closer, closer.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   Finally, all three of them were in the same room and I had excellent Wi-Fi in my office,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.960]   but nowhere else than that.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.200]   At that point, I said, I don't know if this is ready for prime time, especially at 600
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   bucks.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.880]   Megan installed it in her house and it worked great.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.440]   Others, Kevin Tofel's done it and had great results.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.960]   I'm not sure what happened.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.800]   They sent me the first year they sent me, I was paired to somebody else.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.280]   So I couldn't use it because then they say, well, oh, somebody else is already using this,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.400]   so you have to have them release it.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.960]   I thought, well, it must be.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.240]   That must be some other journalist.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.320]   So I sent it back and they sent me another one and that one I never get working.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.120]   I'm not sure if they're not good or not, but at 600 bucks, that's a big experiment.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.040]   Yeah, that's when you start to think about, well, what if we say that we can spend $600
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.440]   to improve that networking inside the house?
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.000]   Is my money best spent on this one mesh network or is the money best spent?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.960]   I'm going to pull all the cables and upgrade them.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.320]   I'm going to upgrade all the switches.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.080]   I'm going to hire someone to do a map of the house.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.880]   There are a lot of things you can do with $600 that would probably do better than just
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.440]   give you coverage in the laundry.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.360]   Knock holes in the wall, frankly.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.000]   Hire someone to just drill, drill, drill and do all the cable drops.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.480]   I've done most of the cable drops myself, but there's some places where I've got cables
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.760]   snaking along the floor because I will hit a fire barrier or something and I'll have
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.920]   to like, oh, I should probably check the electrical codes to see if it's okay for me
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.360]   to drop down through this.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.320]   And then I'll say, what's the harm of having one cable snaking through the part of the
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   day or?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.720]   But if you hire someone, then either A, he or she knows what they're doing or you have
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.520]   someone to blame and or sue, which is really all you want.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.160]   I'm going to say, this is the one I got, which is called Get Luma.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.960]   It's not available yet.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   It's a preorder.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.920]   Very similar to the obiquity and era of same concept mesh routers, but considerably less
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   expensive.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.120]   Let me just see what it would cost for the three three units.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.240]   And then it echoes you looks fantastic on it.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.120]   And one of the things that both the era and the Luma are doing is iPhone or Android phone
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   configuration, you know, which is really cool.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.400]   That's something I'll definitely miss from the Apple Apple hardware because you just
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.480]   run this beautiful little app that simply tells you in plain English or even no words
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   whatsoever.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.800]   Here is the state of your network.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.240]   Here is what here is one here.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.040]   You've got three wireless routers.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.240]   This one is not connected to the internet for some reason, but the other two, your lights
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   are green.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   You can connect.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.120]   Yeah, this is half as much as the Euro, two ninety nine for three or you could buy one
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.280]   unit.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.320]   The nice thing about that you will like about the ASUS routers, there is an ASUS app that
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.640]   gives you full configuration capability from the app.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.240]   About other ASUS gear before, they're really real.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.680]   I like how they managed to mix high performance and not terribly expensive.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.840]   They seem to put the engineering, they spend their engineering money where it faces the
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.120]   user most most profoundly.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.720]   They did get hit by the consent decree for making routers.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.840]   They were a security issue just recently, but I think it was a couple of year old routers.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.600]   And I think actually they were chasing by that.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.200]   And that's one of the reasons they're using routers.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.600]   You can put new firmware on and then they have their own version of DDW or TASIS, which
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.080]   I have a feeling is just kind of rebranded DDW or T, but you could put your own DDW or
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   T on it.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.320]   Here's some reviews, somebody's saying go to some, we're really getting into the routers,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.880]   but you know what, this is some everybody has to deal with.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.080]   I don't think it's a bad thing to cover, frankly.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.360]   And I think Apple people will often just say, well, I'm going to get the Apple gear and
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.960]   it may not be the best gear right there.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.680]   Yeah, I kind of recommend against it unless you have very, very simple needs because it's
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.640]   really expensive for what it is.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.320]   It's very, very slow compared to what you can get for half the amount of money.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.200]   Its biggest advantage isn't, isn't even a time machine back as I think it is.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.320]   How dead simple it is to just plug this thing in, fire up an app and boom, you've got it
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   running.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.640]   It's not just running, but you've got really cool features running without having to diddle
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.800]   around with all kinds of web views and settings.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:09.200]   But otherwise, yeah, it's relevant that we're talking about this because Apple seems to have
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.120]   given, shown every sign of having given up on being competitive in the home networking
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   gear.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.040]   Yeah, they're really about simple rather than on the other hand, they seem to have forgotten
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.520]   they have the home hub would ever shift and then all the fans.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.320]   It was weird, you know, both Google and Apple dropped the ball on this kind of home automation
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   thing there on Google's on hub router.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   That's it.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.440]   We all thought, oh, this is just a wedge in the door and then they're going to upgrade
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.600]   all these new features.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.680]   There's all these antennas that aren't turned on and stuff and nothing.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   So I don't know.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   Neither Google's are Apple.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   I mean, they lose focus quickly.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.680]   They have so easy.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.840]   I mean, Apple was rumored to be making a hub that would do all your pre-stage, all
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.120]   your backups for you and all your software updates and work as a home game and then just
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.000]   it doesn't ship and they're on to other stuff.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.600]   Well, we have lots to talk about because there's a new MacBook.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.960]   Yeah, we'll talk about that and I need to I need your advice.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.880]   I should book run to the store.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.800]   It was a 404 this morning.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.120]   So Apple saved me, you know that normally Apple will say the store is closed, but we'll
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.080]   be right back.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   They had the page.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.080]   I wonder if it's still that way.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   Don't you miss those?
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.120]   No, I managed to order, but don't you miss those days?
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.080]   You know, so I went and I read all about it and there's a buy button.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   I pressed it.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   I got a 404.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   This page does not exist.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   What?
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   Anyway, we'll just watch.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   I was trying to buy the watch straps too and that wasn't working either.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.480]   It was just no button and some of the graphics weren't showing up.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   Oh, good.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   Now I can buy it.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   Anyway, I want to know should I and Renee and Andy will talk me off the ledge, I'm
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   sure.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.320]   We'll also talk about WWDC.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.320]   We have a date.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.480]   Lots more to talk about, but before we do that, you notice I'm wearing this lovely sweater.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.400]   You may wonder, you probably thinking, I know a lot of times people look at me and go,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.640]   Leo, where did you get your fine clothing?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.400]   You sure are a nanny dresser.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.720]   Perhaps you've noticed I've upgraded my look lately.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.240]   Look at this.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   I got another trunk.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.280]   What time to talk about trunk club?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.920]   Trunk club is such a cool thing for nerds because frankly, we don't like or we don't
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.800]   care and we're not interested in shopping unless it's shopping for the latest hardware.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.480]   It's like dapernus in a box.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.560]   Yeah, we don't really care.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.600]   So the idea that you could actually look a little sharp, it's my wife that makes me do
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.960]   this, of course.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.240]   And if there is someone in your life who cares about how you look, then perhaps you already
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.960]   know what that's all about.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.600]   This is a really great idea because it costs you nothing.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.960]   That's what I love about trunk club.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.440]   So what you do is you sign up for trunk club.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.200]   I'll tell you how you do that in just a second.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.160]   And then you get a personal stylist.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.400]   And I love my personal stylist.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.640]   She gets me.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.520]   And so she'll talk to you about stuff like, and by the way, it's kind of like a therapist.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.040]   I believe that there is a rule that she can't tell anybody what she's about the conversation
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.840]   she's had with you.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.360]   And so I told her I'm very fat.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.080]   She can't tell anybody.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.680]   And you know, you give her your measurements and stuff and she says, okay, we can help
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   you.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.480]   And then she puts up a webpage.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.160]   I was thinking this, thinking this and you do like hot or not with your clothes.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.240]   And then she sends you the trunk.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.400]   All of this so far has not cost me a thing.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.760]   She is a, you know, she's a trained.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.000]   She does this for a living.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.240]   So she's really good.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.480]   You can, by the way, go to the trunk club, club houses.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.680]   If you live in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or DC, and you can actually go to
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.840]   your stylist and they do, you know, have yearly events where they measure and stuff.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.760]   But this is, what's nice about this is not a subscription service.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.600]   I think a lot of people look at the trunk and go, oh, you're going to get that every
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   month, right?
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.840]   No, there's no monthly fee.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   You only get a trunk when you ask for a trunk.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.480]   And here's the best part.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.920]   Besides being handpicked for you and your style, you pay nothing until you send the trunk back
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.080]   and anything you keep you get charged for.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.880]   But, but that's it.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.720]   So if you didn't lie, if I open this up and I look at it and I haven't opened up yet,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.680]   we're going to open it up for the first time.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.960]   If I don't like anything, I put it all back in.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.800]   Don't even have to fold it.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   And I'll pay nothing.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.480]   I paid nothing for the whole process.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.720]   So you're getting premium clothes, expert advice, zero work, and you have your own personal
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   stylist.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.480]   What my stylist has recommended for me.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.440]   I'm not going to tell you her name because I don't want you stealing her.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.240]   She's really good.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.200]   Oh, there it goes.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   Okay.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.480]   Oh, you know what?
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   Nice.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.920]   So by the way, these are always, you know, beautifully wrapped.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.160]   And so I'm going to be doing a bad thing, which is pulling them all out at once.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.560]   But I asked for some slacks.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.560]   There's the Vince.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.560]   I like the twill.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   Isn't that nice?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.360]   That is really cotton twill.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.360]   Cotton twill.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.040]   See, they know because they know that geeks like us, Andy, we kind of prefer.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.440]   We don't want the worsted, although a nice dress pant would be good.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   Cotton twill.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.920]   Here's, oh, that's nice.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.080]   Kind of a Docker style Connecticut originals.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.280]   These are all big name brands.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.440]   Now we said I want some shorts.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.800]   And so they included some shorts in there because spring is sprung.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   Oh, bathing suit.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   Look at this.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.040]   Now, I don't know if I'm a mint kind of guy, but I thought, you know, why I should try
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.120]   mint.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.640]   I should try them in, right?
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.440]   Consider them in any way.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.640]   That looks like a good vacation combo.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.640]   That shirt and those shorts.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.160]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.560]   And by the way, she got me in a plaid, which I really was kind of avoiding.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   Here's this is interesting.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560]   Very retro, isn't it?
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560]   So here's the idea.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   I look at all of this.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.800]   I could try it on.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.360]   I get 10 days to think about it, return what I don't want, keep what I want.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.440]   And only then do you get billed.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   Only then.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   Looks like I got some shoes too.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.600]   Let's see what I got for the shoes.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   I'm going to shoot.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   I'm going to be coming to shoe haves.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.120]   Oh, now see, I like this.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.520]   I would wear these.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.720]   Hush puppies are back, baby.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.080]   Look at those beautiful grace weight.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   This is my trunk.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.120]   You can't have it, but you can have your trunk right now.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:10.240]   If you go to trunk club, T-R-U-N-K-C-L-U-B dot com slash Mac break, sign up, talk to your
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.480]   stylist.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.320]   She or he will help you.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.720]   You don't ever have to set foot in a store.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.360]   You get your own styles and all of this is free, free, free, free, until you say, "I
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.760]   want to keep that."
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.080]   And then you pay for what you keep and you pay nothing more.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   Shipping is free.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   And the stylist is free.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.680]   So there's no cost, no obligation to you.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.520]   And I think this, I'm definitely keeping some of this stuff.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.720]   Okay, be ready because you may say, "Oh, I want that.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.040]   Oh, I want that."
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.600]   But your style will be upgraded.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   I wear a lot of the things I got from trunk club.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.440]   This sweater, I love this sweater.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.080]   You know I would never have probably picked this sweater, but she said, "No, no, you should
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.160]   try it."
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   And I really like it.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   I think it's styling.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.200]   It's like when you can't choose what to watch on TV and then you just notice some things
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.800]   on and you'll watch it even though you wouldn't have taken it off the shelf.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.760]   It's a gift of opportunity.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.800]   I want you to try it, trunkclub.com.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   Man and women, by the way, this is something new.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.400]   Thank you for pointing that out, Jason.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.480]   I forgot to mention they do this for women now.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.640]   You know why?
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.640]   That was our idea.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.800]   Lisa said, "Why don't you have this for women?"
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.720]   She was mad.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.520]   She said, "You should have this for women, so now that's trunk club for men and women."
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   Thank you to say.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   Which one should I take?
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520]   What do you like?
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.280]   What do you think I'm a mint guy?
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   Really?
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   Wow.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   Wow.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.640]   You never, who knew?
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   trunkclub.com/mecbreak.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.800]   It was time for a new trunk.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.760]   Lisa said, "You need a new trunk."
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.160]   By the way, they don't send you a trunk till you go.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   I want a new trunk.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.480]   It's not like you get one every month.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.000]   She said, "I think you need to get a new trunk."
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   I miss when my mom used to buy me like sweaters for Christmas and my birthday.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   And it was never something I would have picked myself.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.640]   But like a week later, it was like, "Yeah, that's a good sort of...
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.960]   It goes right into the regular rotation."
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.920]   Sometimes you need someone, an external force to put to recede the random number generator
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.600]   that is your fashion sense.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.760]   I think we have a new slogan.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.680]   For when your mom stops buying clothes for you, it's time for trunk club.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.760]   They may not like that.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.400]   But we geeks need it.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   Let's move on.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   New Mac books are here.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   New Mac books are here.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.600]   So I was very disappointed because still only one Type-C connector.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.040]   Yup.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:31.520]   You know, HP's new 13.3 Spectre has three Type-C connectors.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   And it's...
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   Phil Schiller was really clear on this.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   Like he didn't...
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.520]   They were trying to make a computer with none and then they realized they didn't have
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   power it.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.240]   So they made it a dual purpose because if you're going to power it, you might as well
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   put as many things in that port as possible.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.840]   Isn't that kind of dopey?
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.280]   No, no, no, this is...
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.560]   Remember that they didn't replace anything in the MacBook line with this.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.160]   They added, they expanded the MacBook line with this.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.720]   And if anything, I've echo what Renee has been saying.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.360]   Like, over the past year, it's been really, really clear that this is exactly the Mac
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.680]   that they wanted to make.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.600]   And on that basis, you would feel less...
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.840]   You would think less of Apple if they just didn't think it through or if they didn't
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.880]   care whether it would be useful to people or not.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.920]   But you were really impressed when they decided that I know that we know that we're going
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.480]   to get slammed for a whole bunch of things.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:21.360]   But this is exactly the machine we want to make in 2015.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.800]   It's pretty clear from this update that they feel as though this was exactly what they
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   needed to...
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.200]   This was the platform that they could just put new chips in for at least another year.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.600]   And it seems to be becoming a trend for Apple that no matter what it is, they will introduce
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.320]   the whatever version of it.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.880]   And then there will be no hardware update.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.960]   There will be internal updates, bumps and software updates.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.560]   But whatever tooling they made for that first edition is what they're going to stick with
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.960]   for at least a year or two.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.040]   So this is their absolutely adamant that this isn't the computer for everybody, but this
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.880]   is absolutely the computer that we Apple want to make.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.920]   And that's one of the hallmark advantages of being Apple.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.840]   You can make exactly the hardware you want to make.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.680]   And they will walk things back.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   Like the no button nano got walked back when they realized they make a mistake, they'll
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   change it.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   But internally they love this.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.960]   I mean, you see these a lot on campus.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   People really...
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.080]   Some people jokingly call them manager books because you can't code that well on them.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.960]   So it's what managers use in developers or designers.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.000]   But for that niche of people and for the sort of forward looking technologies, and that's
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.720]   why it's expensive too, because Apple is bringing...
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   In their opinion, they're bringing future technologies to market faster.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.160]   And they're doing it as best they can.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.240]   But this stuff is what will propagate the line for the next two years.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   So there's...
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.200]   As far as I can tell, the outside is untouched.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.240]   It's the same keyboard, the same single connector.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   It's pink.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   You can get pink now.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   Rose gold.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.000]   This, by the way, is a must have.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.680]   And so in a way, I guess, by the way, I'm being a little disingenuous because a MacBook
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.000]   is actually my favorite Mac.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.080]   It's the one that and the 5K iMac are the ones I use all the time.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.720]   But this is what I bought from Hyperdrive.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.880]   It's like $60 or $70, I think $70.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.240]   And it plugs into the Type-C connectors.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.280]   One of the things you need to check for it has another Type-C.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.800]   Not all of them will allow...
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.360]   Other companies, docs will not allow you necessarily you to charge.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.720]   You want to make sure that it does charging.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.880]   This does.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.280]   So you plug the Type-C charger into this.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   You're charging.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.480]   And now you have power for an SD card reader, a micro SD card reader, and two USB 3 ports.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   This kind of...
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.720]   I carry this with me.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   So that kind of...
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   I guess solves the problem.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.160]   You really want the MacBook to be fair.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.880]   And to be fair, it does replace two or three different dongles you'd have to buy.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.960]   So that's not that expensive and you're going to have to carry something anyway.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.320]   And also the other thing to mention is that it's 2016, not 2015.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:45.720]   When I took my loaner MacBook out one week after it shipped to give a talk at a conference,
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:53.840]   I literally had to bring an Apple TV, a portable Wi-Fi router, a HDMI to VGA adapter.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.920]   So that's because the only way that I could...
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:02.880]   I was sure that could connect to the VGA presenter at the facility was to just do airplay
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.120]   to it and set up a private network so that could happen.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.080]   But now you don't have to...
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.920]   You can just go and get whatever cable you need.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.280]   So it's not as big a problem as it was last year.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.920]   And one way to look at it is that this is really the closest you can get to an iPad in
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   MacBooks clothing.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.680]   And the iPad has one little connector at the bottom and there's no real breakout stuff.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.080]   People have learned to do fantastic things and people are super productive and use it
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.360]   as their main computer.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.520]   And this is sort of the same idea.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.120]   I don't have one of those hubs.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.200]   I have a MacBook Pro because I do video work and stuff that wouldn't really work on a MacBook.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.600]   But I bought that because that was the best Mac for me.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.240]   And to Andy's point earlier, people lust after whatever is new and the difference now is
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.400]   that Apple makes a lot of stuff.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.120]   And not every one of those things are going to be for you.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.440]   And some people get really upset because they want the new Mac.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   No, but I want...
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   I don't think...
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   I think this is unfair.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.800]   I want that nice thin and light.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.000]   They could have very easily done what Google did with its pixel and put a second USB-C
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.920]   on the other side.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   And that would have been perfect.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.440]   A big improvement.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.760]   I feel like that...
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.040]   I don't have to drink the Kool-Aid and say, "Oh, everything Apple does is with the reason
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   and perfect."
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.840]   It could use a second port.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   Is there...
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   Well, it's not that they're not.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   What's wrong with saying that?
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.480]   There's nothing wrong with saying that.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.280]   And you do have an excellent point.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.720]   I think the only reason why it doesn't have a second USB-C port is because they simply
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   didn't want to touch the case.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   They didn't want to touch the case.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   Yeah, they didn't want to do it.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   Well, Johnny's busy on his sabbatical.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   Well, it's not in the campus.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.440]   And it's not even a aesthetic thing.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.120]   This is the device that we have decided to make.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.200]   We were committed to this idea.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.680]   We think it's a solid good idea.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.600]   Well, that's why I find an HP, by the way.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   Thank you, Mac.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   Well, thank you, Apple.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.960]   There's a lot of great movement here.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:47.800]   Looking inside it, though, I cannot see anything when I look at it with its casings and
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.600]   room that this is an ARM-based computer.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   This is very close.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   Whatever it's very close.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.080]   But aren't they putting the i7?
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.880]   You can get the i7 in this one, right?
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.120]   In fact, I should price it because I'm sure it's incredibly expensive.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.040]   But it's like the one they're sending out because Christina Warren and the Verge apparently
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   have some.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   Have one.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   Anybody on your side have one?
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   Renee, it does.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.840]   I ordered one.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   So wait a minute.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.240]   I needed it to Christina Warren and the Verge.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Yep.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   Okay.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   Thank you.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.440]   Look, I don't expect them to send me one.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   They hate me.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.560]   But I think at least you should send one to Andy and Renee.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   All right.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   So let me see.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.080]   So they set out the M5, which is marginally faster.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.600]   I think Christina posted a geek bench.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.200]   It looks like it's marginally faster.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.800]   But I can go faster because I can-- oh, it's an M7.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   It's not an i7.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.640]   Is that much faster?
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   Well, I mean, these are the Skylake versions of the CoreM last time it was a Broadwell
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   CoreM.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:55.360]   And it's-- I have a hard time with these because once in a while I bring my A9 and iPad Pro
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   around and I hear the CoreM's crying because there's a real--
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   It's faster.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   Andy's point.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.080]   Well, there's also this influx, which is getting really interesting, where a MacBook
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.240]   and an iPad Pro are not that far apart.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.000]   One's more a Mac and one is more an iPad.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.920]   But you can see architecture swapping that gap at a certain point.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   Should you--
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.480]   OK, so I kind of have an out here.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.840]   I'm not going to buy one.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:22.640]   But my wife, Lisa, and my business partner, our CEO, insists on having the fastest-- she's
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.720]   says, OK, what kind of computer do I want?
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.200]   You want the fastest.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.720]   So should I get her the M7?
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.000]   Is that going to be appreciably faster?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.240]   And is it going to hit battery life or is it going to be roughly the same?
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   They claim an hour--
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   I think the life is better apparently.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.360]   They claim an hour improvement, even on the M7, right?
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.480]   That's one of the things they get for free with a new CPU.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   That's good.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.240]   I would-- see, it's interesting.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:52.160]   But looking at all the specs and the data, I can't take off my annoying tech columnist
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   hat.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.520]   I just feel as though next year is going to be something amazing.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.720]   I feel as though--
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.560]   again, I can't get off of this.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   The idea that this was definitely-- if they didn't intend in 2016 to ship an ARM-based
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.080]   Mac, I feel as though they built this knowing that we're going to--
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.800]   this design has a life of about three or four years in terms of us revving it.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   It's possible that we will release an ARM-based Mac within that time frame.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:24.200]   So we're going to design this as if we're putting a mobility-- not just a core RAM, but
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.120]   a real ARM-based, intensely mobility iPad-style CPU in there.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.880]   And thinking about everything that you could do by having a mobility processor, not just
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:39.760]   putting in more power without losing any battery life, but also what happens when you suddenly
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:47.800]   can bake in all of the security features of an iOS device into a Mac by controlling everything
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.320]   from end to end.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.680]   I mean, I'm kind of on the edge of my seat every time there's a WWDC expecting an ARM
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   announcement.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.200]   Not that-- and this is not because I have any information about this, but just it just
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.320]   seems like so-- it's like shave and a haircut.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.960]   OK, this comes next.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   Two bits.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.720]   It will be so angry.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.320]   It's so angry with the lockdown ARM Mac.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.600]   It's really interesting to see the internet that day.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.080]   You think really they're going to do an ARM.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   That's interesting.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.920]   I mean, they've had it in prototype for years.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.400]   Apple's a really smart company.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.120]   They had Intel Macs in prototype for years.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.000]   They have everything ready for when they make their decisions.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.240]   Otherwise, it's too much time.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.040]   So which one are you going to get, Renee?
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.800]   Are you going to go for the-- by the way, 8 gigs of RAM and all of them?
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   I wasn't ready.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.640]   Either 256 or 512 gigs of storage.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   I top mine out.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.040]   Rose Gold, top of the line, Leo.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   You go bigger.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   That's what I got, Lisa.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.040]   1749.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   I waste the pink.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.040]   It's pink.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   It's a lovely shade of pink.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   You don't need to be ashamed of a pink--
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.320]   Well, it's been a problem because we both have gold MacBooks.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.760]   And I had to actually put the big-- I had a leftover.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.200]   The one thing I got good out of the Mac Pro is a black Mac Apple sticker, right?
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.880]   So I put that on my MacBook.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.680]   So I could tell the difference in mine and hers.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   But now she'll have pink.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.920]   So she's-- the Apple solved a real problem for you.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.840]   Anyway, so that says it will come in-- it's available one to three business days and it
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.400]   will come the 27th through the 29th.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   1749 for the top of the line.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.560]   And that's what you did as well?
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.040]   Elle, the Canadian dollar has heard a lot more.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   Oh, I bet.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.240]   Now, somebody in the chat room said that the graphics on the M7 aren't as-- that can't
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   be right.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.440]   Aren't as good as the graphics on the M5?
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.120]   No, it's got to be the same Iris until Iris graphics on both, right?
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.680]   I didn't have a chance to look at it too closely.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.920]   Yes, because I was too busy buying it.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.600]   I was too busy being frustrated with that buy button, not working.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.640]   404 on the buy button.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.080]   You know, I thought this is Apple's way of telling me, no, you've spent too much already,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.080]   Leo.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   Wallet protection technology built in.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.480]   Oh, we know how much you've spent, Leo, and you can't have another device this year.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:55.880]   Lisa called us yesterday saying, my husband is going to give you-- make a silly purchase
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.600]   based on impulse and emotion.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.240]   No, it's not any-- the intervention.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.640]   The SSD is PCIe based, which is good.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.280]   That's going to be fast, although I don't think that's any different from last year.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   The Intel graphics in the M7 are the 515 Intel HD graphics 515.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.960]   You don't buy this for its graphics performance.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   No.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.200]   Like, this is a computer that-- like, you know it if you want this computer.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.520]   And there's a lot of people who really want this computer.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.360]   You want a Mac and you want the absolute, lightest, most portable, smallest footprint
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.240]   written a display Mac you can possibly get.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   No, I did get--
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.200]   I did get the undercoating and the arm roll and the leather seats.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   That's right or not.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.840]   Did you go for ludicrous feet or just insane feet?
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:43.080]   Hey, Renee, I want to ask you, did you buy it for testing purposes or did you buy it as
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.920]   a personal production machine?
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.680]   So I did not get the last generation.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.520]   I had a review unit for the last generation and I have this panorrhoid about rev-A boards
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.720]   in the back of my head still.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.240]   So I said that I'd get one in the second generation so I could live on it for a long
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   time.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.760]   And I want to see-- I like to experiment with these things because I think people will
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.640]   have real questions about its viability and in different workflows.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.080]   And if I can test those and answer those, then I think that's something I should do.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.720]   So you didn't make the use case personally that this makes sense for your workflows,
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   your personal workflows?
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.800]   No, because I have two really different workflows.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.760]   Like, writer Renee would love this.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.920]   But there's also iPad Pro and I'm going, which one of these is better for me.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.200]   And I want to put them-- and I really don't know the answer to that.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.800]   But then there's Renee who has to do like still-- has to do a remnant video and other
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.640]   sorts of work that-- I have an iMac to do that now.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.520]   So I don't know if I need a MacBook Pro anymore.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.240]   So I want to sort of answer these questions.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.360]   Yeah, I couldn't be less interested in the Mac.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.600]   I have nothing but respect and love for the MacBook.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.080]   I think it's a fantastic machine.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.120]   Personally, Andy, you not go the user.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.960]   Couldn't be less interested in it because anything that any feature that I would want
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:50.800]   for the-- for the-- I'll really slim, like MacBook is served even better by having an
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.120]   iPad Pro.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.840]   And I'm talking about the 13-inch version, not the mini, not the free with the free
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.520]   with the new version.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.800]   I'm trying to find a word that is not overtly derogatory.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.280]   But after you hear me say it five times over six weeks, you'll realize that, oh, he doesn't
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.720]   really like the 9.7.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.740]   It's Big E Pro and Baby Pro is what I've settled on.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.540]   Big E Pro and Big E Pro.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.400]   The real pro and the other pro.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.960]   I'm very happy with the Baby Pro, by the way.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   That's why.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.400]   It's a great lot of people are-- it's such a sweet spot for people who just have problems
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.080]   with the idea of the 13 of a 13-inch tablet like that.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.480]   So you know, it's funny because I was talking to somebody who also bought one and he said,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.640]   you know, they're back-ordered on the keyboards.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   I didn't realize.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   I was lucky that I ordered a keyboard right away.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   Those are great keyboards.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.000]   I love that keyboard more than I like the full-size MacBook iPad Pro.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Do you want to write on it?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.280]   Because it is smaller.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   I do.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.200]   I think-- you know what?
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   I love it.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.960]   I love it and I didn't expect to love it.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.000]   And the reason I quickly figured out is because it's a smaller keyboard so my hands are sort
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.480]   of instinctively, I'm going to go a little bit more slowly, I'm going to type a little
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.760]   bit more carefully.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.240]   And I have an easier time typing on that.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.800]   The problem with the full-sized iPad Pro keyboard is that it is the size of a laptop
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   keyboard.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.560]   And my brain says, oh, laptop keyboard.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   Go nuts.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.080]   And it's not-- it's flat and the feel is kind of weird.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.880]   And so my fingers keep getting into trouble.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.720]   And so it's frustrating for me to use because I'm trying to type at full speed.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.240]   I never learned to type, so I'm sort of immune to a keyboard.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.680]   And I just peck away at any of whatever they're in front of me.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.520]   So maybe we'll say I never learned to write.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.280]   So I'm going to--
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.520]   I'm going to go ahead and say, OK, which do you prefer to write on the MacBook or the
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.280]   new iPad to keyboard?
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.920]   I got a MacBook.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.560]   MacBook's not great.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.560]   You get used to it.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   It's that great.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.200]   I'm sorry to say that I've got the-- yeah, that's a real failure point for Apple that
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:53.240]   they're not in any way interested in investing in really great keyboard technology.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.280]   It's always here are the limitations that we have decided to bake into this design.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.760]   Do your best given these limitations.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:07.600]   And that's the reason why I traveled with the My iPad Pro and Logitech K811 keyboard.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.280]   And I'm sorry to say that the K811 keyboard is better than the keyboard on my MacBook,
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.080]   which is kind of sickening.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:20.320]   It's a more comfortable typing experience on the iPad Pro, therefore, than on my $2000
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.000]   MacBook that I bought just a few months ago.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.680]   Has anybody tried that new bridge keyboard?
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   I'm not.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.320]   It's kind of a compromise, I guess.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.560]   It's a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.680]   I think it was a Kickstarter.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.920]   I guess nobody has it yet, so we can't--
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.040]   Bob in the chat room, Bob NLD says he uses the bridge keyboard with his iPad with his
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.040]   I-regular iPad.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.760]   He says it would be a good combo with the Pro on the site.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.280]   Down or I pull it up.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.720]   I have to admit that I think everybody has their own peculiar relationship because it
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.200]   is the physical tactile interface between your brain and the actual computer.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.600]   Yeah, especially for a writer, right?
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.880]   So I'm not going to pretend that anybody who uses the full-sized iPad Pro keyboard cover
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.360]   is nuts or is willing to settle for less.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.480]   For me, I just can't get my head around it.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.840]   It's a barrier between me and my creativity and the iPad Pro.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.480]   Otherwise, there are many ways that I just prefer the working environment of it.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   It's just brilliant.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   So many of them, when I'm trying to create something, it's so often just two really important
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.840]   app windows.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:37.040]   And it just lets me get a laser focus on the omni-outliner file and the Ulysses file that
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.400]   I'm using to take notes and convert them into an idea.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.320]   And yes, I can do the same thing on my MacBook, but there's just something about the clarity
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:52.840]   of the iPad Pro that just really just gets me going and helps me to write.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:59.120]   It's one of the best Apple devices I ever bought.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.320]   Yeah, I guess it's because it's because is it touch that you love?
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.520]   Like the fact that there's nothing else going on.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.800]   So you kind of constrained it's clarity.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.720]   It's the fact that it forces a developer to it's writing a really good iOS app, even a
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.920]   really good iPad app is a lot like writing a haiku.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.640]   You are limited in structure.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.280]   You're limited in size.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.440]   And so therefore you have to express your thought and create something of beauty with
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:35.000]   as much as little energy and as much clarity as possible.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.080]   And so that's why you can have apps that are practically as powerful as their desktop counterparts,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.960]   like iMovie or like Procreate.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:49.080]   But nonetheless, because there are rules that you have, the rules that Apple imposes, and
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.600]   also if you have any kind of a design sense, a wrong way to design that looks immediately
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.280]   wrong when you prototype it.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:03.080]   There is again, sort of a clarity and a directness to the purpose of these apps that is hard
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.960]   to replicate on the Mac.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:11.800]   I don't think I could get by if I only had my iPad as my sole computer.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.480]   It's always about having being able to run home to that Macbook Pro or being able to
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.200]   throw a Macbook Pro in my bag if I don't feel as though I can predict what I'm going to
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.840]   encounter on this road trip or at this conference.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.000]   But I find myself even when I'm at home occasionally, I've got a whole bunch of apps that have
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.840]   one-to-one counterparts.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.440]   You have the Microsoft Word for iOS, you have the Microsoft Word for Mac OS.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.560]   And given that I can just click connect to the same cloud version of the file, launch
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.440]   the same app, have the same keyboard commands, I find myself often just setting up my iPad
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.240]   Pro here in the desk and just using that as my writing tool.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:56.560]   This looks like actually this bridge might be an interesting keyboard because it kind
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:03.640]   of makes it more look like a laptop without the big clunkiness of the Logitech Create,
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.960]   which really ended up being too clunky for me.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.960]   It's got hinges.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   It almost feels like you're now having laptop.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.840]   It's really easy to separate the iPad from the keyboard.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.480]   My problem with keyboard cases in general is that when I'm reading a comic book, I don't
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.920]   want to have this thick wedge of something that is not related to reading a comic book
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   between my hands.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.280]   I'm still enamored by how thin and how light the iPad Pro is.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.080]   And it's kind of a shame when you put anything else on top of it like that.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   So the-
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.600]   But you're okay with the Apple case because it's so thin, it just-
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.480]   It's so thin, it's brilliant, it stays out of your way.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   It's not that-
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.800]   And you can easily detach it if you just want to have the comic book.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.880]   Experience is not right.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.760]   Although I often just flip it around back and just keep it on there.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.360]   More colors, more colors, more colors, more colors, please Apple, more colors.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   I've been holding off on-
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.280]   Do you want pink?
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   I want to-
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.240]   Well, no, more colors for the case.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.120]   I want the silicone back case for it.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.920]   But it's like I know as soon as I buy it, you're going to have a color that is not like
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.160]   Soviet Romania in 1967 style.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   I want-
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   In the colors-
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.160]   Blue, yellow, yellow.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.160]   Yes, yes.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   Pink, I will take pink.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.560]   Just don't call it rose gold, call it pink and I will buy it.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.360]   You know, it's funny because Microsoft has just announced that they're going to-
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.640]   And they made a big Apple-y kind of video around it, offer the type keyboards for the
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.520]   Surface Pro in a cantara.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.000]   A cantara.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   And it's-
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.240]   Which is basically a synthetic fiber that feels a bit like suede.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.520]   But in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was a cantara.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.520]   But because it feels kind of sweaty.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.240]   They're keyboard covers are brilliant.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   Are they?
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.640]   They've got keyboard covers that are about as good as the one on the MacBook nothing.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.760]   So it's not deep travel, but it's really-
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.120]   It's a true mechanical keyboard.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.320]   It's a true big trackpad underneath it.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.640]   And having used the Surface Pro 4 for a couple of months with it, I feel as though I really
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:11.000]   could- It really does cash that check that Microsoft's been making saying that this is
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.320]   the Surface Pro 4.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.760]   It's a tablet, but it's also as good as a laptop.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.600]   But not- And we're not saying given certain things you have to adjust to.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.240]   No, it is Windows 10, whatever you do on your regular laptop you can use on this tablet.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.960]   And part of it is just having this really brilliant keyboard cover that I could work
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.720]   for an entire afternoon on.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   Wouldn't be my favorite keyboard, just like the MacBook nothing keyboard is in my favorite
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   keyboard.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.680]   But I can certainly do a whole afternoon's work on it.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:43.840]   Tell me who made this ad.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.400]   We believe in making everyday objects beautiful.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.240]   The Surface is an example of best-
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.080]   Oh, that's kind of a given one.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.800]   Then as the device we'd personally recommend it was something that really kind of touches
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.760]   your heart, that touches you as a person.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.960]   They had the same costumers that I came up with for a long time.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.320]   It's really stylish people's colors.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   Who in the world of materials is really top of the line?
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   So, how can Tara is born and made in Italy?
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   There's no other material like it in the market that's never going to be-
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   I think you're gonna get that to a date.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.320]   If you look at that-
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.320]   You have to have somebody with an accent.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   You have to have these colors subtly have this kind of stuff.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.920]   No, on a tree, on a pine tree, a parbling group.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.760]   An engineer came to work in a various green hoodie.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   He made him go home and changed.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   He's made from the dawns of dinosaur and old leaves compressed over a million years.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.760]   It is tears of unicorn.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   The same time, creates a very-
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   I was always wondering if Portia Design would do a version of the Surface and just call it
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   like dust surface, titanium dust.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   It's-
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   Oh, sorry, I'm not-
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   *gasp*
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   *gasp*
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   Oh.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   *laughing*
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   It's a significant issue.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   Now we're making fun of it, but if this were part of an Apple theme-
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   Where for word, every people-
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   *laughing*
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   It's not that-
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   People ever show the outdoors in their commercials, though I think that was a good one.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   They even have the chorus in the background going, "Haaaa!"
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   I think that's why they're working on the Spaceship Campus.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   They don't feel as though the outdoors as envisioned by outsiders is up to Apple standards.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   They can build an outdoors that will be worthy of Apple products.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   Apple revolutionizes the outdoors.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   We make no outdoors-
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   The funniest outdoors we've ever made.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.760]   The one thing we're mentioning in all of this is we haven't seen the new MacBook Pros yet either,
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.760]   and we should see those this summer.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   So if you're on the-
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   If you're at all considering not to-
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   What MacBook to get, wait, and maybe one of the new MacBook Pros will be more of your liking.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.760]   And those will also-
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   I mean, presumably they're gonna do Skylake across the line, right?
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   I don't think it'll be like-
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   It'll be ready in time.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   No.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   Wouldn't it be funny if they just skipped Skylake on the Pro?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   People thought they were gonna skip-
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   I mean, people thought they were gonna skip Broadwell, and they thought they were gonna skip Sky.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   I mean, Intel Roadmap is so full of potholes right now that it's interesting to see.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   They make great stuff.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   It's great because you get so many things for free when you just pop out one CPU and pop in a new one, but-
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.760]   Yeah, I mean, you can't count on anything.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   I've been telling people that if they've been holding out based on their-
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   I want the new CPUs.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   Don't hold out past your next project deadline because it might be next week.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   It might be the summer.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.760]   It might be after the summer.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.760]   You just don't know when you're talking about an Intel production-
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   And they'll ship it, but it won't have the IRIS graphics that Apple wants,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   and they'll wait on that.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   The new MacBook support USB 3.1, right?
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.760]   And the Type-C connector.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   Is it Thunderbolt 3 as well?
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   No.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   Don't.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   Connector, no.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   Okay.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   Same architecture, basically, just the new chipsets.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   Okay.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   And the same physical hardware, it's pretty- except for pink, but it's pretty much-
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   It's the same keyboard, the same screen, the same retinus display.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.760]   And if you were to look at it like a processor bumpy and a new color option,
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   you wouldn't be wrong.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   That's basically it.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   And how about the air?
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   Is this- I mean, this is now- I understand crystal ball reading,
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   but you think new pros with these skylight chips,
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   how about new airs with the skylight chips?
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   Or is it really-
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   The air's got bumped- well, they didn't get bumped, but they got set to 8 megabyte standard.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   They got new- everybody's gonna start at eight.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   And I mean, they still can't- they fit- with Apple's margins,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   they cannot make a MacBook that hits that $900 price point,
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   which is what they want their entry-level MacBooks to be.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   So the air is safe until all those components come down in price.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.760]   I wonder why the 2015 MacBook doesn't have Thunderbolt 3.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   Doesn't skylight support that directly in the chipset?
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   I believe it does.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   NIOs in it saying so in their chat room.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   And they have that new- it's basically the identical interconnect,
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   so it looks the same as the USB-C connector, it just adds the Apple 3 to the mix.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   But whether the core M version that Apple is using in here supports it or not,
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   whether they had to do other architectural things that they chose not to do,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   it's hard to say.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   Well, apparently they've seeded some people with the new MacBooks,
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   so we're starting to see early reviews.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   The Verge looks like Christina Warren.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   We tried to get Christina on, by the way, which is not available at this moment.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   We are seeing Geekbench scores for what is called the MacBook 9,1.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   That is the internal name, the 2016 MacBook.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.760]   This is the M5 score, single-core 2670.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   These are dual-core now, right?
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   It's multi-core score, 52.52.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   So it's a very small increase from last year.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   That's a minor increase.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   And they're not really taking advantage of things like Thunderbolt 3 that come with skylight,
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   although they are taking advantage of better battery life.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   It's an efficiency.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   I mean, Intel's mobile roadmap hasn't been about massive performance increases for a
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   long time.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   It's been about power efficiency.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   Right.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.760]   And if you look at the iPad Pro, I mean, the iPad Pro, I think, is around 3,250, 500.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   That'll give you an idea of what Apple's managing to push out in a similar class device.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   So much of that work is just about heat management.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   We're not talking about speed.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   We're not even talking about power.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.760]   So much of it is just about how do we...
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   How can we create something that can support a modern mobile operating system or a modern
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   desktop operating system can fit in the small amount of space that is being given to us,
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.760]   but will not require significant heat sink and will not require a fan.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   And that is the alchemy that is behind the scenes magic that so many people spend so
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   much of their lives trying to solve it until.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   Now, I don't want to run Windows 10 on my new HP.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   So I'm probably going to run Linux on it.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   I wish I could run Mac OS.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   But there you have it.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   They're putting three Type C's on the back here.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   You just feel...
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   That just sounds like one of those hippies that buys a Jaguar and then puts in the garage
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   for two months when it comes out at like burns used cooking oil for fuel.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   It's like the most gorgeous thing, but you've got to put something like this.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   I think Linux is ready.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   I think it's time.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   This is the year of desktop Linux.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   Laptop Linux, and I think that this specter, if I can get Linux running on it, who knows,
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   by the way, the law of averages simply dictates that one of these years, this will be the
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   year of Linux if you just keep making it, insisting that this is the year of Linux.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   In a different world, this would have run WebOS Leo.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   Think about it.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   The possibilities are endless.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   Incidentally, not a retina display.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   It's 13.3 inches, but only 1080p, which is going to give it, I think, better battery life
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   than the MacBook.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.760]   It's thinner than the MacBook.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   I don't know if it's lighter.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   It's 2.45 pounds.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   I think that's heavier, isn't it?
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   It's the gold plating.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   It's copper.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   Sorry, bronze.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   Bronze.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   Bronze age.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   It's bronze.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.160]   I vowed years ago never to buy another HP laptop.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.160]   So there you go.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.720]   It shows you how far I've fallen.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   They do come with...
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.160]   It does have an available silver bronze Bluetooth mouse.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.560]   Does it come in pink?
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   No, bronze!
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.560]   Hey, I know.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.960]   Actually, they're doing something weird.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:19.680]   I think there's a lottery because there's two specially designed ones by artists.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.520]   And if you can get in a lottery, you could be one of the 500 or something to spend probably
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.360]   an ungodly sum.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:31.440]   This is also a very, very appily ad for their new HP laptop.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.560]   It has the same kind of chorus and people with European voices.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.800]   They spelled "spector" correctly.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   And "spector" with an RE.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   "spector notebook" is the best notebook in the world.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   "spector notebook" is a great name.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:55.560]   I swear to God, this is a complete copy in the MacBook that we've ever made.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:00.440]   Best notebook we've ever made is a marriage of engineering and design.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.440]   Points are on the back.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.760]   Oh my God, it's a clockwork computer.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.760]   It's a clockwork.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   It has a little bit of a...
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   It's a steam clock.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   And I love three.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   I'm going to do just for the three USB.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.880]   Wow, it's made of chocolate.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.760]   We wanted it to feel like we were able to share it.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.320]   That's a regional bias.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   It is more artist.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.880]   They needed a guy with a language.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.120]   It looks as if a craftsman made just one.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   Oh, it's the Eames chair.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.040]   It's the Eames chair of laptops.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.040]   Hit it out of friends.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.160]   What a terrible responsibility they've dropped onto all these engineers that have...
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.640]   All these engineers that have...
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.720]   Historically, we come in, we do our job, we get screwed over by management.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.720]   We still manage to do what we can do.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.520]   But now we have to be on a video saying that we've created this gorgeous work of art as
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:47.360]   opposed to functionally solving some problems under the constraints we were given.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   Please.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   I'm going to need another grand.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.920]   I'm not going to show up at the studio and say...
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:55:00.200]   The chamferang group speaks of the interface between the mind and the screen.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.840]   The best spoke keyboard.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   Yes.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.440]   This uses USB-C, the next generation.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   USB-C.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.360]   Each of these is not only data in and data out.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   I wonder how long it will be before we actually see USB on an iPad.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.960]   I'm reorganizing the cabinet that I put all my cables and stuff in.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.600]   This is the first time I actually had to create a brand new drawer just for USB-C cables
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.280]   and adapters and stuff like that.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:34.200]   And now Micro USB is just this drawer of hundreds of crap cables that I rarely use anymore,
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.040]   whether for my Android device or my iOS devices.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.640]   It can be more important as we go.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.960]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:42.960]   I'll get...
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.280]   This is almost the same cost.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.760]   In fact, I think it's exactly the same cost.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:51.080]   So I'll get this, but I just can't bring myself to run.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.720]   Fingerprints is 10.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.920]   That's fingerprints on that thing.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   I was going to be way worse than on that.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:02.200]   In fact, they said we knew that, but we decided we were to do it anyway.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:07.640]   Each one adapts to the identity of the user in a profound and subtle way.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   We promise.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.400]   Hey, look at me, I'm a copywriter.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   I know we're...
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   I'm sure Andy...
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.560]   They don't give a lot of information on this, and it is not available for sale now.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.680]   I don't know if it does Thunderbolt 3 or not.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.880]   I'd be curious to see.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:29.480]   By the way, Lassie is offering now a Thunderbolt 3 or a right disc array.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.840]   I don't know what you're supposed to use it with, but...
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.120]   Your dreams, Leo.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.920]   Perhaps the new MacBook Pros when they come out.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Is it interesting?
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.040]   I'm sure it's also the M. Yeah, it's the sixth generation Core-I processor.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.400]   What wait a minute, is that an M or is that an I?
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.480]   Core-I processor, yeah.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.240]   That's the full baby.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240]   Full Monty.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.240]   Full Monty.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.240]   All right.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:02.480]   Thunderbolt 8 at transfer speeds of 40 gigabits.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.480]   That's two, right?
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.840]   That's Thunderbolt 2 or is it 3?
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.240]   I think 40 is 2.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.240]   It's two lanes at 20.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.240]   Right.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:16.800]   I'm going to just try it, and if I can get Linux on it, then I won't be too unhappy.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.640]   I ordered mine immediately, Leo, and then I added the faux band from Hermes just to
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   talk to me.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   I'm on faux.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   I'm on faux.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   I'm on faux.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   All right.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   We're going to take a break.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   Come back with more.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:34.400]   Renee Richie, Andy and Naco, we're talking Macintosh and a little HP thrown in.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.840]   Sorry about that.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   And let's see here.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.880]   I showed today brought to you by people who love magazines.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   You know what?
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.280]   Magazines are still.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.520]   That's the one thing the web hasn't replaced exactly as magazines.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:54.240]   There's something about all the beautiful images and the articles.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.920]   Every month there's an article, I just, you know, kind of long form article.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:03.360]   I just want to read in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, of course.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.280]   I was really pleased when we got an advertiser called Next Issue.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   They're now texture.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.360]   They've rebranded.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.840]   And they do for magazines, what Netflix did for movies.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:17.360]   You can now binge read your magazines, one low monthly rate, and you get all of these
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.400]   magazines, all the ones I mentioned and many, many more.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.960]   And they're on your iPad or your iPhone or any other tablet or device they have Android
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.520]   as well.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.720]   And the best magazines, and you don't have to buy just, you know, an issue on the news
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.920]   stand just for that one article.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.360]   The images look better than they do on the magazine because on the Retina display they're
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.360]   gorgeous.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:43.640]   In fact, you get everything you get in the magazine, everything, every page of the current
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.320]   issue plus back issues.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:50.600]   And then there's bonus stuff, videos for instance, Consumer Reports is on here.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.800]   The London S Traveler, which I love, that's just like reading the, you know, thinking
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.680]   of dreaming of places I'm like, oh, we're going to get you a free trial so you can see
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.840]   what it would be like.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:05.680]   They have flat rate monthly pricing for a bunch of magazines.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.680]   And it's really great.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.400]   We just got, you know, we flew to Vegas for the National Association of Brokaster Show.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.160]   Many of our team are still down there.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:17.960]   We came back, but I was, I loved having all those magazines on my iPad.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.560]   Not really nice on the iPad Pro, I got to say.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.000]   It really looked good.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.760]   So get the texture app, sign up for the free trial.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.000]   It makes it, they make it easy.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.440]   You don't have to actually have a magazine in mind because their editors pick particular
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:35.480]   topics, interviews and stories that they, you know, they can tell are something you'd
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.800]   be interested in from what you've read in the past.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.400]   You could star your favorite magazines, which adds them to your personal library, downloads
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.000]   them so you don't have to worry about getting on the plane with no connectivity.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.080]   You'll have everything you want.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:49.800]   I used to bring a stack of magazines on the plane and leave them there.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.280]   Don't have to do that anymore.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.720]   They also don't have the coffee table clutter, men's health, wired, interview magazine,
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.920]   National Geographic, you know, just, just really fun to go through the pictures, the
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.120]   beautiful photography in National Geographic.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.280]   They've got many other photo magazines as well.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.680]   I just kind of enjoy them relax.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   I love it.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:17.520]   Texture, texture.com/macbreak for a free trial and bonus content as well from videos and
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   so forth.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   Texture.com/macbreak.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:28.200]   It's the app your iPad was made to do, made to run.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.120]   Thunderbolt 3 is 40 gigabits per second.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.400]   So maybe it is Thunderbolt 3 on the page.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   Some of those times.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.400]   I thought it was too, but I'm, you know, the chat, I'm going with the chat room because
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.000]   these guys, they don't have a terrible, I have a terrible memory for that sort of stuff.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Me too.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.360]   Spies and fees are now so hard to keep track of.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   Let me just look.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   It's fast.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.360]   It's fast.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.200]   There's now fast, faster and fastest.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.440]   The USB-C that does it all.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.200]   Thunderbolt 3, this is from Intel.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.080]   This was last year, June 2nd.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.640]   Yeah, 40 gigabits per second is Thunderbolt 3.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.200]   So that is a Thunderbolt 3 port on the back of the HP.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.240]   Nice.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   They make beautiful stuff.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.960]   I've had HP here in the office for a month at a time for a couple of years now.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.400]   And over the past year, I've been super impressed with their, with the hardware built.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.200]   It really is as nice and as satisfying as most power books.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.760]   Well, it's God.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   Dang it.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   How many years has happened to the MacBook?
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   And not power books.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   Power books.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   Well, tell you what, Andy, I will get one.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.760]   Oh man.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   Did you order one?
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   You said you ordered one, Renee.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760]   No.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.760]   MacBook, absolutely.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   MacBook.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   All right.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   So this is good.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   I know it's back very quickly, but I will order the HP.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.760]   You order the MacBook.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.560]   Actually, I already ordered the MacBook for Lisa.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.880]   But I'll order the HP.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.880]   I have a budget.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.440]   I can't really go crazy.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440]   I'm sure it's sure.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.480]   And with arm with just your respective notebook and just like naked and afraid.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.960]   You see, who's thin edges sharper and more devastating?
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.120]   I can trap a wild boa with my HP.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   Apple hired.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   Okay.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   This is great.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.760]   I love the battle between Tesla and Apple back and forth.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.880]   Remember that Elon Musk at Tesla said, oh yeah, we don't care about the people who
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   leave for Apple.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.720]   That's our rejects.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   That's our trash pile.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   Man, former Tesla VP of vehicle engineering.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.640]   I don't think he's a reject.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.440]   Apple just hired him for their special project car.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.960]   Yes, of course.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   His name.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.400]   Let me see is here.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.680]   He is also, I think, worked at where do you work, electric?
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.120]   No, that's the website.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   That's the website.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   Okay.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   Oh, electric.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   Discover this.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Aston.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.280]   He was at Aston Martin.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.680]   He was their chief engineer, Chris Porret.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.360]   So that's a pretty good hire.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.200]   And that's now the Tim Cook said, look, we can be speculative.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.120]   We have enough money to spend 1,000 employees doesn't make it a product, doesn't make it
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   reality.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.880]   That's something we're examining.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.840]   Yeah, but 1,000 employees and one of them is Chris Porret.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.680]   That kind of makes it more serious, doesn't it?
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.920]   I keep saying that it's the high level people that they're getting.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.280]   They're not telling the public what their plans are, but they're certainly telling these
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.240]   senior executives what they're planning.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.280]   And it's enough to get people to leave a really, really comfortable modern cruise ship with
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:35.000]   all the amenities and 18 restaurants and join this inflatable raft that has been unproven
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   as to this point.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.480]   You can't, in somebody like me where it's not going to go there, if it's just, well, we
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   may or may not do it, I would think unless they say to him, look, it's up to you.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.280]   If you can make this work, we'll do it.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.440]   There are a lot of people who at high levels, particularly engineering at companies, that
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:59.400]   they get bored after five or six years, even if tremendous success at a certain company,
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.280]   where the best pitch ever is we're going to let you work on something really, really new
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.680]   and really, really important.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.280]   And the compensation, of course, is going to be aggressive, but the best pitch they can
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.480]   make to a lot of these people is simply that, do you want to keep selling sugar water to
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.000]   kids or do you want to come change the world?
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.280]   And for that reason, even a project that they might be working for five years on this and
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.080]   nothing ever comes of it and they're never allowed to even talk about where they spent
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.280]   the last five years of their life, that's going to be worth it for them.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.480]   Yeah, it's super interesting too, because even inside and outside Apple, the iPhone was
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.280]   the hot thing and making the, some people really want to make the first iPhone.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.280]   Some people are happy making the sixth one, but there are people who making the sixth
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.880]   or seventh iPhone has almost no appeal.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.040]   And if you keep your sort of eye on the pulse of the Mac community, there's a lot of people
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.000]   going to Apple all of a sudden and they're doing it because there's something super interesting
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   to work on.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.920]   There's a lot of people who might otherwise leave Apple maybe, like Apple used to have
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.080]   a big retention problem and we don't hear about that as much these days.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.480]   So there might be super interesting things going on that are keeping these sorts of people,
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   the people who want to make the first and the new really, really interested.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.400]   Yeah, target aerospace.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.040]   Aerospace had the same thing with Elon Musk.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.320]   I mean, they're, they're, they got, Elon Musk hired a lot of very, very people, very talented
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.800]   people from established military and even commercial aerospace divisions.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.920]   And the reason why he got them is they're saying, look, we're going to build an entire,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.440]   we're starting from zero.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.560]   You are not going to be battling 25 years worth of infrastructure.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:33.440]   Your boss is not going to be someone who's who's, who's a vision of space flight was
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:37.240]   not established by his first, first space shuttle contract.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.080]   We're building something brand new.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.440]   That's how you get people losing.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.840]   We're going to build, we're going to take the vision of the space shuttle that's been
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.960]   frustrating you when you're working on that project for 15, 20 years and we're actually
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.320]   going to make it happen and they'll take a pay cut.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.280]   They'll move someplace they don't want to move to.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.720]   They will even work for a guy who might seem a little bit nuts and who might never actually
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.120]   ship anything because at some point you have enough money, your 401k is fully funded.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.200]   You know that the worst thing that can happen is that you will have four or five years of
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   savings to draw on while you figure out how to make money for the remaining 13 years before
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.520]   you can retire.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.840]   And that causes a lot of people to leave places of comfort and security for adventure.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.440]   And you can't buy adventure.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.480]   You can only give people opportunities for it.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.200]   A lot of credit, by the way, to electric, which is the sister site to nine and five
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.440]   back because they did some great research on this.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440]   There was no press release.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.560]   This is not exactly a public announcement.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:35.960]   Porret did the DB nine, which many consider Aston Martin's finest vehicle, the 177 supercar
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.760]   of the V12 Zagato.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.360]   He also apparently worked on the Model S and X and did a little on the Model 3 chassis.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:50.400]   So now left, he left according to electric Tesla in September 2015.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:57.000]   It doesn't mean he was fired, knocked around for three months, and then got a job at Apple.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.160]   Much more likely, Apple hired him, but due to requirements, contractual requirements,
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.960]   he couldn't join Apple for a few months.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.800]   I think that's pretty typical.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.960]   Like you have to wait six months before you can go to another competitor, something like
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   that.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   So compete is pretty standard.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.960]   They're not enforceable in the US, but in California.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.600]   It's the right to work state, yeah.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.640]   California says, no, you can't do that.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   However, I think a lot of people honor it.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.880]   Well, also, if you leave and you go too fast at the place else, you lose some of your options
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   and you don't have time to invest.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   Right.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   Yeah, maybe that was it.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   Yeah, who knows?
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.720]   But it's exactly six months, so that kind of is telling, isn't it?
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   You know what?
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.720]   I think it's exciting.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.040]   You want to see more people making electric cars?
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.600]   Apple would certainly have a stamp to put on it.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.320]   And I think that's important to understand that doing an electric car is, it's a very
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:55.760]   different kind of project than doing a car based on a gasoline or petrol because it's,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.920]   well, it's a different kind of engineering project.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.160]   And it's really a software project in many ways.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.840]   So Apple's expertise is not as foreign as one might think, especially if you can bring
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840]   in people like Port.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.240]   It's a computer with wheels for Apple.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   And they've made a computer that goes in your pocket, a computer that goes on in your lap,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.400]   a computer that goes on your wrist, the other making one with wheels that drives you around.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.120]   And many of the problems Apple has already solved are similar problems that Tesla has
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.520]   to solve problems like batteries and how to make it.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.160]   Tesla has an advantage there with the Gigafactory.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.600]   They're putting a massive battery factory online.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.920]   But that's really what you're buying a computer and a lot of batteries in the cost of these
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.240]   cars is like $35,000 worth of batteries.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   And then I think that Apple also has some expertise in supply chain, in manufacture that
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.600]   can be brought to bear.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.920]   Tesla's kind of hurting in that area, they're having a hard time getting these cars cracked
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920]   down.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.680]   Of course, they own a car factory, which Apple does not.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.840]   And we always remember that one of Apple's secret brilliance isn't just industrial design
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:02.280]   or putting a fast chip on a small device, but just simply managing that workflow, making
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.800]   sure that money goes into one end and functioning devices come out the other end without overruns
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.120]   or over stocks.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:17.560]   And also realize that Apple can have it if they decide to actually create a car, they
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.520]   can have a success on the level of Tesla success by just selling a couple of dozen tens of
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.680]   thousands of cars a year.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.320]   If they're not, they don't have to create the Toyota Corolla.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.520]   They don't have to have 100 million of these cars built over over 10 years.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.080]   They can have a very, very big, very, very public and satisfying success if they only
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.880]   sell 20,000 of these.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.600]   So long as it's an iPhone like success where not just it's not simply not numeric, but
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.920]   simply everyone agrees that this is something that didn't really exist before or didn't
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.040]   exist in this form.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:10:00.240]   And at least Tesla or Musk at least pays lip service to the idea that, oh, we want a lot
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.720]   of other companies to make these.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.720]   I think he's more competitive than that.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.360]   But he's been fairly clear that they're not going to, for instance, encumber the patents
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.920]   that they create.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.760]   They're willing to share those as long as the company they share them with shares is
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.760]   like a futurist.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760]   I mean, he wants to get people on large.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   And you need help to change the world.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   So I think there's part of them that's competitive because anyone in that position is competitive.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.960]   But also there is part of them who feels like he's moving the world forward alone and he's
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   love a little bit of help.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   Absolutely.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.600]   And also really said a lot of that is going to require legislation.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.680]   If he really wants to move forward on self-driving cars without having to simply tell people
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.280]   "Okay, wink, wink, make sure you have both of your hands on the wheel, wink, wink."
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.640]   And make sure you touch the wheel, wink, wink, once every few seconds, wink, or else
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.280]   this doesn't work.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.360]   Things like infrastructure for cars that are not based on petrol, but definitely are
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.200]   definitely going to require charging up from time to time.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.080]   Expertise and installing home refueling stations.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.400]   This is the sort of thing where you can do it all by yourself if you're Andrew Carnegie
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.200]   and it's the 1800s and there are no rules.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.120]   You can basically create whatever you want and steal and bend whatever laws you want.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.840]   In the modern age, very few people can grease that many palms to actually inflict a change
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.720]   upon society and an infrastructure.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.200]   The only thing I keep saying though is that I really wish that we don't know what Apple
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.720]   is aiming for, but I wish they were aiming for a bigger idea than just an electric car.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.280]   But we'll see what they're actually trying to build.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.800]   I think if their time frame is 2020, that's not going to be an autonomous vehicle.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.000]   But I think everybody's degrees of autonomy.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Exactly.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.960]   I mean, by 2020, I expect my model X to be driving me around.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.880]   A lot of these companies are shifting towards not something that they can actually get laws
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.720]   passed for, but also something that they can sell to consumers.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.160]   Consumers are really resistant.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.920]   Whether you're driving a car or you have to share a road with a self-driving car, they're
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.880]   very resistant to the idea of car pulls up into your driver, you jump in, it takes it
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.840]   over and over and over and over and over.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.360]   We're talking about simply like a merging from local traffic, local roads onto highways.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.720]   And then once you're on the highway, the car is going to take over all the highway duties
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.880]   and keep you safe.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.320]   All that stuff where it's just keeping the center lane or the right-hand lane for the
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.120]   next 45 minutes.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.160]   And then basically the car says, "Okay, now in five minutes, there's going to be an exit.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.840]   I will get you off this road, but at that point you're going to have to take over for
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.760]   the local roads."
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.080]   Because they feel as though they can get that working because they can also very effectively
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.240]   make the case that this will make highways safer, this will bring the speed.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.880]   Once we have, let's say, 12% of the cars that are autonomous and absolutely will not
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.760]   drive above the speed limit, that will force everybody to drive at the speed limit.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.800]   Because unless you want to be by Michael Knight and be zigzagging all around these cars,
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.880]   they're going 65 miles an hour, it really is going to pay off for just about everybody.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.800]   And it's also as a technical thing.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.720]   There are no bicycles on the highway.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.160]   There are no people trying to cross the highway.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.000]   They're occasionally people who are trying to transport a mattress on the highway by strapping
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.360]   each other roof of their sedan, and it falls off.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.720]   But these are things that it can do very well with.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:17.240]   And every time that they post a video of a Tesla in autonomous mode, automatically shifting
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.840]   out of the lane to avoid a truck that didn't see it in their rear-room mirror and the delay
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.600]   change, that makes it one-treatier for them to make that sale.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.800]   WWDC, it's official.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.560]   Siri announced it.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.040]   This is really getting weird.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.120]   Siri is starting to announce Apple events.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.000]   Trust the robotic voice.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.640]   But Apple has confirmed when you ask Siri, and this started a few days ago, when is Dub--
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   well, I could try it.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.920]   Let's just see what she says.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   When is WWDC?
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:52.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   Well, oh, did I cut her off?
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.560]   It says, will be held June 13 through June 17 through 17 through San Francisco.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.560]   I can't wait.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.560]   I don't know why she stopped talking.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560]   I must have pushed a button.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560]   Let me ask her.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.400]   I think it went Google I/O is.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.400]   When is Google I/O?
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400]   Here is some web results.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.400]   Searching Google for I/O.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.280]   She's just pretending she doesn't understand.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.000]   That's all.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.040]   Whatever you do mean, Leo.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.680]   When is WWDC?
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.240]   The World Wide Developers Conference, www.wc. will be held June 13 through June 17 in San
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   Francisco.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240]   I'm so excited.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.440]   Oh, wow.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.640]   That was not robotic.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.200]   That was like-- they brought the lady in the recording.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.360]   I'm so excited.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.160]   She's doing a live reading every time.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160]   Really?
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:44.960]   Does this give Apple latitude to, like a spokesperson later said that Siri was-- it was not quality
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.960]   golf.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.280]   It was not authorized to make this announcement and has no knowledge of the event.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.200]   And they can basically then put it whatever day they want.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.600]   Siri did a party last night.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600]   And she was drawn.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   Oh, we're sorry.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.600]   She was drawn.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.400]   Describing Siri as a disgruntled fire worker.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400]   But I think Apple has now confirmed it, right?
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.880]   June 13 through 17.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:10.080]   In fact, they've also said something interesting that the keynote will not be in Moscone West
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.960]   although the rest of the event is in Moscone West.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.720]   It's going to be in the much larger Bill Graham Auditorium where they had their last thing,
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   right?
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.320]   Yeah, and the last thing was there primarily because they had those giant living rooms
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   for the new Apple TV.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.200]   So there weren't a ton of people there, but they needed a ton of space to show off things.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.200]   The W.C.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.960]   keynote is not usually a big hardware event.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.480]   So they might just want the space to get all the developers and all the media and everybody
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   else in.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480]   OK.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480]   We're excited.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.600]   It's the spaces deeply constrained for people who want to attend as developers, but for media
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.440]   that goes wide open for that keynote.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.600]   Lottery system for tickets for developers?
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.920]   I imagine so, right?
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.920]   Very hard.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.960]   You know, these things sell in seconds, so it's not fair.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.960]   I guess I'm sure you guys will be going.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   I hope not.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   I don't know.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   I'll think about it.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   I'm booked.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   So I'm going to go regardless.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.000]   Because I've got for many years I didn't get invited and I go either way and I just hang
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.840]   out because there's so many cool people there.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.960]   So you don't know yet if you'd be invited?
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   No.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.120]   I'm just looking at the days that's Monday through Friday.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.240]   It's a full week in June.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.560]   And last year Friday was in full day.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   It wasn't like previous years where it was sort of a half a day and then a beer bash.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.000]   It was a full day last year.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   OK.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.480]   Well, there's a lot to talk about.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.600]   So we'll do our usual coverage of the keynote.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.640]   I guess that'll be Monday morning, June 13th.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   From 10 to 12.30.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.120]   It's already on the calendar.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.120]   Jason Klayeth has jumped on that.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.480]   So if you're not in the keynote, Andy, please join me and we'll stream that live.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.480]   I do think this will be a huge deal.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.280]   I do think this is going to be unusually interesting.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.800]   There are a lot of architecture shoes that have not dropped yet.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.600]   That F Apple one that basically Apple is now able to really talk about.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.480]   So I was mentally preparing a list a few days ago about what could Apple talk about at WWDC.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   I mean, that's what I started thinking about almost every April or May.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.920]   And it's like, oh, we could think and talk about this.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.760]   And oh, they could talk about a swing towards that.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.080]   One of the things on the list was was ARM based max.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.720]   Again, not based on--
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.760]   ARM is not based on any knowledge that I might have.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.040]   But it's like, there are a lot of-- last year, we could figure out that, well, they
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.600]   got to do this and they got to talk about that.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.520]   And they're definitely going to be releasing this.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.680]   This year, there's a lot that could be on the table.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.960]   This could be a really, really great keynote.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.040]   developer.apple.com/WWDC gives you a command line.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.000]   I think if this were Google, they would actually have it type out.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.720]   And it would be active and you could type in other commands.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.720]   Come on, Apple soft.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720]   It would be a REPL.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.680]   It would be a REPL in here and you could actually ask it questions.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.040]   Who committed that to get?
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   Come on.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.720]   We're not going to be talking about self-driving cars.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.720]   So maybe they figured out if that was a custom talk.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.920]   Some people were saying that was a mono space version of San Francisco, but I didn't see
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.920]   any follow-up on it.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920]   It's a nice font.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.400]   I like the font.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.880]   It would be a very nice font in my terminal.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.360]   It's one of the agency colors.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.360]   People use terminal.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.640]   Spend a lot of energy talking about mono space fonts and which one to use and is in
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.120]   Consulata better than Droid Sans or perhaps you would prefer.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.960]   I use source code pro sans.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.760]   Although lately anonymous pro is really looking good.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   It's so silly.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   It's like whiskey's.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   It's like you.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.760]   It is.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.720]   For most people, there's kind of this.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.360]   You get your first impression and you either like it or you don't like it.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:39.240]   For other people, they will say, "Well, the thing is, of course, it's more of an earthy
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.840]   sort of peaty sort of syrif."
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.240]   I wonder if I view source if I can see what the-
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.600]   Para-Melly a little bit.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.640]   It says myriad set pro V2.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.280]   Marriott is an Adobe font, surely.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.240]   I think they left that descender in the barrels a little bit too long.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.080]   Wow, they're using myriad.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.680]   I also had to go along with this.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.840]   They announced a whole bunch of new resources for developers.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.000]   They have a bunch of case studies called developer insight.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.520]   They have a bunch of best practices for how to get featured on the app store.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.600]   A bunch of companies, you know, barge companies like Evernote and smaller companies have written
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.880]   up sort of how they've done regionalization and how they've done premium models.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.440]   There's videos as well.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.320]   There's a ton of new developer information to go along with all this, which is really
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.320]   cool.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.960]   This is by the way, beautiful code Apple.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:32.760]   It's clearly hand-coded and BB-headed.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   Very lovely.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.800]   And they will be streaming live.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.800]   And they will be.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.800]   You know already.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   Nice.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.440]   There you go.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:46.480]   I think it's about time for Apple to have an unofficial or unofficial surprise party for
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.240]   the people behind BB-headed.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:53.520]   They'll get them, make sure they get their tickets to WWDC.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.360]   And either as a meeting or as a start off for some sort of panel that only they know
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.120]   is not about not an actual tech talk.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:07.400]   It'll just be a big cake for everybody to show their love for BB-headed.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   Ex-code is-
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.880]   The X-Cake for Rich Seagull.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:13.680]   One reason they might be using the Bill Graham is because it is a concert venue.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.480]   And on Thursday, the bash will be there.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:21.240]   And they're really promoting that it will have, you know, it says here phenomenal music
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.600]   at this outstanding concert venue.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   So-
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   About their music, Bojo back.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.600]   The traditional developer bash will be a concert, I guess.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600]   But it's not Tay-Tay.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.000]   It's not Tay-Tay-Leo in the picture.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   I don't know who that is.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   Taylor Swift.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Oh, Tay-Tay.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.040]   No, I don't think developers are really Taylor Swift fans.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.520]   She's still recovering from her spill off of that credit.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.520]   That's correct.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.520]   She could mic drop now.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.760]   She's back and full effect.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.320]   She has a new ad.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.320]   Really?
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320]   All right.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   Let's see it.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.320]   The new Tay-Tay ad.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320]   They're really-
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:59.520]   That's interesting how they're sticking with this command line stuff.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:07.880]   Jason Snell did his presentation at Yosemite as he fired up an Apple II emulator and did
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.360]   it all in like as an Apple Soft Basic app.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.680]   And I got so jealous and I made plans to do one of my presentations that way and not
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.040]   give him the slightest bit of credit.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.360]   She by the way, here's the new ad.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.800]   Just she's an emo queen according to some.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.800]   Please.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:26.800]   Getting.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.400]   Please start over so we can hear all the dialogue because I want to- I don't want to miss a word
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   of Taylor's.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   Just a second.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   Okay.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   Activities.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.080]   Getting ready to go out.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.280]   Oh my God.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   I love this song.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   Shung her ass.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.320]   This is a middle school.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.240]   Two years ago.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.240]   Hey.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.640]   Don't write yourself off yet.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.880]   She's singing your head to be left hanging into her hairbrush.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.400]   I admire her for doing this.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.800]   Obviously the Apple and Taylor have made up.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   She's listening.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   Also that she's singing goofy.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800]   I mean she's dancing goofy.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.800]   She's always been that way.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   She's exactly.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.960]   I love that her brand is I'm just- I'm a normal person.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   I'm not a trainer.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.960]   I'm a singer.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   I'm a composer.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.960]   I'm not a dancer.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   So I will just simply flail around.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   Right.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.840]   Expressing my joy and reaction to the music.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.840]   Doesn't mind being silly.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.280]   And this band is very, very happy right now.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.280]   Right.
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:35.880]   Because Jimmy E. World had really the sales had really been going down over the last couple
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   of years.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.600]   Now that they tape on.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.240]   I'm not kidding.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.960]   Of course that's going to be a viral hit again.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960]   Right.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   Don't you think?
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.120]   I mean that carries a lot of weight.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.000]   Jimmy E. World the middle if you want to go order it.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.280]   Actually wait a minute.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.920]   In just two hours.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.480]   Two million views on Facebook.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   28,000 likes on Twitter.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.840]   725,000 likes on Instagram.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.520]   And I can guarantee you Jimmy E. World is back on the charts baby.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.720]   Oh man.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.520]   Oh man.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.480]   Oh man.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.480]   That is she has 74 million followers.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.600]   Jimmy doesn't have to take that job in marketing after all.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:24.520]   Jimmy the world is yours to eat once again.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.400]   Don't if you're a Windows user please uninstall QuickTime now.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:33.280]   And unfortunately I know many people use for instance Adobe Premiere which requires
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.760]   QuickTime for encoding in certain formats.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.200]   But Apple has announced now it's official.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.480]   Was the Wall Street Journal that broke it but Apple has confirmed it isn't going to support
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.520]   or update QuickTime 7 for Windows any longer and there are known exploits.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:56.600]   Oh probably have as much luck with that news release as Microsoft had for the five years
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.200]   have told people to please stop using Windows XP.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.240]   Well a lot of people can't stop using it.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.200]   We first heard this not from Apple but from the computer emergency response team at the
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.040]   Department of Homeland Security.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:14.040]   They said by the way stop using QuickTime on Windows is dangerous.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.280]   And the Apple had confirmed it.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.840]   So the engineer has been reassigned.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:26.960]   So here's Apple's excellent page and had on install QuickTime.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.560]   If you no longer need it the problem is some programs do need it.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.000]   QuickTime 7 which hasn't existed on the Mac for years.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.360]   Right it is legacy.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.920]   I mean you know you do have to kill it eventually.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.040]   It's just sad that it has security flaws known security flaws.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:48.360]   The problem is that any plugin that gets launched when you're browsing is really there's a higher
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360]   standard for it.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.520]   You know Adobe reader or Flash.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.240]   There's a higher standard for it because many browsers are configured just when you get
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.240]   to some QuickTime content.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.800]   Oh just launch QuickTime.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:04.360]   And that means a bad guy can embed dangerous content in an ad on a legitimate site or whatever
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.840]   and it will just get activated without your involvement.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.560]   And so that's really important.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.960]   I think there's a higher standard for browser plugins.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.320]   And I think Apple needs to do a little bit more to I don't know how they solve this.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:24.800]   I understand why you don't want to support QuickTime 7 anymore.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:29.360]   Will Mac OS 10 be renamed Mac OS?
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.760]   Sounds like so.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.480]   So they put this in the in source code.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.320]   Oh no it was on a web page.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.840]   I think it was a couple of it.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.400]   They got they did it twice by accident.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.400]   Wink Wink.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.400]   I don't know.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.480]   But this is the kind of thing you'll announce at WWDC.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.040]   It kind of makes sense.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.760]   Yeah whatever they used to make a big point about how Mac OS 10 was the excuse me.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:55.040]   We have this we have this wonderful OS called OS 10 and we have a version of it running
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040]   on the iPhone.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:00.840]   We have a version of it running on the Mac and it's a very flexible sort of thing.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.320]   And now there's really no need to make hay from that anymore.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:11.640]   But also they seem to be on a nomenclature trend trying to remove any numbers trying
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.680]   to scrape off the dates and the file numbers like it's stolen stereo or something like
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.680]   that.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.880]   So that it can just be Mac OS.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.320]   It's not Mac OS 10.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.520]   No one's going to ask about Mac OS 11 or Mac OS 12.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.680]   It is simply Mac OS.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.920]   I wonder though because they still have like I it'll be iOS 10 this year TV OS 10 watch
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.920]   OS 3.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.240]   Will they say Mac OS 10?
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.960]   Will they say Mac OS 11 because that comes after 10.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.480]   It's actually 10.12 coming out with a say Mac OS.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.480]   They call it Mac OS.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   They call it watch OS.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   They call it TV OS.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480]   But then you get the problem with the computers.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.440]   It's like they just call it MacBook but really it's MacBook late 2012 and it's MacBook
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.440]   early 2013.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.720]   Well then remember the trouble they got in when they remember how surprising it was when
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.920]   they announced that the next iPad is going to be called the new iPad and it really does
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.920]   kind of.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.320]   Yeah, well it also takes some of the some of the curse off of well I haven't I've won.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.560]   What's the what's the latest iPad the iPad 3?
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.840]   Oh wow the iPad 3 is but I don't for a year or two.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.800]   Why is there an iPad 4?
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.480]   Where as if you just simply have the iPad if you just simply call this new MacBook this
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.760]   is the late 2015 MacBook.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:22.080]   It doesn't put them on on notice to make sure that they're always releasing on an artificial
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   schedule.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:29.480]   I would love to see them freed from the constraint of having to produce a new phone every fall
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   every single year.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.000]   Then you see MacBook late 2013 and you wonder what's going to be Mac Pro late 2013 and
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.600]   just wonder what's going on.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.360]   Well we need to remember we needed that because there's a time when we could actually buy hard
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.560]   drives and RAM and we need to know what we had.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.080]   Now it's like you see they dip it in concrete when they when they sell it to you so okay.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.920]   So I'm still looking for my mom had the new iPad and she was looking for like cases for
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]   it.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.000]   He would type in cases new iPad and it would just it was not useful results that were coming
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   back to her.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.040]   When you typed in like iPad two cases that was fine.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040]   That's a really good point.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:07.000]   I mean iPad is iPad is iPad doesn't work for search doesn't know.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.360]   Or something it means that we no longer have to argue about whether it's Mac OS X or Mac
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.160]   OS X and other gift versus Jeff argument.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:18.440]   They'll keep the code names.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.520]   El Capitan that's enough to distinguish it I think.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.440]   What they mean that's interesting because they don't use originally their cat names were
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.160]   code names and the marketing department liked them so much they turned them into public
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.280]   names and then they went and they had to make new code names so they used wine names
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.280]   for a while.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.680]   Now they use Apple names on on iOS they use the names of ski resorts on the watch they
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.000]   use a name of beaches and they don't make those public as would they go to having you
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.480]   know landmark names for this where they drop those entirely and just you know half Mac
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.080]   OS it's kind of interesting I find this so fascinating because you make this change you
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.920]   can use it as an excuse to redo everything.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:02.000]   Playmate has reviewed the screen and the new iPad pro 9.7 inch again the iPad that has
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:09.560]   no pro that has no name the baby iPad Pro Junior and it has said is its color accuracy
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.680]   is truly impressive.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:18.440]   It also interestingly supports to not one but two color gamuts including a new one DCI
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.520]   P3 which is used by the new UHD 4K TVs.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.720]   It had to have that incredibly high standard in order for true tone to function because
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.240]   if they couldn't tell what the color calibration was they couldn't adjust it properly.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:37.880]   That's really impressive this peak brightness is 20% brighter than the iPad Air 2.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.600]   A very impressive screen.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.200]   True tone they talk a little they review a little bit about true tone.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:51.600]   They say most users might not want such drastic color change with ambient light anyway.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:57.680]   Doesn't come close to matching the color of reflected light from white paper however
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.720]   they recommend that true tone should have a slider that would allow you to change the
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.640]   magnitude.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.680]   Night shift they talk a little bit about night shift.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.800]   On true tone I want partially true tone I want light tone.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:14.960]   I know you know that's fine you can turn off true tone if it bugs you and similarly with
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.040]   night shift.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:24.680]   Vuing angle performance because it's an IPS LCD display they say we didn't expect much
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.800]   change with viewing angle and no color shifts and in fact the lab did measure excellent
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.920]   viewing angle performance with no visibly noticeable color shifts.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.480]   So it sounds like a very nice display they call it an excellent top tier display on the
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.320]   iPad Pro 9.7 outstanding impressive.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.120]   It really is really impressive.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:52.240]   I've had both in the office for a couple of weeks and they I bet 13 inches no slouch whatsoever
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.480]   but when you put it side by side you know which one you'd kind of rather be working
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.480]   with.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.480]   I got my favorite.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:02.320]   I started off this show by complaining about how Apple doesn't seem to really invest in
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:06.480]   great keyboards but all of that attention that they might have put into creating either
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.520]   a great keyboard or even halfway decent mouse they put into well your user I everybody uses
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.240]   their eyeballs or most of our users use their eyeballs.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.920]   Let's make the most obscenely great displays we can even if people are not going to appreciate
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.760]   them right out of the box.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.840]   Speak really wanted the next iPhone so badly.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:26.880]   Well right and speaking of displays it looks like Apple has reached an agreement with Samsung
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.160]   to supply OLED panels starting not this year but next year so that would be in the iPhone
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.920]   8 not the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 7s.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:40.800]   That's super interesting because OLED screens if people haven't used them and which is likely
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.960]   if you've been using iPhones all this time they have a real great pop to them that aren't
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:52.080]   necessarily natural colors but they're really beautiful colors and I'm wondering if part
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:57.000]   of the reason why they have this new technology in the 9.7 and Schidepad Pro is that's going
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   to be reflected in a new display driver so that you can drive an OLED screen and not
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.840]   make it look like quite so flag of a flag designed by a seven year old kid during art
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:12.920]   class colorific while still being intense.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:17.360]   You get incredible white you get incredible blacks and anything in between it's just you
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.640]   need a little bit of finesse to make it look totally natural.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.360]   The Apple Watch is LG OLED so people who are from Apple Watch are at least basically familiar
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   with it.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.880]   Yeah I'm a big fan and it's true once you see the OLED black you never go back it really
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   is rich.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.040]   It's just one of the reasons it has to be refactored because that's still LED dependent
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.200]   but I'm sure Apple's got that covered already.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.440]   I have to explain to people when they want to see the photos I've taken on the I'll have
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:46.080]   like a Samsung S7 like in my pocket and they're oh my god those are the best pictures ever
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:50.800]   when Apple photos as good as this thing they are you're just seeing this super intense
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.800]   screen.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:56.720]   Let me put this on my iPad and you'll see that it's excellent but not that not that
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.720]   better.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:02.700]   Yeah no I I've kind of hooked on it and that yeah it's hard to let it go so I lost the
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   blocks.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   Yeah hit the sat.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:08.480]   Yeah I mean look also realize a lot of people share their photos by simply holding up their
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.640]   phones to other people so that could be a real serious win.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:12.640]   Right right.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.920]   Let's see what right to have that as your background.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.000]   Isn't that awesome.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.380]   That's Bill Atkinson and his license plates and by if by now I'm sure you've all listened
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.600]   to our triangulation with Bill.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.800]   He's coming back by the way we're going to do a super tutorial on his his app photo
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.540]   card but he brought which was so sweet of him.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.660]   He brought a lot of show and tell including his license plates over the years so when
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:42.360]   he was working on the original Macintosh it said fat bits which of course is his you
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.720]   know if you ever used Mac Payne which Bill wrote you remember the magnifying glass the
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.160]   fat bits magnifying glass then graph man because of course he was the graphics guy at
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.520]   Apple he did the quick draw primitives at Apple then hypercard that must that's a great
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.160]   I mean talk about a great license plate and finally G.N. magic which is his general magic
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:02.160]   license plate.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.600]   General magic so that was Gasha was really he was history right that picture he is such

[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.420]   some video to explain how to use this app it's not getting out to the world and I want
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:23.100]   more people to use he said I miss having the Apple marketing engine you know I'm not a
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:27.960]   marketer I'm a programmer I'm an engineer and I said well we're not marketers either
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.140]   terrible at it but at least I can help you make a video that will show people how to
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:37.480]   do it so we're gonna do that on the 25th he's gonna come by it would be it's a Monday would
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:42.060]   be our normal triangulation slacks that's next Monday isn't it and he'll be coming by
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:47.400]   and we'll be airing a different triangulation we've already recorded but are we I guess
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.120]   we'll stream it live where no we're airing a part two of all of the air part two of our
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.800]   interview with Bill Atkinson and meanwhile behind the scenes Bill and I'll be doing a
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:01.480]   photo card tutorial which we will air then as a special I guess and we're gonna do it
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.900]   without commercial so he can use it on his site to help people understand how I want
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:11.180]   to promote photo card it's really cool I love it I know I'm so I'm so sorry that I
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:15.260]   didn't get into until I listened to that triangulation I set myself like four different
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:19.900]   postcards and not only did I really enjoy the pictures I enjoyed getting photo postcards
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:27.580]   from somebody even if that person was myself and so now I'm gonna send you one I'm sending
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:32.440]   you photo cards I'm gonna be in DC like later this week I'm already thinking here with people
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.220]   that I want to send photo cards from like DC when I'm gonna get places Instagram is great
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:41.620]   Facebook is great but there's something about getting something he talked about on the show
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:44.740]   it's like something that you're holding in your hand you can put it on the fridge and
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:48.500]   it's like and it's they're beautiful photos and they're big and they're laminated and
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:54.300]   the news is as coasters and your beer on your friend's face and it'll be great well I started
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:36:00.260]   sending photo cards to family and members and my mom I sent her I had a picture of my kids
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:04.380]   her grandchildren so I made a photo card it's a beautiful picture and so she can put that
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:08.060]   on her mantelpiece and then you know you can put little stickers of your net you can show
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:13.100]   that I don't think it matters so great you can put I'll take a hide her address you can
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.700]   put stickers you know signature I put my signature in there and I don't know why I said her it's
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:24.540]   she's greater but it kind of lends itself to kind of whimsy and fun and so spontaneous
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:29.780]   yeah there's this and it's fun and it's a buck it's a buck 50 including 50 cents postage
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.980]   49 cents postage to send it so it's not very expensive and it's like it's like buying a
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:38.820]   you buy a block of like 30 dollars worth of credits and it's like having like stamps in
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.980]   your wallet where it's like well I got a stamp I may as well use them and it's like I said
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.820]   I'm that happens give me so much pleasure and hopefully it'll and it'll please and or annoy
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:53.140]   people that I'm sending cards to I've started using it because it's cheaper than setting
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:58.020]   out publicity photos you know printing and sending publicity for people want autograph
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:02.540]   now what I do is I don't print new photos I just get I could take some photos from great
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:06.140]   and so they can be up to date they're beautiful they're actually nicer much nicer than the
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:12.540]   ones we had printed and I can put an autograph on it and it's you know so you know I won't
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:17.620]   I'll I'll hide the address again on this but that's you know that's so if you ask me if
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:23.380]   you send me a note it sent me a nice note I'll send you or send me a gift even better
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:30.380]   my shirt size is 17 and a half 34 even even better even better just just like a ham radio
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:35.620]   operators will like send a card with a with a call sign anybody who sends you a photo card
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:39.780]   will get a photo card oh I like that this you know what this should be my QSL what am I
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:46.500]   thinking yeah oh there's another market hams make these cards all the time their QSO cards
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:54.140]   they send out and I should I've never printed one up Andy brilliant I now have a QSO card
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:38:02.780]   I love to serve really it's really really anyway I feel like I've been I have been very
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:09.660]   fortunate to get to know Steve Wozniak Andy Hertzfeld I knew cap and crunch and then
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:15.180]   now Bill Atkinson I've talked to some of the people who changed my life and I think changed
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:20.780]   our world dramatically and I really is a privilege so like especially especially I know we were
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:27.180]   about to turn to a pumpkin but I as a kid it's like I would I would idolize Steve Jobs
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.180]   and Steve Wozniak and a couple other engineers we was particularly I felt that the disc to
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:35.860]   control the card and driver card inside the hardware I could just I just kept staring at
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:41.700]   it how beautiful it was and the fact that I know I know was is like how did that happen
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:48.260]   I know that the ten year old boy is like the is like like I can't whatever you did to
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:52.980]   get us to the point where like you know this person I totally prove of all the life choices
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:58.660]   you made we had such a fun interview yesterday at NAB with Matthew Wood who is the supervising
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:04.260]   senator at Skywalker sound and he's like you and me you know he was a Star Wars fanatic
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:10.100]   as a kid and he got to work on restoring the sound he restored the sound for episodes four
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:15.860]   five and six when they had their theatrical re-release and he said handling those original
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:23.460]   tapes that had never been opened again after making episode four they'd never been opened again
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:29.940]   taking them out and and holding them you know there's the original Han Solo there's the original
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:35.700]   princess Leia voice he here same thing it was the guy who said I'm living a dream I can't
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.540]   believe I get to do this by the way he was great if you have not seen yesterday's triangulation
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:45.300]   and we're gonna do more with him he's even invited us I hesitate to mention this because I'm sure
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:52.180]   that somebody Lucas will say no to go to the ranch and shoot some some story about the ranch
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:56.580]   which now I don't think anybody's ever got into I love the story about how he got the job
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:01.540]   oh he was a 17 year old lives in Petaluma by the way he's a local guy I had to go to Vegas to interview
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:08.100]   he was living in Petaluma he'd seen that there was a job opening for a quality control guy in
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:14.980]   Nacasio which is this is like nowhere is ville farm about by the coast here and he thought he said
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:19.620]   you know that has to be Lucas because who else is out there so he applied he fact he's
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:23.860]   dad had a fax machine very rare I guess he said in the facts and they said no one's ever sent
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:30.260]   as a fax resume you're hired he was hired as a game tester for Lucas Games LucasArts Games
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:34.500]   and has never left 26 years later he's still at the ranch
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:40.100]   at who would be up at first that would be my policy yeah wouldn't be
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:44.820]   so yeah if you haven't heard that last triangulation with Matthew Wood please listen to that we're
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.140]   gonna wrap I know Renee you got to go and I want to get your picks before we do we have to mention
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:54.660]   that Bill Campbell passed away of cancer at the age of 75 long time apple board member they called
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:41:00.900]   him coach because it's very young days he was a coach football coach at Columbia but really he
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:07.380]   was a coach for all of Silicon Valley and a great many people in Silicon Valley report that they
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:16.500]   their careers were were inspired by were driven by certainly Steve Jobs by Bill Campbell who was
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:21.140]   by all accounts of the nicest guys in Silicon Valley and of course he occupies the front page
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:26.820]   today on apple.com I did not know Bill any either of you meet Bill Ever.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:31.220]   No I've just knew my name yeah quite so it was quite legendary.
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:37.780]   Some people some people their their genius gift is engineering some people like Bill's from
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:42.980]   everything I've read about him over the past five or ten years is his genius was in helping other
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:47.540]   people find a thing that's going to drive them for the rest of their lives and just let him fire
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:53.540]   under him that's that's such a rare gift that it's because it's such a blessing because your
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:42:01.220]   gift allows other people to succeed in their dreams it's not about creating it's not about I've
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.580]   invested in the right company so I'm going to be able to get a boat that docks in front of my
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:10.340]   smaller boat or whatever so that's it it was he was he was a blessing in so many lives yeah we
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:17.140]   owe a lot to him but I showed today brought to you by Wealthfront you got to you got to save money
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:22.420]   you got to you got to save it for your retirement for your family's financial health for college
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:29.700]   you got to save but doing it yourself is not a good idea I did that and I forgot to even pay
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:37.700]   attention to my my investments for some time traditional advisors if you hire one charge way
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.780]   too much from one to three percent and by the way of what they manage every year means you have to
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.860]   make three percent more just a break even and by the way do they necessarily gonna do a good job I
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.980]   know no you can get started with Wealthfront for as little as five hundred dollars that's the
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.900]   minimum investment but before you even do that I want you to go to Wealthfront.com and see what
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:00.020]   they've come up with here see they charge one quarter of one percent not one two three percent one
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:04.100]   quarter of one percent and they could do it because it's a computer and computers you don't have to
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:10.420]   really pay them anything but the computer has built in the brains of some of the best people in the
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:17.540]   world Nobel Prize winning academic research the best investment practices artificial intelligence
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.940]   it's getting better all the time and instead of just checking in on your account once a year as you
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:27.140]   might do or once a quarter as an advisor might do it it's watching it minute by minute day by day
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:32.500]   now it's not day trading this is long-term investing but there are reasons why you want to
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:37.060]   rebalance on a regular basis pay attention to losses so you could do tax loss harvesting
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:42.580]   things like that you you're gonna really be impressed with what they're doing here using
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:48.180]   the power of EFTs to really allow you to get into a variety of stocks in a variety of sectors in a
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:53.380]   diversified way ways it's just hard for you to do yourself no wonder two point six billion dollars
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:58.340]   in client assets now under management and it's growing all the time you got to check it out
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:03.220]   and again I don't want you to put a penny in until you read about it at wealthfront.com/macbreak
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:08.020]   but once you satisfy yourself that this is a good idea and you can look at their past performance
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:14.180]   I mean it's just you know this has been a tough time for the market uh watch see how they're doing
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:19.300]   I think you'll be impressed and for tweet listeners if you sign up to invest wealth front will manage

[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:30.980]   my pick of the week is an app that's the reason why I have about 500 bytes left on my internal SSD
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:36.820]   of my MacBook it's called downy and it is the best video downloader app I have ever come across
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:42.340]   from Mac downy I never heard it's it's because it's it's an app that you see that there's a
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:48.740]   I watch a lot of a lot of my entertainment on YouTube and I love that people will post like
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:54.180]   BBC documentaries from 15 or 20 years ago I was watching the behind beyond the fringe
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:58.900]   documentary that aired in like 1982 when someone has a VHS and they posted it and this is not
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:02.980]   something you can buy commercially and it's never going to be released commercially and this thing
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:08.260]   would have been forgotten and if weren't for somebody putting it on YouTube and so I will I feel no
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:12.420]   guilt about watching it on YouTube and actually downloading it so I will have in case it ever
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:18.980]   goes away again downy is you all you got to do is if you're in any almost any app that
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:24.580]   excuse me almost any web page that has embedded video and if you go into the preferences box for
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:30.740]   it you can see that it lists like a thousand different websites that have video all the way
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:40.660]   from the from like ESPN Facebook Fox News Fox Business get the guy global news got to
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:47.460]   Google Docs Google video this like on and on and on and on all you got to do is just paste the
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:53.780]   URL cut and paste the URL into this window or even just grab a block of text that has it and it
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:59.220]   will find the URL and we'll just simply start downloading the best quality of that video and it
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:04.660]   will even is even a browser plugin so you can just simply be on YouTube just click the downy button
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:10.260]   and it will just simply add that to the download queue and has all kind it understands why people
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:16.260]   download videos from YouTube it's sometimes sometimes I do it because I'm using it sort of as a DVR
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:21.140]   and I'm going to be putting it on my on my Android phone so I can watch this when I'm
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:24.180]   when I'm on the train or something like that but also sometimes it's
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:31.780]   oftentimes some some people will have like will record like an hour long radio interview with
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:38.580]   Diana Domra my favorite my favorite opera soprano and uploaded it as a YouTube video with like photos
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:43.780]   as just to fill in the video track I really just want the audio and I was already I was still
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:47.780]   testing out this app and I was thinking okay I'm gonna have to paste this into a quick time and then
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:53.780]   just like save it as an audio file no there is just right in the right in the downy menu under
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:58.580]   settings you can ask for post-processing and say please just extract the audio of this and save
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:05.860]   this as an mp3 file so if you're using streaming video sites as your DVR and also legitimately if
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:13.140]   you're concerned that someone has posted something derogatory or slanderous to you and for instance
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:16.900]   and I feel so they're gonna take it down as soon as they feel the heat you can actually and you
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:22.340]   want to basically save a copy of it before this gets taken down you can have a copy of that on
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:27.700]   your on your hard drive you get to use it for a couple of a couple of weeks maybe even a month
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:32.580]   before they before you got to pay for it and when you got to pay for it it's just 20 bucks it's
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:37.940]   really the only thing ugly about it is that they've got the name of the app downy in the title bar
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:44.980]   in a really really kind of weird font of the main action window and it just looks
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:51.460]   unixy it looks I don't like it I wish they would just switch to something else it's the only thing
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:56.980]   it's the only thing that is not beautifully designed about this otherwise it's so clean so
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:01.860]   nicely done and I was more than happy I was kind of you get kind of excited when you get to give
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:07.300]   someone twenty dollars for something that you really really enjoy and I do I'm not kidding I was
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:11.540]   downloading I had a whole bunch of stuff in my queue that I wanted to watch from I'm gonna be on
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:16.260]   a train for like six hours to DC in a few days and I just had so many things in my queue that was
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:22.340]   just all take the entire queue put it in there even an entire playlist by the way if there are 144
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:28.180]   videos in somebody's opera playlist and you just end you're in the playlist viewer inside youtube
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:33.540]   and you just sort of copy paste one whatever the URL is in the address bar it will ask you well
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:38.100]   this is pointing to one video but there are 144 videos in the playlist do you want me to download
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:43.620]   all 140 videos I can do that for you like already then I would like to have seven and a half days
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:49.060]   worth of opera clips great please give it to me so like I said it's really really really well done
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:52.340]   and I'm very happy to give them 20 bucks for it nice
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:50:02.740]   uh Alex isn't here so I'm I this would be his recommendation the LaSee 12 big Thunderbolt 3
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:11.540]   array from 48 to 96 terabytes at Thunderbolt 3 speeds perfect for your new HP Spectre laptop
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:16.500]   and of course you can't afford it so I'm not even going to tell you the price it's like 100
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:24.260]   Alex's but man wouldn't you like that in your uh I don't know your basement I could use that
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:29.060]   storage now that I have this downloader tool but my recommendation is actually something even more
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:36.580]   dangerous probably hotter Tim Deagan has just released his book make fire now I love the make
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:43.780]   series we get these books all the time uh you know make magazine uh magazine.com publishes books
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:49.620]   on Arjuino Raspberry Pi this is their first book on fire I'm thinking their last I don't know
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:55.380]   but lots of projects of course he focuses on safety it's the subtitle is the art and science
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:02.500]   of working with propane Arjuino controlled propane but of course the one you're going to want to make
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:10.020]   he calls the bush I call it a fire cannon and I think you'll call it delightfully dangerous so
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:16.100]   if you if you've always wanted now he says he says if you've jumped ahead to read this chapter first
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:20.980]   please know that the other chapters and projects provide essential skill and safety information
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:28.100]   do not make the bush as your first project but if you work your way up to the bush I want you
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:36.260]   to send me video okay because this is insanity Leo if if you order this book on amazon is like
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:41.540]   one of the like most most people buy this book also buy like an eyebrow pencil pencil back in
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:44.900]   the features that you're going to send you off after your first three days somebody who has blown
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:51.540]   off some of his hair in the past I I for one relish the opportunity to do an even better job of
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:59.780]   debilitating my forehead uh so yes crazy but uh if you want to make a fire cannon
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:07.460]   have have at it new from make magazine magazine dot com tim dig in the art and science of working
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:18.180]   with propane make fire fire good fire dangerous fire fun like that don't do the things that you
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:27.460]   imagine the fire is telling you to do this is the bush in action okay don't do this in anywhere
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:36.820]   inhabited writing a flame effect permit plan um yeah this probably a good idea this
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:43.060]   oh no I no no no no no chief I didn't get this off the internet I got this off of a book
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:47.780]   I got off the internet I think you'll agree that that comes with a pretty high payer
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:53.940]   everybody should have a venturi burner in their back I don't know how this book got past the
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:58.500]   sensors or whoever it is at make magazine that that pays attention to whether they're going to get
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:05.700]   their ass suit off but uh wow don't you love it I I love that I live in a country where you can
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:10.820]   just pitch an idea like this and the government will say well obviously the free market should
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:17.700]   decide whether or not this is a good idea for a book god bless america hey thanks to rene richy
