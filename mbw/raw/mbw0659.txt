[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   It's a little more nuanced than that and we've got details for you so you can make the decision.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760]   And we're very excited.

[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where you cover the latest news from Apple. And I should
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   a little program note people are asking, "Where is Alex Lindsey?" He's out on assignment. He's doing,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.480]   I don't know the actual story, but I've been kind of hinted at that he's doing some kind of work
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.200]   that would, of necessity, recuse him from the show.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   I believe he's off on the Warriors quest. He's like somewhere like meditating underneath the
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   waterfall. He's walking out with a yacky spirit guide in the desert of the Sonoran Hills. We don't
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.280]   know what he's doing. But thank God Lori Gill is here anyway, because you never see Alex with
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.520]   pink hair ever. Lori Gill, managing editor Imore, we're thrilled to have you as our official
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.280]   replacement. And it could be a long-term assignment from what I gather. So thank you,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840]   Lori, for joining us. Glad to be here. Glad to be invited. I feel special.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.080]   Well, we just love having you on the show so much. And if Alex comes back too bad.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.440]   We're going to fight. Actually, I'm going to drive down there. We're going to fight.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.360]   I think we'd be good. We could have a cage match.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   Only one.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   I have been pumping iron. Lori Gill put him on the table.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.360]   I think it'll be like Dune trivia. That would be, oh, Lori, it went easy.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.720]   That's Andy Inaco, Boston Public Radio's Andy Inaco,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.840]   IHNATKO.com. Thank you for being here. Andrew, and from the frozen north,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.040]   home of the flooding, whatever river you're nearest, Renee Ritchie of iron.com.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.880]   They're truly, because the water is still here. No, the flood is still here. It's higher than ever.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.480]   And they said it's going to snow this week. So I don't even understand. Oh my God.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.720]   Mother nature has gone mad, but you still have the best bagels in the world.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.960]   So that's- We do. We do. We'll take that New York. You went on pizza. We went on bagels.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:53.520]   All right, so the New York Times, maybe not a winner this week. Big article in the New York Times
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   implying that Apple was cracking down on iPhone addiction apps,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   either because one, Apple had its own screen time technology and didn't like the competition,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.800]   or two, because secretly, this was the worst conspiracy theory in the article, secretly,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.040]   Apple wants a watered down iPhone addiction app. They secretly want you to use it more. So they
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.800]   made screen time, which does a little bit of it and is not as draconian as these apps. But the
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.680]   consequence was pretty significant. They said that the Times said that Apple has removed or
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   restricted 11 of the 17 most downloaded screen time and parental control apps.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.920]   In some cases, Apple forced companies remove features. In other cases, it pulled the apps from
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.440]   the app store and they particularly noted our pact, which was the number one parental control
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.280]   app, three million downloads. Our pact 80% of our packs revenue came from the app store.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   They interviewed his the CEO, Amir Musavi, and who said they are systematically killing
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.000]   the industry.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.960]   That sounds bad. You just on the face of it. Well, then somebody emailed Tim Cook and said,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:26.240]   boy, that doesn't sound good. And got a response from Phil Schiller that kind of maybe explained
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.440]   it a little bit better over the last year. We become aware that some parental management apps
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.160]   are using a technology called mobile device management MDM and installing a profile. By the
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.840]   way, our pact did exactly that as a method to limit and control use of these devices. MDM is
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.360]   the same technology we should mention that Facebook was using in that app that spied on what you
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.760]   were doing that Apple yanked. It gives one party access to and control over many devices. It was
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.800]   never meant to be used by apps like our pactor Facebook was meant to be used by a company
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.120]   on its own mobile devices as a management tool where that company has a right to all the data and
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.920]   use of the devices. In other words, a company that gives phones to employees, the MDM technology
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.080]   is not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumer devices.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.840]   But the apps removed from the store did just that. So Apple says,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.520]   A, MDM profiles can be used for hacker attacks. So we're protecting the people who use this app
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.800]   from being attacked and B, it's against our rules and C, these third parties are collecting a huge
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:43.920]   amount of information often about kids. So that's a pretty strong argument. They also later released
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.840]   a press release, which I'll pull up here that says the facts, the facts about parental control
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.520]   apps. The truth about flash.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.160]   It's a first of all, it's a claim, not an argument.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.560]   And second, there are three things that I that kind of got my attention about this
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.520]   beyond the actual subject. One that that's very, very nice that you respond to these claims when
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.760]   a user emails or tweets about it. But when I assume the New York Times asks Apple for a comment,
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.400]   they probably didn't get a comment back. They got a comment which they quote in the article.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.160]   And this is one of the reasons I believe the New York Times, which is so anodyne is to be
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.760]   meaningless. Right. So yeah, I mean, they said here, I'll read you the Apple response, initial
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.480]   response. But all that means is Apple didn't get it together. I don't know. And time well,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.560]   it's when the when the international newspaper of record asks for a comment, you share going to be
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.880]   make it there. They're not they're not bozos. They're not just someone who's going for YouTube
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.480]   clicks. They've got a story that they think is important and they're going for it.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.040]   I'm not sure that's true because Shiller also claimed they didn't run the full comment Apple
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.640]   gave them, which is very like that's not something I'd expect from the Times. And also, I don't
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.240]   have any direct knowledge about this situation. But I do know people who formerly worked in these
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.600]   areas and did deal with it. And we saw this in the big hack where quite often papers that we used
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.680]   to consider papers of record and it was incredible integrity have not listened to any of the responses
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.720]   that the companies have given them, even when the companies have gone over it and over it.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.120]   In effect, they have an incredible detail. They have an agenda. And this is, I think the
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.440]   time this is the statement. No, this is the full statement case, whether this is a full
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.080]   statement. I don't know. But this is the statement that Times quoted from an Apple spokesperson
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:40.000]   named Levine. We treat all apps the same, including those that compete with our own services.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.600]   Our incentive is to have a vibrant app ecosystem that provides consumers access to as many quality
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.480]   apps as possible. It does feel like there might have been a dot dot dot in there.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.320]   However, these apps exactly that says they did not print their statements.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   Yeah, the the Apple press release said when we found out about these guidelines violations,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.560]   we communicated them to the app developers, giving them 30 days to submit an updated app.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.640]   In other words, they could have updated their app removed the MDM content to avoid availability
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.240]   interruption in the app store. Several developers released updates to bring their app in line with
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.640]   these policies. Those that didn't were removed. That seems fair. So Andy, do you do you think that
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:32.000]   Apple, what do you think is going on? I think that we have it's Apple has a problem in moving the
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.560]   either moving the goal post for app acceptance or not screening apps the way that they should the
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.200]   other either number one, they're either they're telling the exact truth as they understand it,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.600]   which meant that they allowed a whole category of apps that violates and threatens user privacy
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.920]   to be on the app store for a good length of time. Or they waved it through because at the time,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.760]   it wasn't very, very important. I think this is a above and beyond this one category of apps.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.880]   This is something that we see all the time when you talk to developers that there's something
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.600]   that got approved. And then when they're doing an update, suddenly something is not okay anymore,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.400]   or they're going to be making them go through hoops to use a different API or different solution
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:25.280]   that the programmers were using for the previous two generations of apps. And it's part and parcel
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   of the problems that programmers have in trying to deal with Apple and getting things into the
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.440]   app store. And the second difficulty here is that, and I don't know that this is necessarily
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.960]   something that we can fault Apple for, but there's a lot of difficulty that comes into play when
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:51.360]   Apple decides to compete with developers one way or another, because Apple will always give itself
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.760]   certain rights and certain privileges that because of security, because of privacy, and because of
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.960]   anything in category three reasons to be named later, that they can't give to the general developer
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.520]   community. So this is always going to be a problem for Apple, where they're saying that developers
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.640]   can't create this kind of an app that absolutely underscores how good the iPhone experience can be,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.160]   but Apple can instead. So if Apple decides to release an app or release a feature,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.200]   that third party developer is never going to be able to compete. So overall, I do believe what
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:36.880]   Apple is saying that they're not trying to make people use iPhones more. They do that through
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.240]   great user experience and great build quality and an emojis. That's how they get people to use
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.960]   their phones more. And I don't think that they're trying to steal profits from developers.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.480]   However, I do think that this illustrates two or three ongoing difficulties that Apple has in
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.280]   running the App Store. Renee, go ahead, Lori. And then I have a question.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   >> In regards to what you're saying, Andy, I think that there's a couple of things that I
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.400]   completely agree with. And maybe one or two things I'm not sure I agree with. One of them being that
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:13.040]   communication between Apple and developers seems to be pretty poor. And specifically in this
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   article or in this situation, the New York Times points out a developer that was trying to receive
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.480]   feedback from Apple saying, what did I do wrong? Tell me what I can do to fix it.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.960]   And didn't receive any clear direction on what they were supposed to do until the last minute.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.280]   Meanwhile, Phil Schiller is emailing somebody who reads Mac rumors immediately to tell them
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.120]   what went wrong. So why are these developers receiving the same amount of immediate interaction?
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.080]   It sounds like if these people are being honest about the situation, it sounds like they did
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.800]   everything they could to try to be in line with what the App Store wants so that they could keep
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:01.760]   their businesses open. I believe that. Nobody's going to try to sneak through the system if they
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.440]   legitimately want their company to stay open. But Apple didn't do anything to help that developer
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.640]   or those developers. They just told them, you're doing it wrong and we'll get back to you if you
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.160]   have any questions and then didn't get back to them and just said, yank, not yours. So I do
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.560]   agree that there needs to be better communication with the developers. Where you're saying that
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:31.040]   Apple is sort of abusing its right to have its own apps in the App Store while pulling other apps
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.720]   that are similar. In this particular situation, I disagree because Apple made it really clear
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.280]   why they pulled these apps. It's not because they're parental controls apps. It's because they are
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:51.360]   apps that violate a very specific privacy feature. Although you did agree, Lori, that Apple
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.640]   reserves certain capabilities to itself. It may not be possible for a third party to make
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:04.560]   an effective parental control app without using MDM. Yes, but I have so many feelings about this.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   That's where it gets to be difficult because on the one hand Apple is saying to these people,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:16.080]   you can't just collect all of this data from children. The only way that we can protect these
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.400]   children and their parents is to stop you from doing it. But on the other hand, there are these
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.640]   parents that are saying, but I should be allowed to decide whether I want these companies to
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.720]   collect this information or not. So it's from the outside looking in, it's like, yeah, I could see
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.160]   why Apple did that for privacy protection. But yeah, I could see why parents want more control
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.880]   over how their children use apps and are willing to take that risk and should be allowed to take
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.640]   that risk. So I have a question.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.040]   There are a couple of points that bother me a little bit about what Apple said.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:15:00.320]   First of all, Apple announced MDM at WWDC 2018. This is not a new technology has been around for a
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.160]   while. Presumably these apps have been using it for a long time. Why did Apple not do something
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.000]   about it until screen time came out? That's one. Two, if this, as Apple says, is such a risky
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.240]   technology that allows hackers access to the phone, why do they let businesses use it? If MDM is so
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.400]   bad, then how come some people can use it? Renee, do you have a response to that?
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.360]   Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of stuff going on here. One of the things is a lot of the things,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.120]   so I want to separate it. I think the article is completely bogus, but I think Apple did a lot
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.440]   of things wrong here and both of those things can be true. Apple took way too long to make
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   screen time so that a lot of companies came in and filled that gap because people absolutely
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.960]   want those features. Because of Apple's security model, they could only do it by using either the
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.280]   kind of certificates that Facebook used or full on MDM. If people still aren't sure about that,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.600]   it's like what a BlackBerry would use in a corporation to manage all the data, all the context,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.720]   all the information on your device, by using MDM technology to do it. It was their way of
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.280]   hacking around the limitations of iOS. In a perfect world, Apple would have made screen time a
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.600]   decade ago and would have had a screen time API nine years ago. I really hope they have a
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.680]   screen time API this year because Apple's usual pattern is introduce a feature,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   test it for a year, then introduce the reliable stable private API. The next year,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.920]   that'll let all these apps do the same functionality in their own way with whatever value add they
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.760]   want to do and in a way that's trustworthy, secure and private for developers. I know the,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.960]   sorry for customers, I know the developers want that too, so that's the proper solution to all this.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.760]   But I think Apple just, they did not care about screen time or didn't even think about screen time
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.240]   because their eye of Sauron was on other features until that article went live in the Wall Street
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   Journal with those packs. I forget they were hedge funds, whatever, saying Apple doesn't care
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.160]   about screen time and then Apple had to spin real quick. And even though they ditched a bunch of
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.120]   features from iOS 12, had to read about resources to getting screen time into iOS 12, and then they
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.320]   looked at the market and went, holy crap, all these people are using MDMs to do this. And if we don't
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.560]   do something, the other article in the New York Times is going to be, Apple fails to act in
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.840]   preserving the privacy of children. And so they had to stumble all over themselves to get this
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.360]   fixed as well. And it's not ideal, but it's, and it's not excusable, but it's the kind of mistake
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.240]   that happens when you're dealing with an ecosystem. Tony's passing it all out quickly is just that
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.000]   Apple has a long history of actually encouraging people to compete with them. Like they're a
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.720]   better mail app, they're Spark mail, there's fantastic, there's Halide camera. And if you do
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.960]   it well, they will give you an Apple design award. They are. And I don't think there's no end of
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.920]   alternative browsers. Apple could say, well, we've got so far, we don't need a feature that
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.480]   you're going to not buy another app based on. Here's what Tony Fidel said in a tweetstorm after
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.720]   the New York Times article that might be a little bit telling. He said, Apple's screen times
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.240]   still has many holes and deficiencies. Their solution was a rush job. It's very non-intuitive
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.480]   to use. And he says, by the way, I don't have a dog in this hunt. I just have kids. So that's
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.680]   my interest. Tony, of course, was a former Apple designer who did the iPod. Apple should be building
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.920]   true. And this, I agree with APIs for screen time. So the privacy concerns are taken into account
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:18.800]   instead of limiting users app store choices. There needs to be an API. And I think that that
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.600]   actually is an excellent doing. Yeah. So that third parties can do this and do it responsibly and
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:30.000]   safely. If Apple really is committed to parental control and screen time management for yourself
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.040]   and for your kids, make an API. There's a health API. And there's a rich ecosystem, by the way,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.360]   of apps that integrate with health as a result. It's an Apple's best interest to make an API.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.120]   It will actually help them sell more iPhones to more people who care about that feature if they
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   have an API for developer. Apple, he writes or tweets. I guess, is that writing? I guess it is.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.040]   Apple, until you have a real API, let the third party apps be available to app store users. These
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.360]   devs are trying to help not steal data. The only reason they have to do what they do
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.400]   is because you don't provide a proper API. In other words, there's no other way for them to do it.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.000]   Sadly, they can't do that once they know about it. If they don't plug it in there,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   MDM gives that company a lot of information about control. Like they literally can turn on
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.120]   and turn off things on your phone. Yeah. And if you're if you want to trust that company that's
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.520]   doing that for you, the parental control company that's doing that for you, then that's wonderful.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:31.280]   But how many companies have we seen that got hacked? So how many chances are there that this
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:39.040]   parental control apping somebody's kids phone or iPad or iPod touch or something gets infected and
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:45.280]   all that information is really used nefariously. Not just like, we can trust our parental controls
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.840]   companies, but can we trust them to protect it too? We're just an employee searching through it.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.880]   Like we saw that with like it wasn't that they were just listening to the words,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.160]   but they were seeing your addresses too. And people don't think about that until it comes out.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:04.000]   Yeah. It's it shows how valuable the developer community is when because they can act a lot faster
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.120]   and respond a lot more quickly than an Apple OS update can. So I really do think that they help
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.960]   the community, the entire user community out by showing here's how rich parental controls can be.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.000]   And here's how aggressive they can be and effective they can be. And I hope that Apple was looking at
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.240]   that while they were developing their own features and improving those old features.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.200]   One thing I'd like to clarify is that I don't I don't think that Apple was
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.240]   wielding the ban hammer on them. What I was trying to get at is that they're going to be
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:41.280]   because of the way that Apple works. It's inevitable that Apple is going to run into problems like this,
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:48.240]   where the Apple Music app is always probably going to be a richer experience than what you
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.960]   can get with a third party app because Apple let's just say that Apple's internal app approval process
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.640]   is a lot more streamlined and the lines of communication are a lot are a lot more more active
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.840]   than they have when talking to other developers. And also because Apple is the highest level of
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.560]   trusted developer, they're always going to grant themselves permissions to get the job done that
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.040]   they're not going to grant other developers. So I'm not saying that I was never saying that
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.240]   Apple is doing anything to try to diminish an outside developer, but this is the sort of
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.400]   headbudding that's always going to happen. So long as Apple is creating their own apps
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.520]   and competing with third party apps that then unfortunately developers are just going to have to
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.840]   find a way to live, drive and survive inside that environment.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   But that's where it's gets really dangerous though if you build your livelihood on this app that
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.040]   saw success and then without you knowing what went wrong, Apple destroys your business.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:54.720]   I think that's the thing that's a little not disappointing, but it is. It's disappointing to
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.240]   hear that there are companies that just completely lost their business because they didn't,
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.560]   things weren't properly done so that they could fix it in order to keep their app in.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:16.000]   Obviously they can now fix that problem and remove the MDM and re-present it to Apple for review
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.360]   and get their business back on track. So obviously it doesn't mean they're going to go under and
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.200]   never have any more money and their business is shut down and now they have to go work at McDonald's.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:32.320]   But when you get your app into the app store, it's been there for 10 years, it's making plenty of
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:39.360]   money and then just without you really understanding what went wrong, Apple says no and takes it away
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.960]   from you. That's a really frustrating experience for a developer, especially coming from a company
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:51.600]   that heavily promotes how important it is that app developers are part of the community and I know
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.280]   it's difficult in such a huge ecosystem, but I do think Apple could have done a better job of
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.080]   communicating with these app developers. And if they did, because this is just information that
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.840]   we get from people who was feelings were hurt because their app was pulled and maybe they
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.800]   aren't being as honest as they could be about the situation. But if that's true, it's clear that
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.400]   Apple needs better to communicate better directly with app developers.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.960]   There's a platform problem in general that we have because you have these giant companies,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.520]   whether it's Amazon or Google or Facebook or Apple, and there are obvious holes in what they
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.640]   offer and we've talked to people too and my boss will say this, there's a big hole in this market,
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.720]   but it's also obvious that it's a big hole and if it's obvious to us, it's obvious to that company
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.640]   and they're going to fill it. So the question becomes, can we make enough money fast enough
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.880]   before they fill it that we're going to be okay when they choose to fill it? And we see that with
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.040]   Google, we see that with Facebook, we see that with Amazon and we absolutely see that with Apple.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.880]   And it's where the lines start to blur behind built-in capabilities and open opportunities for
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.120]   developers. And some will gladly tell you they never just they never want to set up their business
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.720]   under the foot of a drunken giant. And there's your show title.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:11.440]   Let's take a break. You know what? This is why the show is great is this was a complicated subject.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   I think the Times got it wrong, but I think Apple's response wasn't completely informative.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.080]   And I think the nuances of this were very well laid out by you guys. The first part was terrible
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.680]   when Apple says that there are still that because the apps that are still there are terrible.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.640]   I would have led with the Phil Schiller things and we're going to work with developers to make
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.800]   a better solution immediately. That would have been my lead. Yeah. Yeah. Do an API. You know,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.760]   you got one for health. It makes perfect sense. Let's take a break. We've got lots more including
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:45.040]   the answer to a question we posed last week. But first, a word from Hover. It's time to register
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:54.080]   a domain name. I just read a great piece by a developer who said, if you don't have your own
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:00.800]   domain, your own website, you are letting other people tell folks who you are online. That's
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.680]   especially true when you go out and look for a job. It actually came up for him because he was
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.480]   looking for a technical job. And the guy said, well, I don't see a lot of you on the web. You've got
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:18.160]   to have a place to go that you put your best stuff. And it's not Facebook or Twitter. It's not Snapchat.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.040]   It's your own website. But the first thing you've got to do is to register the domain name.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.080]   And Hover is the place to do it. They don't do websites. They're not going to upsell you to
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.920]   a thousand different things. They're a domain registrar, which means they're the place to go to look for
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:39.600]   a domain name like a dot me. I have Leo Laporte dot me. That is a they have over 400 domain
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   extensions. But I like dot me because it really tells you if you want to put a portfolio up or a
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.440]   page about yourself, your name dot me is a great extension to use a portfolio website.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.560]   You know, if you're a high school kid and you want to put your awards, your best papers, your best
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:03.440]   work, get that dot me extension. I just did a search on Hover for Laporte. And now I have a
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.160]   lot of the Laporte extensions. But here's Laporte dot Inc, Laporte dot site, Laporte dot page. How
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:17.600]   about Laporte dot baby? Now, I think that's a great gift for somebody who's having a baby to give
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:24.720]   them a baby site, Laporte dot guru. Oh, I got to get this from mom, Laporte dot mom, Laporte dot
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.000]   moe, Laporte dot Desi, Laporte dot Democrat, Laporte dot Republican, Laporte dot soy.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.480]   I mean, this goes on and on. There are so many if you're a dentist, get the dot dentist. If
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:43.120]   you're an attorney, get the dot attorney or the dot lawyer dot company. There are so many great
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.440]   domain names at Hover. Thought me is a great place to start. As I said, I have Leo Laporte dot
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:54.240]   me and I like it. By the way, the thing I love about Hover, their support is first class. When you
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.880]   go to Hover and you buy a domain name, you don't get page after page of upsells. No,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.760]   it's a clean and simple user experience and interface. And the DNS couldn't be easier to manage. So,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.560]   in fact, they make it even easier than that because if you want to attach your domain to, say,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:19.120]   WordPress.com or any other of a dozen different sites, Hover Connect lets you do it with a few
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:26.480]   simple clicks. So, here's InsideTwit. And I can look at the DNS. I can assign it. Right
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.720]   now, it's DNS simple. Hover will do the DNS as well, but most often will assign it to a larger.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.560]   And by the way, I love these forwards. Like, if you did InsideTwit.com/weather, you could
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.080]   forward it to the weather network or actually it already is InsideTwit.com/movies goes IMDB.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   Well, forwards are a great way to forward your email. For instance, Hover, by the way,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:55.840]   has a very good email service. Just $20 a year, you get 10 gigabytes, $29 a year, you get a
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.880]   terabyte of storage. So, when you get the domain name, you can even have your email attached to it.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.160]   This year, find the domain name for your passion. Hover.com/twit.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.880]   That's a special URL to get 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension for the entire
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:20.400]   first year. 10% off at hover.com/twit. We thank Hover for supporting Twit. I, all my domains are
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.880]   registered at Hover, except for the few I can't get off those other guys. Hover. Some of these
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.800]   other guys are kind of skisily sticky. If you don't know what I mean, hover.com/twit
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.200]   get 10% off and you're supporting us by using that special domain name.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:44.960]   So, we had a question. Go ahead, Andy. I just out of renewed a few hover domains that I bought
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.560]   as late as five years ago because they're really cool domains. And at $10, $15 a year,
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.880]   I'm willing to continue to be the domain owner of Chairman Honeycrisp.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.600]   Go to park them. Chairman Honeycrisp, do you have that, really?
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.360]   As soon as Colbert said that, I said, that might be an interesting domain to have.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.640]   Well, I'll give you an example. If you're a ham, you can, and I think this is a really good
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:15.360]   thing to do. You can register your call sign. I'm w6twt.org. Actually, I'm .net.org and
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.400]   a bunch of other things. So, that's another nice way to do this. If you're a ham to take your ham
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.160]   call sign and get that domain name, I think it's really a great thing to do.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.200]   So, we wondered last week, which came first, the chicken or the egg, which came first,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.840]   Apple and Qualcomm's settlement in court or the announcement that Intel was no longer going to do
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   5G modems. Well, Intel says it was after the settlement, and it wasn't long after.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.600]   Right? It was just a few hours after the settlement that they decided, "We're okay,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.800]   good. We can get out of this mobile 5G thing. We're done." Then we had none.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.040]   Bob Swan, the new CEO at, I think he was in a room and now he's official, I don't know,
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:10.160]   at Intel said the company concluded there just wasn't any money in the business
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.200]   after Apple and Qualcomm settled their ongoing dispute. In quote, this is an interview in the
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.880]   Wall Street Journal. In light of the announcement of Apple and Qualcomm, we assessed the prospects
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.520]   for us to make money while delivering this technology for smartphones, included at the time
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.760]   we just didn't see a path. Nobody was going to pay us.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:34.240]   It's a harder thing to do than we thought. Our modems really aren't very good,
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.760]   which even Apple admitted privately, not publicly.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.840]   And they weren't there adjacent stories where Apple declined to buy their, or they couldn't
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.000]   come to a deal to buy their modem technology, but their head of development is not what Apple
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.680]   had. Yeah, there's one way to do it. Hire, don't acquire.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.360]   Yeah, so anyway, that's the answer to that. It's rare. Often we have these
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.760]   questions about the inner workings of something like that, and you don't know for decades.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.080]   We only learned who Deep Throat was like 10 years ago.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.880]   And so you think, well, someday, if I live long enough, I will know. Well, no, no, day later,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.760]   you'll find that. I was at the NS North Conference this weekend, and they had Ken Kishinda talking,
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.840]   and he's wonderful. And he was telling the story again of how he made the iOS keyboard.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.280]   And somebody asked why it took so long to get to cut and paste. And he said, well,
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.120]   I was the one engineer working on the keyboard, and I wanted to do it. I just couldn't finish it
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.200]   in time for launch. And then in year two, I had to make the API because suddenly we were, you know,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.800]   we had an app store to put out. So it took all of us just to get the app store ready.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.680]   Then in year three, I could sit down and make the coffee. This still baffles me. We've always
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.400]   said that there's a limited number of people. And they can't. And you knew that, like, I remember
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.080]   reading that the was it the Apple remote apps that the guy who wrote it was reassigned. So it
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:56.560]   didn't get updated for years. And then finally, he went back to it. And Apple is a, it's a,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.920]   one of the biggest companies in the world with thousands of engineers and still, why is that?
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.720]   There's a lot of work on all the stuff. You don't want any. Yeah. And you don't want just
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.600]   anybody working on your stuff. You want that person who did an amazing job working on that. So,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.680]   you know, I like the remote app is a great example. Are you just going to throw some
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.520]   rando on there and just hope they did it right? You're going to want that original guy that
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.360]   designed it to go back and make sure that it's, you know, kind of perfect. I think
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:30.080]   that's kind of the key here is that the good designers do the great work, but they, there aren't
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.960]   as many of them, you know, there's a saying that the perfect is the enemy of the good
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   that you can, you could be so perfectionist that you don't, you don't even ship.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   And maybe Apple, like a remote Apple, honestly, they could easily be written by somebody else.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.000]   I think a second year computer science student could write the remote app.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.440]   I mean, that was the gateway. You had to present to Greg Christie. If he was okay with
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.320]   he had to present to Scott and if Scott was okay with it, had to go to Steve and Steve
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.440]   wanted to know who to blame for each and every component on each and everything that he cared
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.240]   about. And when Steve needs one person, Steve means one person and that now it doesn't work
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.400]   quite that way. But back then, that's the way Steve wanted. And that was an example of the
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.360]   enemies that perfectly good, which Jobs knew the perfect is the enemy of the good.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.560]   That Jobs knew that because he also said great artists ship. Yeah, he knew that you can,
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.200]   you got to ship too. Yeah, you got to ship. You can be, you know, you can really be doing a great
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   amazing, perfect job. But eventually you have to ship a product and it's not going to be perfect.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.800]   But you got to look at like what is the luminary we were talking about last week, they have 30
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.320]   engineers working on an app that at Apple would be done by one and a half people.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.840]   Luminary, which is that podcast app got a lot of heat this week too. Yeah. Did you ever figure out
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:50.160]   how that was working out? Yeah. So thanks to Marco Arman, who really kind of called Luminary
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.440]   out on the carpet. So let's just give you the background real quickly, Luminary.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:00.800]   A podcast app, they raised $100 million for an app, a second year computer science student could write.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.440]   And but they had a business model. And this is what Spotify is planning to do too of
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:13.920]   paid exclusive apps. Their plan is, I think it's seven or eight dollars a month. And you'll get
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.760]   access to special podcasts. I said apps, I meant podcast, special podcasts that aren't available
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.160]   if you don't pay and presumably add free. And then just like Spotify, they'll be if
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.440]   ad supported tier, which will include all the other podcasts. I don't have a problem with that.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:38.960]   But somebody noticed, maybe it was Marco and tweeted, Hey, wait a minute, when I go to
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:45.040]   Luminary to download my podcast, it's not linking to my podcast. It's linking to Luminary proxy servers.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:51.200]   At first, they thought Luminary was storing the podcast. And this is something that for years,
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:58.160]   we fought because I know some small podcasts like the idea you host us because it's expensive to do
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.880]   hosting. But we always wanted to host our own shows. We always want to control of that. So any
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.800]   time an app came along, and they have come along and said, well, we'll host it for you. We'd say no.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.960]   But Luminary turns out wasn't doing that. But by proxying, they were they were basically, if
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:18.560]   somebody download anybody downloads from Luminary will come from one of a handful of IP addresses,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:24.560]   all Luminary addresses. So the way this is complicated, but excuse me for the inside baseball,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.480]   but the way podcasts figure out downloads, you can't just look at your log and say, well,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.960]   it was downloaded a billion times. Although many podcasts do that because that number is very big.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.520]   It turns out many, many podcast applications will download will open multiple streams.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:46.720]   So the so you may have five different downloads from one person. And so you can't count that.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.440]   You and the way you avoid that is we call it IP address deduplication when we see the same
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:57.600]   IP address within a certain amount of time, like say, one hour, we only counted as one download
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.640]   because we figure, well, their podcast client is open five threads. And so we're not going to
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.200]   count it. So deduplication is really important to the counting of podcasts. And there's quite an art
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.120]   in the length of time. You know, if you make it too long, then you're going to miss downloads.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.600]   You make it too short, you're going to get too many downloads. I think we found that one hour
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.200]   was about right. There's other problems too, like everybody who is downloading Windows Weekly and
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.840]   works at Microsoft and is downloading in the Microsoft Campus shows up as one IP address. Every Apple
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.800]   employee who downloads this show at Apple shows up as one IP address apples. So we don't get to
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.120]   count them. So we know we're under counting. But counting is important because that's how we sell
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.000]   the ads, the advertisers pay by the number of impressions. So it's important that we get a
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.800]   as accurate account as we can. And we know that we're slightly under. I'd rather be under than over.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.200]   I don't want to over. I don't want to inflate our numbers. So the issue with Luminary is you
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.040]   would be able to you would get five downloads. But who knows if you had a million users using
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.920]   Luminary, you'd still only get five different IP addresses. You couldn't you couldn't count them.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:06.880]   So Luminary responded. Thank you, Marco. He said and Luminary said, Oh, sorry, our bad. And they
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.760]   changed it. They fixed it. Yeah. There was also the issue. And I still don't understand this that
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.080]   somehow they were stripping out of show notes. They were stripping links out. So podcasts that,
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.880]   for instance, were soliciting support on Patreon. There was no the link was the text was there,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.640]   but the link no longer worked. There were only 30 engineers there. They couldn't do everything.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:33.120]   So long story short, a lot of podcasts pull out of Luminary. We decided not to once we heard
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.720]   that they weren't going to proc they weren't they weren't going to proxy the request anymore
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.480]   that we would be able to count them. I want to be everywhere our listeners are. So that's fine with
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:47.200]   me. I still don't get the idea of this app, particularly when you got this app that's going to be competing
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.680]   with Marco's app, we are also going to be competing with pocketcasts. Some of the
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:38:00.960]   really some of the most high churn rate, increasing sophistication year by year apps are in the
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.200]   podcast realm. And this the the idea of starting from from ground from ground zero, creating any
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.480]   kind of a new podcast app without the legacy of someone who's been listening to users for years
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.360]   and years and years, and also figuring out how to make an app that makes sense across multiple
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.640]   domains, across multiple platforms. That's even before you start talking about, okay,
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.200]   what shows are you going to give me this going to be worth my giving you eight to nine dollars a
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.800]   month? I just don't get it. I heard an explanation. I forget who it was from, but someone laid it out.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.280]   It's like there is just a group of people and venture capitalists who want to hear will be the
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.440]   Netflix of something. And if you can say will be the Netflix of podcasts, even though it makes
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.760]   no sense to anybody who actually understands how podcasts traditionally work with RSS feeds and
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.520]   you know, anyone can say all those things. They just hear that they've heard of cereal,
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.600]   they've heard of podcasts, they've heard of Netflix, and it just sounds like money. So they just do it.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:59.200]   It's also possible. I think this is Spotify's modification. It might have been
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:04.000]   motivation. It might have been Luminaire's motivation. If you could, for instance,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.240]   get a podcast by somebody huge. I mean, maybe Joe Rogan or maybe Howard Stern. Let's say you got
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.800]   the Howard Stern podcast. He doesn't do him. You could reasonably get maybe a million people
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.480]   subscribing in eight bucks a month for that. If that's the only way you could get it.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.040]   Is that so that was the big, is that a podcast? Is that an audio show or whatever it is?
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.280]   Cast one's just no longer RSS. Yeah, if you can't put it on your iPod, it's not a podcast. I don't
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:38.320]   know. But the big deal is that the big deal there is that you talk about cost of customer
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.720]   acquisition and how much are you going to have to pay Joe Rogan to join your platform? And he's
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.200]   smart enough to know that he's bringing more to the platform than the platform is bringing to him.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.680]   There's a difficulty with all of these people who are like the top YouTubers, the top podcasters
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.360]   that by the time they become one of the top podcasters, they're not just somebody
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:07.040]   in their garage, even if they are literally in their garage podcasting, they are a corporation
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.920]   that knows how to run this as a business. You can't really give them anything that they don't
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:18.240]   already have. So they have their own distribution. They have their own, they can sell their own ads.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:27.040]   They can do whatever they want. The old 1950s, 60s, 70s record producer idea of,
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.600]   hey, but you're not going to be able to get into all those stories. You're not going to be able to
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   get on the radio unless you sign a record deal with us. That's way in the past.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.360]   It's kind of old fashioned, isn't it? Yeah. And now people don't even want that anymore.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.680]   They say, why would I want to sign up with people who are going to maybe take a day to
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.240]   post something or going to give me guff if I make a certain statement or tell me about a certain
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.640]   advertiser that's pulling out because of something that I'm saying won't let me advertise my own
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:59.520]   custom logo socks as half of the show. Ironically, Joe Rogan pulled his podcast from Luminary.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:05.040]   So I think he's not available. He was peeved. In fact, there was a great article in
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:11.920]   Neiman Labs in there, a hot pot, pot newsletter. Why? What does Luminary's very bad week? Tell us
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:19.840]   about podcasters, collective power. Thanks to Marco Arment, Frederico Vitichy, Joe Rogan,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:28.240]   Barstool Sports, podcast one, which is an aggregator. This was a very bad week for Luminary. I love
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:35.840]   this illustration Monday, the 22nd launch day. Woohoo Tuesday, call Marco Barbara, Michael Marbaro.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:41.840]   He's the host of the daily, which also declined. We can work it out Wednesday. Check if anybody
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.080]   in the office has an email for Joe Rogan Thursday. Check with server guy. What's the
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:52.480]   difference between caching and hosting? Friday. Ask Dave, URLs, are they important?
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   Saturday, call Tim at Apple back. Sunday. And I don't get this. You guys have to explain it to me.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:07.360]   So am I wrap a port? Oh, I'm not the stage play. I'm not wrap a port. Oh, okay. I don't know what
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.760]   the rest of that has to do with podcasting. But hey, thanks to Marco Arment. I'm going to give him a
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.000]   anyway. I don't know what's going to happen to Luminary. We're on Luminary. That was one problem.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   If you pulled your podcast off Luminary, then they replaced your podcast with a big thing saying,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.640]   well, these guys won't let you listen to your podcast or on Luminary. So here's some other
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.920]   podcast you might like better. So I don't want to be in that game either. That's, you know,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.640]   this is a stinky company. I don't like them, but I'm perfectly happy to be there. Because
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.920]   if that's how you want to listen, go right ahead. However, we might recommend Marco Arment's
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   overcast as being an excellent alternative. And so I'm going to give him a plug because he did a
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.800]   good thing for all of us. And I also might point out, and he is a podcaster, which has a lot to do
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.240]   with it. But he's added a new feature in overcast, which we showed on iOS today, which is huge for
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.160]   podcasts. There's a share button when you're listening to a podcast, but it doesn't just share
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:09.200]   the link, which it could, but it could also share literally an audio clip from the show. It gives
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.120]   you a little trimmer that you so if something cool happens in a show that you want to share on
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.600]   Twitter, by the way, that's really great to do for a podcast. It's the best. That's one of the
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.320]   things podcasts are a little bit behind blogs and other text stuff. You can't really easily share a
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.520]   quote from a podcast. So overcast has added something that and I this comes from being a
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:34.080]   podcaster understanding podcast, which Luminary clearly does not. It's a super exciting time
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:40.400]   for podcasting. But also because Google is very, very close to finishing its technology for being
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.040]   able to index the content of podcasts. So if you do a search for a podcast, it will get it will also
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.200]   tell you that, Hey, there the the show notes of this this week's Mac break said nothing about a
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.320]   20 minute conversation about different versions of episode four of Star Wars, but they wound up
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:03.600]   getting distracted and talking about episode four of Star Wars. God bless them all.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:13.680]   God bless them all. Everyone. So but I do see paid podcasts in the few not for us ever,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:19.520]   and I promise, but in the future because of Spotify, they spent $230 million on Gimlet.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.560]   You better believe they're planning to figure out how to put reply all or something behind a
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.600]   paywall. I mean, they've got to get some of that money back.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:34.160]   Maybe I'm misunderstanding it, but there's already there's already podcast companies that have
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.480]   premium tiers that include exclusive service. I'm not sure why this is different than that
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:45.680]   like Stitcher with, you know, very much like what Stitcher does. So why is Luminary sort of like
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.800]   the bad dog in in something that already exists? Well, they were the bad dog because they hit
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:56.320]   downloads. I mean, that really was bad. Stitcher does not do that. But yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.200]   talking about the pay the paywall thing. Right. That seems to be a contentious thing for for
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.480]   some people is which is that, you know, why should I pay for something that I already get for free?
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.800]   And and you know, how do I know I'm going to love these shows if I don't get to listen to them for
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.760]   free first or something like that? I think I'm still a little confused on how what Luminary is
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.440]   doing aside from the mistakes they made, but just as a general idea how how it's special and
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.680]   different because it's acting like it's one of a kind and I don't think it is.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.320]   It's just picking an old wound like a lot of people in the podcast.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:35.280]   Are used to watching Leo and Dave, like all the people who originated podcast and made RSS and
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.440]   they like it is a huge part. I don't want to call it like the hippie granola crunching original
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.920]   internet people, but there are people who believe that this podcast is something that has an RSS
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.240]   feed and that you can put that into any podcast. It's almost like email. You can put it into any
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.560]   podcast feed and get it and that's yes, there's iMessage and WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger,
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.520]   but that's not email. Email is still free, damn it, and I'm going to plant my flag in it and it's
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.800]   the same thing with podcasts. Yes, there'll be audio proprietary audio shows, but podcasts are free.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.560]   Well, and I don't have any problem with podcasts and there are great many, including many of my
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.880]   friends that use Patreon and say, yeah, voluntarily, optionally, if you'd like to support us,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.640]   you can give us some money. I think that's a we did that early on before we took advertising.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.000]   We had a tip jar. I wish Patreon had existed because there was no easy way to do that.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:30.400]   However, we did do that. I like the idea of ad supported podcasts. I don't know if paid podcasts.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:37.280]   I don't know if I dislike that. It's just something, the reason we don't do it and never would do it
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:45.200]   is actually much more basic than we want to be free. I remember Kevin Rose used with
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:51.280]   Ignatian, his very, very popular podcast, offer paid subscribers, advanced access. So they'd get
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   it a couple of days early, but we have such a technologically sophisticated audience,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.040]   so did Ignatian that somebody would just download it and make it available.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   And so there was, they realized, well, there's no way we can charge for this because they'll
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.480]   just put it online. And so I don't want to play whack-a-mole with people putting special content online.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:16.000]   So I'm not going to charge you because I just can't stop you from distributing it. In fact,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.080]   I like being in the position of saying, good, the more the better, distribute it all you want.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.640]   Give it to your friends. That's a good position to be in.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.920]   We leave and leave it on Luminary. I don't mind.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.200]   It goes back to that great Ben Thompson article about some things,
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.280]   like traditional television, we're good with ads and other things like live sports and live.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.720]   You know, there's different kinds of models for different kinds of content that end up being
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.440]   better, more harmonious with those content types.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.240]   Yeah. Well, apparently our content's worth exactly what you pay for it.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.320]   But you do pay with your attention and you pay by listening to ads. And you know what really works
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.800]   for podcasts is the fact that, in fact, I've been saying it lately in the ads,
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:03.200]   listeners of podcasts are so attached to the podcast, they support the podcaster by using those
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.840]   special URLs and those special links. And it's much more effective. And I know you all do podcasts,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:13.360]   so you know this. It's your relationship with the audience that makes podcasts so good for
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:19.120]   advertisers. It's also why we're, I don't know about you guys, but we're very picky about advertisers
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:25.680]   because inevitably, you the listener will blame me if it doesn't work out.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.120]   If you don't like that mattress, you're not going to send an email to Casper. You're
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.120]   going to send it to me. So I don't want to introduce you to something you're not going to like.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:42.640]   It's a two-way street. We want to make sure we preserve our appeal and our trustworthiness
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.240]   more than anything by only recommending stuff we use and really like.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:52.560]   That's why podcasting is good. Let's see.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:49:02.320]   I'm looking for, oh, Apple has announced that they're going to do the keyboard replacements
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:08.880]   in store. Yeah. Does that mean they're getting stuck within a day? Yeah, given that they don't
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.240]   have any problems with the keyboards, that's kind of an interesting thing to do.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:19.520]   Yeah. Leo, everybody is satisfied. It's just a small number of annoying people.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:28.080]   I have the double double click for double type for the T and the I and my keyboard and my Macbook
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:34.400]   Pro. I've been avoiding to get an in specifically because I was a little concerned with how long
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:40.160]   it was going to take to get it fixed. I found out that this program, thank you to everybody on
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:47.280]   Twitter who told me about that, that the program is kind of, they've been directed to do it fast.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:54.720]   So I did take my Macbook Pro into Apple last week, last Friday. In the store, they did a quick
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.160]   cleaning job and just kind of tried to, that's step one. You don't immediately get your keyboard
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.360]   replaced. Step one is they do kind of just a quick reconnaissance. They clean it out.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   Unless they can manufacture it themselves, which on mine, it's intermittent. So sometimes that
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.040]   would happen and sometimes it wouldn't and they couldn't recreate that in the store. So they just
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:21.120]   did a good cleaning for me. It was wonderful and fast and I was very happy with it so far.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.840]   So far, but you know, that's the problem with mine is that it's not every time. So
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:32.640]   for now, it's good. We'll see what the next step is. But the person that helps me was very clear
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.760]   about next steps. If this happens again, we have this on file and we'll take care of the
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.920]   next step. So they won't do a second cleaning. They'll say, okay, yeah, it's a problem. So how
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.160]   do they clean it with compressed air? They took it in the back. I have no idea what they did.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.520]   Yeah, they do what's in the tech support article. I've talked to a lot of people who've done it
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.680]   at home too. And you everything except for the space bar key, I think the space bar key don't
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   mess with the other ones come off. And I've done that. I did that with mine that was giving me
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.960]   trouble because I didn't want to wait the week either. So I popped the key off. I compressed air.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:08.720]   Did I popped it back on and worked fine ever since. So it's crumbs getting in there above the new
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:14.560]   membrane. Yeah, I mean, my suspicion is that they designed these to be they designed these in a
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.600]   way to prevent things from getting in, but they weren't successful. And then things that get in
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.480]   now don't come out. And that's like sort of like the ultimate paradox in these keys. So you just
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.360]   got to open it up and spray them out. Maybe should have put two people on the keyboard design team.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:33.440]   I mean, that's all the story, right? Like there's there's three ID people leaving, which is
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:39.440]   unprecedented. Laurie finished your thought because I was just noting that I use compressed
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.800]   air on my keyboard because that is recommended by Apple. But I did not pop the key off because
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:50.320]   I don't want to ruin my keyboard. So I didn't have the nerve to actually pop the keys off.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:56.080]   All right, Renee, when you pop the keys off, any tips there, I'm not recommending it for the
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.840]   faint of heart, by the way, you can break them. I mean, because that's always my fear is that
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.760]   you'll break the switch. The key is the space bar will break. The space bar will absolutely break.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:09.280]   So don't do that. I Yeah, I didn't break it. But like if you do break it, it's not like a
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.240]   standard Apple care repair. So on you, if you break it. Yeah, I mean, like, I just did it because I
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.480]   was doing the video and I wanted to be a completist and I'm not normal and don't follow what I do.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:23.120]   But I do know people who have done it and people who do do it. So
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:28.160]   somebody playing the didgeridoo in your house. No, they're putting up so they have a whole
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.560]   bunch of caterpillars outside that are building these massive earth walls out in the water. And
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.640]   now they're doing something to reinforce something that broke and I don't know what's been going on.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.480]   You're putting up arms? Are you afraid of shock and awe? What is there calling them dikes?
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.560]   But then one of the dikes broke and all the water came back in. So they had caterpillars out all
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:51.760]   night. You're like Holland, pretty soon you'll be raising tulips. What is going on? The dikes
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.400]   are putting in dikes in Montreal. Well, these big it's not real. They're like temporary. They
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.560]   have like sandbag and these are just giant earth movers that are dumping a huge amounts of dirt
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.640]   and not like not like you have in a country that wants to do it for like fun and resort space.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.680]   But they'll be permanent. Well, they you're not going to come back and clean them up.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.880]   They didn't do it very well. So I'm guessing those are a melt away into the water after a while.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.560]   Jesus does not sound good.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.400]   Higher beavers. I understand you've lost them up from Canada.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:25.040]   Is there any way to turn the the berms into pokey stops? Because that'd be worthwhile.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.640]   Or how are you potter taverns? Yeah, I mean, I'm so jealous that there's people who live next
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.920]   door to a pokey stop and they could just set their pokey ball. You do?
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.080]   It's right across the street. So you just turn on a you get a guy get a pokey ball if you don't
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.680]   have one because you just turn it on and they will collect that every five minutes. Yep.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.120]   I got to the point where like my bag was just to completely full.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.320]   Yeah. I couldn't I couldn't spend any more pokey stops because it was
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.760]   I got a tip for you. I always could do it. You always have too many red balls.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:58.800]   Just throw out hundreds of red balls and then you put the then you're auto harvesting.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:05.280]   It's a me. I'm so jealous. Renee and I have to work in a rural area with no pokey stops nearby.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.120]   It's like Lori is like battery farming Pokemon. Yes, exactly.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   So have you stalled the Wizard's Unite APK yet? Mr. Renee Ritchie? No, it's I'm not I just can't
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.400]   really take some too much of my time. You can't do it on life on you can only do it on your
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.400]   own. You can only do it on your own. Oh, yes. APK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you have an android
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.560]   device. You did it right? Carsten? I did it. There's still nothing is happening.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.200]   There's no stops or anything. There's no stops or anything. You have to be in the beta for
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:39.440]   something to happen. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Well, it's it's coming on in every day that the Wizard
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:45.200]   Council needs my help to find found in my area. And then I open it and there are no found. No
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:53.040]   foundables soon soon. I can't wait till this game comes out. I'm a million points away from
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.480]   level 40 and Pokemon go and I promised myself I wouldn't do a Harry Potter until I got to 40.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.880]   But once you get to 40 in Pokemon go, what else? What's their left to live for? Getting all your
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.720]   metals, getting all your polka decks, your living polka decks, your shiny don't get me started.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:15.440]   Leo, it's just that stuff. You guys have to go ahead. Maybe Niantic is actually waiting to put out
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:21.040]   for me. In the game until you reach level 40. So you better get on that. I hope not. I hope not.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:27.360]   It is out now in New Zealand and Australia. There were rumors that it was it was out in
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:34.400]   us in Thailand. They usually put out a new country on Friday. Right. So anyway,
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.720]   yeah. So yeah, we're still we're still waiting. Did it actually come out in Australia? Because
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.920]   what happened last I heard is that fake email. Yeah. It was an well actually what happened was
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.360]   they they accidentally sent out an email saying that you could get it, but you couldn't.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.560]   Then they actually released it on accident and then pulled it like an hour later.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:00.800]   So I didn't I don't think I've heard that it's actually it's not actually an era in Australia yet.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:10.480]   So much. Stakes happen mistakes happen. Patience. It is going to be I think is much more complicated
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.400]   and evolved game than a Pokemon go. Yeah. I think fear is that because Pokemon go we talked about
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.040]   this last time media clearing Pokemon bankruptcy is that it gets so involved it no longer becomes
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.280]   like it's not a fun thing anymore becomes data management and then I'm like, yeah, I can't.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.240]   No, you don't want to be grinding in any game. Yeah. So I was doing so much grinding. Yeah.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.400]   I kind of worried that just looking at the gameplay from my New Zealand that it might have
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.720]   the wizard's unite might be a little grindy. If I have to get Ron Weasley stew every 15 minutes,
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:45.040]   I'm going to. All right. Let's take a little break and then we will talk about the design team
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:53.200]   because there's something going on over at ID. But first, I want you to calm down, take a deep breath,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:57:00.000]   get all the anxiety out. We don't want you to suffer in our next story. So go to calm.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.040]   Dot com actually. I'm a calm pro subscriber comp premium. I guess they call it subscriber.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:12.960]   I really love it. Calm is getting better and better all the time.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:21.600]   Not only with it was the app of the year, Apple in 2017, but it's come so far since then they
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:28.640]   have so much now and calm. There are still that guided meditations and the daily new one every day,
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:34.880]   daily meditations. But also there's a wide selection of master classes. This is so cool.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   Master classes on conscious parenting, gratitude, discovering happiness, rethinking depression,
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:48.080]   social media and screen addiction. Oh, dear, I think I might have to take that one.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:57.280]   And a lot more. There's the calm body. I love this. 10 minute guide. I had this is new too. And I'm
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:04.400]   really excited about it. Guided video lessons. Their video. A morning stretch, evening stretch,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:11.840]   back care, mindful warm up before you go work out. Oh, this is just this is just so awesome.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.600]   I'm Kristi. I'm from calm here to guide you through a mindful warm up.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.520]   It's a dynamic full body routine to set you up for your workout.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:25.120]   We'll activate key muscles, improve your range of motion, increase your heart rate and focus your
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:30.960]   mind. I love these. Now they're all audio, which means get calm on your iPhone. And you can listen
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:37.280]   as you work out. You can listen as you go to sleep. Who doesn't love having a bedtime story
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:44.480]   read to you? Calm has bedtime stories, all kinds of bedtime stories, including children's classics,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:52.240]   like the velveteen rabbit tours of famous places, Jerome Flynn from Game of Thrones.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.800]   Good evening. Ron is going to narrate.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.560]   And Jerome Flynn. And tonight, I'll be reading you a sleep story called
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.080]   sacred New Zealand. It's actually a tour of New Zealand.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.200]   Between filming Game of Thrones and my own travels, I've had the honor of visiting some
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:14.160]   remarkable places around the world. I would listen to Braun all night and know that I'm safe.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:21.680]   That the cell sword is going to protect me. What a great selection of stuff. There's also music.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.680]   I was thrilled when I saw that Moby has released his new album exclusively
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:33.280]   on calm.com. Isn't that cool? So if you want to hear Moby's latest, which is some ambient music,
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:41.280]   designed for work or meditation or sleep, I like having actually as I work because
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.080]   it doesn't distract you from your work, but it does let you kind of focus
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:52.720]   without the distraction. I think that's really, really cool. How about some ambient music?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:57.360]   This is Moby's. It's got a great name to L.A. 12.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:07.840]   So what a great way of using your phone in so many wonderful ways to go to sleep, to relax,
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.480]   to work, to exercise. Calm is the perfect mindfulness app, whether you're a beginner,
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.680]   meditating or an expert. And there's hundreds of programs for intermediate and advanced users.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:26.720]   I love calm. 200,000 five star reviews. I guess I'm not alone. I think people really love calm.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:33.040]   Get back your calm with the number one to the daily calm rate of that. Today we'll be exploring
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.960]   the meaning of the word Shampa. Don't know what Shampa means, but later tonight, I will find out

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.760]   And getting to sleep sometimes is hard. They have these scenes too, which if you've got a
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:20.560]   iPad pro or a bigger iPad, you can you can see the let's the silent earth. See, you can have
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.320]   these scenes running in the background, which is just so great celestial submarines, but
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.440]   summer begin by settling in summer. Finding a comfortable position.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:41.280]   Oh, calm calm slash Mac break. Now don't get excited. I know you're all relaxed.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.840]   But everybody's leaving industrial design.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:55.040]   I'm sorry I fell asleep. This is actually not everybody. There's 24 members of the team,
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.000]   but three designers recently left. What's what's interesting? I was reading this article at the
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.320]   Wall Street Journal is that Johnny I've has kind of come back. I mean, he seems like he's more
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:13.520]   involved in the past. So who's leaving and how important is this Renee? You're muted. You've got
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.160]   so calm. You fell on your mic. No, I apologize. It was the noise outside. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.920]   wouldn't have been conducive. The burn building would not have been conducive to calm.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:28.080]   It's it's so yes, there are absolutely people leaving, but there have been people who've been
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:34.000]   coming on over the last few years as well. And this reads to me more like a changing of the guard
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.400]   because that team has been almost completely static. There's been one or two people who've left
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.280]   over the last decades, not just the last few years or the last decades. And now they've got some
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.880]   young blood in that they're really excited about. And some of the people who've been there since
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.680]   like the original IMAX. The expression is horrible. I apologize for using it, but some people start
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.200]   to think about spending more time with their money. I mean, family. And once you put in an
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.600]   incredible amount of time and you've created all those products and you have a bunch of hot new
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.960]   young designers who you've brought in, you spend time teaching the culture and the job and everything
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.960]   too, that retirement looks really attractive or just the desire to do something else. Like,
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.640]   you know, maybe make belts or furniture or something and becomes incredibly compelling.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.600]   What a privilege to have worked there. It doesn't reflect on it in any way.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:32.400]   You know, people move on. One of the designers leaving is Rico Zorkendorfer.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.440]   He said he was taking a break from his professional life to spend time with his family. He felt
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.640]   privileged to work with his money. I mean, with his family. He felt privileged to work on Apple's
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.000]   design team. But he also said, and this is important, we have incredible new designers and new
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.040]   generation. What we've been able to do the last few decades will continue. The talent is there.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.760]   There is obviously a lot of continuity. I mean, this is just three out of 24 and Johnny Ives is
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:03.200]   still there. But I think you do need to get fresh blood, fresh eyes in a fairly regular basis.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.760]   Like, do the AR glasses have to look like Dider Rams? I mean, that's a question we need to start
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:15.280]   asking. Right. Yeah. I would love it if it's this kind of where fresh blood and fresh styling
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   came to Apple products. A friend of mine posted just just he got a new Mac mini and he put his
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.960]   like, cinema display on it and he had a clean desk to put it all over. And just showing off,
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:38.000]   hey, here's my setup now. And I couldn't get over that. This is just a flat gray photo. There's nothing,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.080]   no details, nothing to catches the eye, no lights, no anything. It was just gray rectilin,
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:55.280]   rectilinear boxes. And not that we should have banana shaped computers that have RGB LEDs. But
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:02.320]   like a MIT flea market last month, last week, three bucks, I had to buy the Apple personal
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:10.240]   model. Oh, look at that. Classic, classic frog design. And look at it's okay. I haven't
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:16.960]   cleaned it up yet. Well, there is a special so all of the app beige stuff like that gets yellowed.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:24.000]   But apparently there's a liquid. Is that how it is? It's peroxide and UV light.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.600]   But somebody made an actual product for cleaning the yellow off of beige Apple product. Someone
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.160]   after a lot of experimentation made the special product called the thing they call it retro bright.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.360]   And then some and then of course the internet being the internet try to figure out what's in
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.000]   the stuff. And they figured out if you just go to like a beauty supply store and get like a gallon
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.040]   jug of the stuff you bleach hair with, it will actually work just as well. Here's the page for
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:55.600]   DIY retro bright. Interesting. So I presume Andy, you're going to do all of this.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:01.840]   Of course, a restoration project. I've been watching too much bum gartner design. So I'm
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.440]   going to be testing different swabs on this. But what is getting retro bright contains 3%
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.680]   oxygen hydrogen peroxide. And then the rest is oxy clean. Good. Oh, I see clean.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:20.960]   But while I'm getting it is that like this is such an interesting object and all these and
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:26.400]   these lines are for heat venting. But doesn't it make it sort of interesting from various angles
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.720]   and you have this one piece of color in the Apple logo. It's just a very, very
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.480]   beautiful thing. And the thing is Apple products for everything that they're good at. And I know
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.120]   that they like clean lines and clean design that makes it helps make it timeless. But
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:48.160]   they're just the most boring objects to look at. They're just, I would love to see a new design
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.520]   team that says, you know what, we're going to have like one flash of color for just like you
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.200]   when you before you go out, you're supposed to look in the mirror and take off like all but one
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:02.640]   accessory. Like we're going to allow each of these devices to have one bit of flash, one accessory
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.840]   that makes it more endearing, that makes it more compelling. It's like these are, I would love to,
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:14.000]   I think that all design needs to go through revolutions and evolutions that a house style
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.760]   can only last you so long before it becomes predictable and boring and easy. I'm going to
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.080]   play what you're saying is you want to bring back the candy Mac.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:31.280]   If there were a flower power Mac out there, that I'm not saying I would buy it, but it would be
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.560]   on the last two that I would be choosing between. I'm going to point you to the eight bit guy on
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:43.040]   YouTube who did a complete restoration and did what you see all those chemicals in front of him.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:49.440]   I think he used it in his hair earlier because it seems to have disappeared. But he apparently,
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.840]   little later on in the video, you can see he experimented on an apple keyboard so you can see
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:01.120]   the effects of the different chemicals side by side on the keys. Let me see if I can find it.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.600]   Here it is. I love his videos. Yeah. Oh, you know the eight bit guy. Oh, yeah, I know the big
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.480]   fan. I thought you were the eight bit guy at first. But anyway, so there's at least 16 bits.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.880]   The equal key is the original, then he tried ozone, ozone plus UV 40 percent peroxide plus
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:23.360]   way too much heat, 160 degree heat engine cleaner, vinyl cleaner did a pretty good job.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.920]   Also took off the key cap. Yeah, but it took off the key cap. So yeah, this is interesting.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:34.080]   I think the latest the latest idea is not only the retro bright solution, but also put it in a
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:43.440]   sous vide so that it's a little bit warmer. So feed your modem. Well, you don't care if it stops
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:47.680]   working. That thing doesn't work. No, down and even if it did, who would use it? I'm not even
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.280]   sure how to test it. Like there are forks that you have to be really old school to know that
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:59.360]   that's Apple desktop. Yeah. Yeah. And you got your I don't even have like an actual phone plugged
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:05.200]   into my one phone jack that Verizon installed. But it does I recognize this thing that I recognize
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:11.520]   that the grounded outlet. But see, but also if I don't if it offends me, you can also just pull
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.720]   it right off. And now you can just have this thing that you can use as a retro pie case.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.880]   I think that's from the Bible. If I if I grounded outlet offends the pluck it out.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.960]   Right. I believe it's I believe that's from the Bible. Yeah. So they're designers leaving,
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:32.800]   but you know what that who knows this might be a whole new Apple. Look, it has to change from
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.520]   time to time. It has over time. Yeah. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But I
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.560]   am I was really glad to read in that journal article that Johnny returned to day to day
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.680]   operations about a year ago. Because yeah, it was good to have him back. Hey, here's some bad news.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:52.640]   And I found this out from a friend who's a photographer for years. He followed John Bonjovi around as his
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.520]   official concert photographer. Right now he's the official concert photographer for Luke Combs.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.360]   His name is David Bergman. And he came he came by the studio on Sunday. He does he has
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.680]   really does a really I really want to do this workshop. And you should do it too. Live concert
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.920]   photography workshops, you actually get to be in the pit of a Luke Combs concert. And he trains
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.280]   you on how you know how to get the best images. I need that too. Isn't that cool? Well, it's coming
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.080]   to Guilford, New Hampshire and June 15th if you want to know only five interesting only five people
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.560]   get to join him for that. Anyway, David, I has David because I always do when I see a pro and this guy
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:36.480]   is a prose pro really good photographer. What's your workflow? And he stunned me. He said aperture.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.360]   He said, I never stopped using it. He said, I don't use lightroom. I use aperture. I never stopped.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:49.440]   Well, bad news, David. Yeah. This is the last Mac OS version that will support aperture because I
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:56.080]   guess it's 32 bit. Is that why Renee? That might be why I actually didn't think about that. But it's
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.960]   Apple announced a while ago that it was going to be, you know, removing official support and then
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.080]   removing even accidental support. So it won't run. That's probably a big indicator. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:12.080]   You were on your own for a while. And now you're out. You're an announcement on an Apple support page.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.320]   And of course, on the support page, they do something that must kill Apple migrate your aperture
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:25.040]   libraries to photos or Adobe Lightroom. I don't think photos is a suitable replacement for our
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.680]   professional photographer Lightroom. Yeah, might be. Anyway, I've, yeah, that really was a shame
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.560]   because I think one of the great things about when Apple designs applications in house, they really
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.360]   do show off how great the Apple, the Mac user interface can be when you don't do because Lightroom,
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.840]   I've, I had a switch. I decided that I had to switch to it after Apple decided to just basically
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:55.440]   let aperture become a wild thing foraging out a garbage can and for itself. Is that you? I hope
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.040]   that's are they building the berms with hammer and saw? What is that? You Renee the hammering?
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.400]   Or is this somebody else? Yeah. No, no, I think it's probably my true.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.000]   And can catch their closing doors or sandbagging things or walking around the
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.760]   O is just. And it's moved to pedal. It's all right. No, no, no, we can deal with it. We can live with it.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:21.600]   But all I was saying is that what was aperture was wonderful. I loved it. I didn't, I had the
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.160]   opportunity to switch to Lightroom when it was when aperture was still a viable thing. But I
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   preferred aperture because it was such a Mac app. Whereas Adobe, they can't make a special version
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.880]   for the Mac and a special version with the Windows interface. So it's always going to be a little bit
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:45.760]   less than. So it makes me a little bit sad when Apple stops making it in house app because that's
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:52.800]   that's really how you show how good the ingredients of a Mac interface are. But the thing is we that
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:13:00.560]   they did that good for them. They didn't acts it before they had to exit. So at this point, if you
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:06.320]   didn't, if you haven't switched to Lightroom, if you haven't made an exit plan for aperture yet,
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:14.000]   you really have no one to blame. Why did Apple hire a professional philosopher?
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:21.440]   Turns out this is a story. Is that your philosophy question? Yes, it's a philosophical question. No
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.640]   need to answer. Joshua Cohen, who was used to teach political philosophy at Stanford,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.480]   has been employed as a philosopher at Apple, this an Apple distinguished senior fellow
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:39.760]   since 2011 works full time at Apple University, occasionally does outside talks. But most of the
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:46.960]   time his work is confidential and Apple even refuses permission for him to be interviewed.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:54.160]   Quartz attempted to interview him, says that Apple denied permission and concludes the company is
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.800]   against open discussion about philosophy. That's a ridiculous. We have some proprietary philosophies.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.280]   We just don't want to share with the rest of the world. That is wild. Former Yale Dean Joel
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.840]   Padoni is also there. What's not mentioned is that 99.9% of the people you're asked to interview
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.600]   at Apple will be done. Yeah, they don't want anybody to talk. Yeah. And I mean that that article
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:28.560]   goes on to say that he also goes around and does other speaking engagements. So I'm imagining that
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:34.240]   it's not Apple is saying that he can't talk to people about philosophy. It's that he can't talk
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:40.560]   to people about Apple. He also is editor of Boston Review, it has been since 1991. So he writes
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.640]   articles there. He's doing his own academic research. The real thing I wanted to know is,
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.600]   well, what is this Apple University and how can I go there? Yeah, right. It sounds fun.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.120]   It's been there for a while. Did he? Yeah. Yeah. He was an intern at Apple University.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.240]   It was basically their attempt to codify Apple culture post Steve Jobs so that Apple itself
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.000]   become a product. Brilliant. That's actually a brilliant idea. I think it also has its roots
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.760]   and Steve's return to Apple because when Steve ran next, he also had sort of an internal,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.040]   not as big as Apple University. But the idea of here is a place where we're going to create our
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.880]   own course for we're going to create our own study where as a matter of fact, one of the,
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:29.200]   I think the Dean, so to speak of that school was even one of the former flying caromots off
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:35.040]   brothers, believe it or not. But yeah, it's one of those things that- Juggling is-
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.400]   That's one of those things that- Juggling is a truth, I might point out.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.520]   Yeah. Very good. I think it's a Pixar University too.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:48.000]   Oh, really? Interesting. Right. Yeah. So, and I think that at Pixar University,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.840]   even if you're in the sanitation crew, if you want to learn art, if you want to learn how to
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.320]   rig lights, you can actually take classes and rig lights. They believe in whatever you're doing.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:07.280]   You can learn anything else just as a personal improvement sort of thing. I really wish we,
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.640]   at some point, Apple were to take the lid off of Apple University because a lot of corporations
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.200]   have something that's kind of like that. I'm not aware of something that's as comprehensive.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.800]   But it's not like they're- This isn't like we're sending you to management school to learn how
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.240]   our systems work. It really is like an MBA where you don't get a real MBA, so it's like the University
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:34.800]   of Phoenix in that regard. But we're going to teach you why Apple does it, things the way that they do.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.800]   And so, if you actually were to move to another company, you would be taking principles with you.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.160]   That's not about copying Apple's principles so much as learning how to be a good manager,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.760]   how to be an engineer, how to- And I'm sure the philosophy is part of it because, again,
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.880]   that's signpost the intersection between liberal arts and engineering.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.720]   Philosophy. If nothing else, it's good to have something so that if you are a kid majoring
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.600]   philosophy, you can tell your parents, you see, Apple hiring philosophers? It's not the most-
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.200]   At least it's probably the- This is not a communications degree.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.360]   It's probably the case studies that didn't turn out so well for Apple and the lessons learned
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.800]   that they're not so interested in seeing class. I mean, few companies have their own university,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.880]   but a lot of companies, when I worked for Ziff Davis, they would pay for continuing education.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.560]   With the one stipulation, it can't be in anything you're doing at Ziff Davis.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.200]   The theory being, we don't want you to get better at what you do now. We want you to get new skills
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   you could bring back. I think that's not unusual. I think that's good.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:41.680]   We don't see that coming- You already went to Harvard. You don't need any more education.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:46.640]   You need less education. You have less learning about bolo ties.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.480]   Get let them in. Learn about bolo ties.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.240]   They give you access to the internet and a lack of supervision. You can learn about whatever you
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.400]   want from the crew. It's really true. I am. We're going to be in Athens in the fall,
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.640]   and there's an online course, Yale course in Greek history and philosophy that's free.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:11.760]   I'm going to take the course so that I'm prepared. We're going to spend a few days in Athens,
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.800]   and I want to be ready to understand what I'm seeing. I just think that that's just so
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:24.640]   exciting, so cool. Let's see. Power beats. Are you going to buy some Renee?
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.560]   Yes, but I'm not a big audio file. That's all Lori Gill.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.520]   We're going to do it. Lori to do it.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.160]   We own that.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:32.640]   Yes.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.360]   So hard. I'm so excited about it. I think I've mentioned this before that the
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.920]   AirPods are not very comfortable to me to wear. They hurt, but I love the convenience of them.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.640]   So I am so excited about Power Beat's pro coming out with the H1 chip. So it's going to give me all
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:53.600]   the things that I love about AirPods, but it's going to be hopefully less painful, a little more
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.360]   comfortable. All the things you love about AirPods for $100 more.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.480]   Yep. And less painful.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.040]   Pre-orders start on May 3rd. That's why I'm bringing it up. You can actually now buy them.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.040]   And you'll get yours May 10th. So I expect Lori to tell us all about them following Mac
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.840]   Break Weekly. I will probably be wearing them for our next meeting.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.200]   Nice. Yeah. I think we talked about this last week. They're going to be more of that
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.120]   Beats profile of sound though. Bass-heavy sound, we think.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.720]   Right. Right. Yeah. All right. I'm not going to run out and get them.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:34.000]   Nope. I'm going to let Megan get them. Megan's going to get them and review them for us.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.680]   Because I don't, I like a flatter sound myself.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:43.280]   Let's see. According to Ming Chi Quo, there'll be two new AirPods models
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:48.560]   in the fourth quarter. Ming has been a little off lately.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.440]   So I'm not sure I'm going to believe. I think he's still confusing this.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.320]   So yeah, I think this is not, it's not that it's not being reported well,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.040]   but I think that there's a lot lost in the translation.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.360]   That what he's talking about is sort of like the, I'm not going to call them ProPods just because
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.600]   I don't want that branding to go everywhere. But there'll be like a slightly higher end AirPods
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:15.200]   where people are willing to pay more for noise cancellation, waterproofing, a few of those features.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.360]   And hopefully as those become the premium, the current AirPods will go down in price.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:25.120]   Like the iPad Pro versus the 9.7 inch iPad. But I think the second one is probably those over
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.480]   the ear versions that we've heard about previously, which would be an entirely different form factor.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.920]   And then you can see Apple starting to build out its like wearable product line.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.200]   Hmm, interesting. All right.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.800]   We're going to have to review those too.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.840]   Yeah, sorry Lori.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.560]   Yes, so many head bumps. I'm down though. I can't wait.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.040]   We got to hurry up because what about 20 minutes from now?
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.280]   Apple's going to send out its press release. The quarterly earnings.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:56.720]   I like to ask this. We won't know what they, we won't be able to talk to them to next week.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:02.080]   We'll talk about them till next week. But I'd love to hear your thoughts about what we'll be looking
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:07.440]   for. This is what the second quarter, the first quarter is the big quarter for Apple.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.920]   So this is not a big quarter. What do you think Renee?
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.040]   It's not traditionally a big quarter. We're going to hear about iPhone numbers
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:21.040]   because iPhone is such a big business. And like we saw with Google and Samsung earlier this quarter,
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.840]   it's not a big growth business right now. So it's going to be a lot of drama surrounding the
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:31.680]   iPhone numbers. We'll also should hear about the services, which again, I like that Benedict
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:37.920]   Evans sort of take on this where Apple's pivoting from, it just works to you can just trust us.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:42.080]   And they're starting to build out instead of the digital hub, sort of like the services hub,
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:46.880]   where you can get a lot of your stuff inside Apple with tools that are simple and easy to manage and
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.480]   add to and remove from and all of those things. And then I think we'll maybe hear, we heard rumors
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.400]   about WWE Sierra ready, but we might hear Tim throw out some words about autonomy and augmented
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:05.920]   reality just to sort of throw red meat at the salivating lions that are on the call. So he has
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:10.720]   something to chomp down on that's not him and Luca. I'm looking at Neil Seibart. He writes the
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.240]   above Avalon blog, his predictions. And I see a lot of negative
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.440]   science in the year over year growth for revenue growth. Now again, this is a prediction, not the
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:25.360]   actual numbers. He does seem a big, see a big growth though in the wearables segment in iPad
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.960]   revenue. If you look at it from Silicon from Qualcomm from out there, like there's just,
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:36.000]   there's no one selling, no one producing selling or making wearables anywhere to the quantity that
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.440]   Apple is. And that's going to be a huge growth factor in real like near future really personal
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:50.640]   computing. Yeah. Also services, we'll expect to see growth there. It's just the old iPhone that's
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:58.880]   not going to be such a big grow. As usual, I'm looking forward to analysts questions that come
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:07.680]   afterward. That's why because this is the one place where the CEO of the company can get
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.520]   questions that they're really not prepared for beforehand. And whatever they say will create legal
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.680]   responsibilities if they lie or misdirect in any way, shape or form. So it's always,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.320]   that's why these kind of earnings calls are always really, really interesting.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.720]   Well, nothing more to say except stay tuned. Go to imore.com in about half an hour.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.200]   The transcripts you'll have to read every. Oh, I guess who's doing the transcripts.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:43.280]   Take it over. Oh, Michael Sergeant. All right. Even better. Yes. He's my, my shining star in the
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:48.560]   dark night because he always does them for us. And I'm so grateful to him. He could type really
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:55.760]   fast. He has, he has, he has, he's typing is so stylish. We tried to do transcripts for Elon Musk
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:02.960]   once. It is so much harder than Tim Cook. Really? Tim is very leisurely. But he speaks also so
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.640]   cleanly. It is not like, it makes you really appreciate Tim Cook after you've got his EOs.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:16.160]   So, well, all three, if you'd be listening, Laurie and Renee and Micah. Okay. And Andy too.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.960]   Of course. Awesome. We'll look for your reports.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.520]   And it may even, sometimes it happens a little before we end up winding up the show. But we're
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.760]   going to do such an interesting game because they know Apple won't answer direct questions. So,
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.760]   they try to ask the question they want and it's obtuse away as pot. Like, can I have some colors
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.280]   surrounding the, what your thoughts about? And it's like this cat in mouse game because Tim knows
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.160]   what they're doing. It's just fascinating. It's like, it's like game of not thrones, but game of
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:52.960]   police throw me a bone. It's very, very. There's also that moment where somebody asks a question that
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.640]   gets them to kind of like, oh, you know, we can, we can drop this little thing that's really
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.480]   gonna excite them. But we're not really saying anything. But I want to say something about it
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:07.280]   so bad. So, I'm gonna just drop this little bit of a tidbit. Like, that's the stuff I'm like
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.400]   grabbing onto when I listen to these things. Like, oh, I think I understand what he was talking about
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.400]   just now. I get where he says he says this is Tim, even though the only other person on the call
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.640]   has a really heavy Italian accent and he has a really good southern accent. But every time,
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:29.840]   this is Tim. The most fun part is when it's kind of like a game of password, where there's the
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.840]   phrase that you're not allowed to say in either of one of you, like that you can't say release date
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:42.960]   for the self-driving car. However, they're willing to give you answers so long as they don't have to
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:48.720]   say that phrase. So, there are times where, like I'm interviewing or having a conversation with
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.240]   or I'm gonna call with one of these people. And so long as I phrase this in terms of, I can't ask
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:59.440]   what, when are you gonna be adding plug and extensibility to this product? But I can say,
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.000]   how is this key? Give me an idea of how well this is architected. For instance, there's a lot
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.400]   of future technology that this platform should be prepared for that I'm not seeing in the original
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:19.360]   specs of the product that allows them to say that yes, we got plug and support, but I can't say
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:26.560]   that we've got plug and support. It's hysterically funny. We're very bullish on the future of self-driving
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.960]   cars. Do you think they want they actually like Tim kind of wants to say stuff?
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:36.480]   Yeah, I think so. So in some circumstances, I bet they're just bursting at the scene of wishing
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.160]   they could tell people like the most awesome thing there to it. They go home and do it. They go home,
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.880]   have a little drink and say, this is what I wanted to say. Yeah, they sit in front of a camera that's
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:50.560]   not turned on and say all of those things. Do they not do so out of prudence or because of regulations?
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:58.160]   Absolutely. Just to keep their company from, in an earnings call, if they're going to start saying
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:05.440]   something. Look what happens when Apple announced the airpower, the hubbub around the fact that
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.800]   they announced something that they never put out. If they're just constantly saying, yeah, we're
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:15.200]   making a self-driving car in the future. If they just straight out say that, that's just a mess.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.880]   Nobody want to be Elon Musk in a call. Just saying stuff and getting fines and going crazy.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:30.400]   How how how deep in do you have to get for the government to assign rules to how you can use
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.200]   Twitter? That's like that's like that's like what a 14 year old has to deal with with their mom
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.000]   or their dad saying, I'm going to I'm going to change the password to your Twitter every single
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.880]   week. And if you want to tweet something, you have to come to me. But that's like Elon then saying,
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.720]   but dad, your tweets are cray cray. And dad said, well, I'm the dad or president or whatever.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:56.000]   Oh, come on. You didn't know that I was joking when I the CEO of a tech company
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.200]   talked about having an IPO and what the stock price would be. Clearly I was. I see I had the
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.800]   the colon and 20 should have been given away. Yeah. All right, let's take a break. Get your
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:12.400]   picks ready, folks. But first I'm going to show you my pick. That's this. No, not the iPad mini,
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:19.680]   although we are running it on an iPad mini. It's envoy, which is the way to modern way to welcome
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.600]   guests to your business. When you come to Twitter, you guys know this in the past, there's been a
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:33.120]   long multi page document that you've had to read and sign before we'd allow you in. Now you just get
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.840]   to the envoy app, you tap to sign in and enter your name. We show you what you need to know,
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:45.920]   you sign and you're done. Envoy is the modern way to welcome guests and still preserve your
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.680]   security. You feel welcoming, but you're also protecting yourself. It's an iPad kiosk that makes
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.800]   workplaces more efficient. When visitors arrive, they sign in an iPad kiosk. They enter their
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:03.040]   details. They sign any legal documents. In our case, it's a waiver and many Silicon Valley companies,
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.480]   because they all use it. It's an NDA and they sign it right on the iPad. Envoy, then,
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.360]   though, goes does a lot more. They notify, for instance, the host, whoever the guest is there to
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.560]   visit. They'll automatically alert the employee when the guest arrives using whatever you use,
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.920]   Slack or chatter or whatever it is you use, saving your time in hassle. Your employee knows who's
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:31.600]   coming, knows when, no more. Oh, come on. You're in the lobby. I'll be right there. No awkward meetings.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:38.160]   And by the way, when a VIP comes in, you can mark those names VIP and you make sure they get
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.400]   great treatment. There's another Envoy app we use all the time, which is Envoy Deliveries, which
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:48.480]   keeps our delivery guy uses. And we use to notify people your packages at the desk. It's a great
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.680]   way to keep from losing packages. You'll boost your office efficiency with smart security that
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:59.360]   doesn't scare people. It doesn't seem unwelcoming. It just seems friendly. No more paper log book,
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:04.160]   which really is kind of useless. Anyway, sign an unlimited visit. Yes, you can connect it to a
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:09.680]   printed print customized badges. You could send alerts when VIPs arrive. You could notify administrators
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:15.680]   about unattended guests. Integrates completely with existing security systems. So, for instance,
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:21.360]   you could give people Wi-Fi access. You could say, oh, here's our password. It could do ID checks,
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.480]   emergency notifications. And you'll have data on everybody who's come to the office. So you know
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.400]   who's coming when they're on site, who they're meeting, and why. And we're a tiny little business.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:37.840]   So it's not as critical for us, but imagine a Silicon Valley business with multiple buildings,
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:44.000]   multiple visitors, 10,000 workplaces worldwide choose Envoy, not only because it makes a great
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.200]   first impression, but because it preserves your security. Nike uses a Pinterest Spotify,
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:57.280]   30 million visitors welcomed to date. It works with G Suite and Box as well that design and meet
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:03.360]   your needs at even compliance requirements and security requirements. It doesn't matter what kind
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.880]   of business you're in, even highly regulated industries. Envoy works. Protect your people,
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:15.600]   protect your property, protect your ideas. The welcoming way with Envoy, E-N-V-O-Y. Go to
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:23.200]   Envoy.com/twit. Start your free trial today, Envoy, E-N-V-O-Y.com/twit. We thank him for
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.440]   a supporting Mac Break Weekly. I mean, thank you for supporting us by using that URL,
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:33.600]   Envoy.com/twit. Mr. Nokosa, your pick of the week.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:40.000]   My pick is something awesome that I came across on Reddit, a user by the name of every view.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.080]   3D printed a case for his Apple Watch that turns it into an iPhone Nano.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.040]   Oh my. If you can believe it.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:56.000]   You take the watch off of its band, you snap it in the middle, and then you snap your AirPods,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.200]   one above it, one below it. So the one is acting as in your piece, the other as
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:06.160]   a microphone. So if you have the cellular version of the Apple Watch,
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:11.840]   you'll be able to take and receive phone calls, you'll be able to get text messages.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.280]   And he thoughtfully uploaded the 3D file so you can print one off for yourself.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:23.600]   But I'm hoping that someone will either license, ideally license this idea from him or rip him off,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:29.200]   because the number of times you've been at a wedding or some sort of function where you know
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.720]   that if you have a phone in your pocket, you're going to wind up spending time on the phone because
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:41.040]   family weddings are super boring. But this will give you like everything that you need a phone for
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:48.240]   while having something that's about the size of a credit card. Or if you are one of these people
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:54.800]   who, part of the culture that does not have, society does not give you clothing with pockets,
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:59.120]   that this will be something you can actually put in your pocket.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:06.240]   It just looks, it's such a cool idea and such a lateral idea that I kind of want to send them
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.360]   like a hundred dollar Dunkin Donuts gift card or something for this because it just looks like
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:19.200]   such a neat idea. Well, speaking of cool and neat ideas, Alex Gumpel's pick for you, Andy,
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:26.640]   is Helmert Esslinger's book about frog design. Keep it simple, the early design years of Apple,
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.360]   in which it has a lot of illustrations of exactly the kinds of things that you were showing
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.240]   and you picked up at the flea market. And what I really love about this, thank you Alex Gumpel
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:41.840]   for bringing it in, is you see the genesis of the ideas. So you can see the original sketches,
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.920]   you can see their thoughts, designs that didn't make the drawing board, make it off the drawing
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.440]   boarding. And I think your modem's in here somewhere. So this is a really beautiful book.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:57.920]   Alex Gumpel, which is weird, is our Windows expert. But for some reason,
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:04.320]   collection of image Mac stuff. I just don't get it. Keep it simple. It's available still on
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:10.000]   Amazon in paperback as well. Well, again, you've been around for a while,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.080]   which would you rather have a gateway PC or a frog design Apple II CI? Oh, absolutely.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:20.480]   The frog design stuff was so gorgeous. And the funny thing is Acer and a number of other
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.120]   companies said, Oh, how come apples got so much better looking stuff? Let's try to make a good
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.920]   looking PC. And man, they made the worst looking stuff. Oh my God, it was horrible.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.480]   Lori Gill, your pick of the week. What do I have to buy this week?
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.000]   So actually, I think you have to hook this week. I am channeling my Jim Dalrymple here. Last
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.360]   night I was sitting in the backyard having a beer and I decided to check out what Apple Music
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:55.200]   had on and classic metal playlists popped up for me. Here's the thing. And no slight on the people
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.160]   that curate these playlists because they work hard and they probably have a pretty large mandate.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:07.600]   But usually when it comes to niche stuff, they're terrible. And when it comes to my particular
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.280]   preferences in metal, I've been disappointed every time. But I popped this one up and I thought,
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:21.840]   I'll give it a try. And I would say 90% of what's on this list fits what I think is considered to
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.680]   be classic metal. There's a few stinkers in there. There's a few in there that I'm not sure why they
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.600]   would put that on the classic metal list. But overall, you get the idea they're pulling from
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.680]   what you would consider maybe the new version of a particular type of metal. Like for example,
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:46.160]   there's DRI in there, which they were hardcore punk that switched over to metal. And so they're
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:52.560]   kind of like the progenitors of that particular type of metal. You have Slayer who were kind of
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:59.280]   the beginnings of thrash metal. So it's not classic metal in the way that it's only like the classic
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.960]   rock that kind of transitioned to metal. It's sort of broader stroking in that. But I thought they
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.800]   did a pretty good job with this. So if you like metal music, especially if you like early metal,
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:15.440]   if you like, you know, like Sabbath and stuff like that, this is a pretty darn good playlist. I think
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.640]   you'd be happy with it. Again, a couple of stinkers, but really considering how difficult it must have
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.920]   been to build a playlist this long, I think they did a good job. It is long. It ends with
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:33.120]   Ina Gaudet of Vida, which cracks me up begins with Metallica one and ends with Ina Gaudet of Vida.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:41.040]   I thought, you know, I would guess that this is because there's one person in the music department
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:47.520]   that loves this genre. Right. And so this one person put it together. I think so. And again,
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.120]   it's only because I've tried a lot of the metal playlist that Apple puts out and I just go,
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:58.800]   what? What? What are you thinking? And this one really seems like it came from somebody
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.840]   who listens to metal all the time and really kind of understands it. So I was really happy with
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.320]   them. Kudos to the person that created the classic metal playlist for Apple music.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.600]   Very nice. Good recommendation. If you're new to metal, here's everything you need.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.360]   Yeah, it's a good starting play. If you want to bother mom, play it real loud. Renee Richie,
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.360]   pick of the week. So I think there's a variety of these apps. So I just linked to the developer's
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:31.440]   homepage. It's Aaron Pierce and he makes a bunch of really cool home kit apps. So the one that was
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:37.200]   just updated today is called Home Run. And that lets you set up a bunch of different easy to
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.600]   access scenes right on your watch. So you can look up, hit the complication, hit the scene that you
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.720]   want. And it makes it super easy to manage. He has Home Cam, which will take multiple camera
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:50.960]   sources and put them all on one screen for you for you. So you can sort of get a whole glance at
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:56.000]   your home or your office or your building. He has one that just lets you store your home kit codes
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.240]   because sometimes it's on the peripheral. Is it on the box? I don't remember where it is.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.000]   And then you're trying to re-register it. And it's just a nightmare. So he lets you store it.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.160]   And he also has home kit. Sorry, there's a fourth one, the scanner. That's right, the Bluetooth scanner.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:16.800]   That lets you sort of try and diagnose problems because if you don't have a HomePod or an Apple TV,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.160]   which acts like a range extender and retransmitter, you might have issues if the wall is blocking it
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.000]   or if it's out of range or something like that. And they can save you a lot of headaches trying
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:32.080]   to figure out exactly what's going on there. So he didn't make one ginormous home app thing
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:37.120]   that you have to go and get and install everywhere. Instead, he made very specific, almost surgical
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:43.680]   tools for very specific home kit tasks. And they work really, really well. He spends a lot of time
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.240]   and effort trying to get them to the point where they just do exactly what you want them to do.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.880]   And if you're all in on HomeKit like I am, or even if you just have a couple things and
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:56.000]   you're interested in it, they help make the experience just that much better.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:04.800]   Thank you, my friends. Another Mac breaky episode coming to a close. Lori Gill has to go
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:12.320]   do a lot of listening to Tim and Cook. She's a managing editor at iMore at Apoholic on the Twitter
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   APPA HOLIK. And of course, sick, sick band, sick, sick burn. I know there was a sick in there.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:29.920]   You're a Californian. You know, sick burn, man. Is her band catcher wherever you can. Now with
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:37.760]   pink hair, I like it. I like it. Renee Richie also at iMore where he leads the vector podcast,
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.480]   among other things, imore.com/vector. He'll be busy, busy, busy in about five minutes.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:49.360]   I'm going to let you go early here. And this is Tim. Yeah, this is Tim. Go roll tide.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:56.160]   Good morning. He's war Eagle. Yeah, I like that. Good morning.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.760]   Annie and I go, you'll hear him on Chicago on Boston public radio. When?
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:11.040]   Next up is I think Monday of next week. All right. WGBH in Boston. Of course, you'll catch all three
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:18.400]   every Tuesday for Mac break. Weekly ran about 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC. You
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:24.640]   could tune in and watch or listen live at twit.tv/live. If you do that, get in the chat room. I
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:30.400]   are seed.twit.tv. That's all the cool kids are hanging out while they listen live. You can also
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:35.920]   listen on demand because it is that thing we call a podcast on demand versions of our shows.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:42.960]   All of them available at twit.tv, both audio and video, twit.tv/mbw if you want to go right to the

[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.680]   of choice is, you can always find Mac break weekly. And if you subscribe, then you don't have to

[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.440]   Thanks for watching and listening everybody. We appreciate it. But now I'm sad to say it's time
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.600]   to get back to work because, in the words of Alex Lindsey, break time is over.
