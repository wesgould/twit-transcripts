[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Andy Renee, Lori and Alex are all here.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   We got lots to talk about. The GIF versus GIF battle takes a weird turn.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.000]   Apple's saying we're not going to accept long-term HTTP certificates anymore.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   And we'll talk a lot about the ARM Macs that Ningji Kuo says will be coming next year.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest happenings.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.720]   With Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore and the fabulous vector show.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.640]   Renee, what happened to your beautiful lighting?
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.240]   Are you just normally lit now?
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   No, I had to move stuff because I'm having repair work done,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.720]   so the normal light is too far away.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   And so I opened up the daylight because it not always looks so much better than I do.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.480]   It is daylight.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.880]   And I'm busy.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.440]   There's actual daylight in here.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.720]   I'm not used to seeing it, so it's very bright and I have to shield my eyes.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.960]   The sun is bouncing off the snow, I think.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.760]   It's very bright.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.440]   You know, people do make fun of that.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.520]   They're like, "Why do you complain about the sun?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.080]   You're in winter."
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.680]   And they don't realize that the snow and ice is a giant reflector.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.240]   And it's like just beaming up into your eyes all day.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.840]   And it's bright, white.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.800]   It's so bright.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.080]   Well, thank you for braving Snow blindness to join us on the show today.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680]   Andy and I also hear from Boston Public Radio.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.640]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.440]   Hello, and Renee's lighting is so bad.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.320]   You couldn't even see him blush when he lied, lied, lied about his.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.080]   Him usually looking better than me.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.360]   That's how bad is less than that.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:50.160]   And from the fabulous I'm more managing editor, Lori Gill, who was on Twitter on Sunday,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.440]   and it was great having you.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.040]   Thank you.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.720]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.600]   It was really great.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.960]   Yeah, nice to have you.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.520]   It was nice for me to do something like that on a Sunday afternoon too.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.320]   It came with something to do.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.040]   Also, your name came up on iOS today earlier.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.520]   Oh, really?
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.880]   Because, well, I had to show everybody my blanket with all the Susan Kerr icons
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.920]   that you recommended.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.200]   Will someone get Mr. LaPorte his chamomile tea?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.840]   It's actually quite cozy.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.400]   It's cool.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.960]   This is cool.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   I'm a little disappointed that after all these years, I haven't taught Micah the correct
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.080]   pronunciation is if the G is silent.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.800]   Just if.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.600]   This is a Cairo throw from Areaware if you want to get one.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.080]   And the woven blanket designed by Susan Kerr, pioneer of the original
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   Mac and Cops.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.080]   It feels great, doesn't it?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.640]   Well, yeah, I like cotton blankets.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.600]   I have quite a few of them.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.640]   But this really does look like I'm ready.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.760]   Ready for my tea.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.520]   It looks like James Brown.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.000]   James Brown.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.080]   James Brown for Matt Locke today.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.960]   I can't go on.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.400]   Also, Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.280]   He is of 090 Media, 090.media at Alex Lindsay on Twitter.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.640]   And has brought a special toy, which you will demonstrate at the end of the show.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.760]   Yes.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.200]   And drinking.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.880]   So they're really.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.760]   Been at the artist player.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   We were talking.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.960]   Giff, gif, gif.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.760]   Is going to get some peanut butter in the man.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.200]   You actually got some?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.480]   We got some peanut butter.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.600]   He's been all over Twitter.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.640]   Everybody's seen it by now.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.120]   But I actually, the company that makes Giff, JIF, peanut butter,
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.240]   actually spent, this is brilliant marketing.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.440]   You can see it includes not only the peanut butter, but a special spoon.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.320]   Peanut butter spoon.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.960]   Because that is actually how you're supposed to eat peanut butter.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   On the one side, they're normal label, JIF creamy peanut butter.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.440]   Soft, cheap pronunciation.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.640]   On the far side.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.960]   Giff, animated looping images, hard G pronunciation.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.000]   And the Giffy branding.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.120]   Those are the lee bread.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.920]   Isn't this hysterical?
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.880]   Isn't this hysterical jar?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.440]   Yes.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   More than two pounds of peanut butter.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.520]   And on the top, it says, if you've ever called a Giff a GIF, we forgive you.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.960]   Now, obviously they don't care.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.160]   Okay.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.720]   I do.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.480]   I have to wonder, what puts the bug up their nose to like, like 18 years after this
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.080]   became this was a thing to suddenly pull the trigger on this idea.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.200]   Because they finally hired someone that was less than 50.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.000]   A millennial.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.800]   You nailed it.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   They got a millennial in the marketing environment.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.280]   Is it also amazing that after all these years, we haven't replaced animated
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.880]   GIF GIFs with anything better?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   Millennials are losing.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.320]   You can do an animated ping.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.440]   Yeah, it's just it works.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.320]   But the one uses them.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.960]   And GIF GIFs are still the cliche.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.560]   People fire them off immediately.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.120]   They're in Slack.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.080]   They're in messages.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.720]   They're on Twitter.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.280]   They're everywhere.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.520]   I know.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.080]   It's too bad.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.800]   They're amazing.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.080]   It's a terrible format.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.360]   It's a terrible format, but it's really fun.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.760]   It is.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.440]   It's encumbered for a long time.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.160]   There was this issue because it was created for CompuServe.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.280]   CompuServe, yeah.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.440]   But somebody else had the patent to the way the compression algorithm worked.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.760]   So it was it was encumbered by this patent.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.520]   And then I think there was a lawsuit.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.960]   I think that's been resolved.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.720]   Well, patent only lasts a certain.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.520]   Yeah, but it doesn't.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yes.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.040]   This is an ancient format.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.440]   Like, does it?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.840]   You know, too.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.800]   Yes.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.160]   It doesn't actually compress very well.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.520]   No.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   It's not a good format nowadays, but doesn't really matter.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.680]   It's not.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   It's not.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.160]   It's not.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.480]   Plus isn't it only 256 colors?
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.280]   I think it is.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:31.280]   But I think part of the the the the the the beauty of it is that it's rough and is just short and it
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.240]   doesn't have any audio.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.600]   It's in it.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.800]   It's not a problem.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.000]   Well, no, it's it's it's a pre it's a pre-tiform it because it works.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.440]   That's we forget that it's nice to have things that are that like our high tech and our high compression and have all the based on the based on the latest research and the latest algorithms and papers.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.640]   But all we needed was we need we think was it would be funny, particularly in social media,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.400]   to be able to respond to something by having that clip from return to the Jedi of Han Solo going.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.200]   And it's a perfect format for that.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.680]   Everything supports it as well understood.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.360]   All you have to the built-in media players of every operating system supports it.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.480]   No, no, no, no. Every operating system supports Ping.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.600]   Ping is is Ping everything supports animated pings.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   They're 24 bit, not 8 bit.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.520]   Except the line field. They have 8-bit transparency.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.800]   So do we need it?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.680]   And how are you going to talk?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.240]   That's right.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.080]   This is made it was better than VHS.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.000]   I also I think I can't remember who what an actual like legitimate newspaper wrote about how
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.600]   the that GIF as GIF has come into its own as coming to
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.960]   recertancy because it is kind of the perfect format for like naughty video clips that,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.000]   you know, if like for the for the opening of Baywatch, you know, you just want to see like the
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.440]   clip of like the handsome buff men and women just like running in slow motion.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.200]   You don't want to have to say it Andy.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.680]   Yep.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.960]   There's no shame in Hasselhoff text.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.000]   Oh, well, I don't I have to I don't know if his pecs have been recertified for for social media yet.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.600]   backwards compatibility with non animated pings simple to the code the default image.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.200]   There tend to be smaller much smaller than gifts, but there are some.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   Yeah, full color spaces 24 bit.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.440]   I don't know. I can't I think I rather than this campaign gift versus GIF,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.200]   which benefits only peanut butter.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.880]   Why don't we have a campaign to get rid of animated gifts?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.560]   That's it.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.720]   I would argue that the young people aren't using them as much as kind of it's kind of
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.440]   I don't think they know.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.560]   They get outdated.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.160]   They're using they're creating their own memes now and gifts aren't quite as
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.760]   their gifts or ifs are quite as important as they used to be.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.200]   So you might get your wish.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.080]   I think that they don't even know that they are gifts.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.440]   True.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.920]   Right.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.120]   I don't think they like they're just the images that you insert into Facebook or
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.760]   they're the images that you insert into messenger or whatever they don't.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   They don't know that it is a thing.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.840]   What format it is doesn't really matter anymore.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.640]   It's just a it's a link to a thing that does the thing.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.560]   All right.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.000]   Let's talk about Apple.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.760]   He's in a bad mood now.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.480]   No.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.280]   Can we put?
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.880]   Can we put peanut butter in Apple?
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.040]   I have to say this peanut butter in Apple.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.560]   Hey, but they sent you a piece of they sent you some peanut butter and we talked about it for
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.760]   like 10 minutes.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.880]   Like that is amazing.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.520]   Mark it.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.840]   Or this is the second show we've talked about.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.520]   See that's what I'm saying.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.480]   More than their model.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.720]   The pixel for in those dominoes pizza box to Leo.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.680]   Were you in on that one?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.600]   Whatever they're paying that marketing guy.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.160]   Not enough.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.720]   Not enough.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.120]   Not enough.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.360]   Alex, so should we counterbalance this by
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.800]   quoting the USDA regulations on exactly how many insect eggs and full insects can be in a
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.080]   pound of peanut butter before the government says you can't sell it.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.320]   Come on.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.600]   You're not a peanut butter hater.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.240]   Are you?
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.800]   No, no, no.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.080]   I love peanut butter and I've.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.680]   Well, let's not think about what else is.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.840]   I'm telling you because that's extra protein.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.240]   Because bug like butter just doesn't have the same cash.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.480]   I prefer locally made organic peanut butter.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.520]   My sister's.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.480]   I just make my own now.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.040]   This actually is horrible peanut butter because it's got.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.160]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.920]   I got sugar in your head sugar.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.840]   They have hydrogenated vegetable.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.800]   It's peanut butter.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.480]   One has a short,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.800]   ingredient list peanuts and salt.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.120]   Would you read you probably better I say it than I do.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.400]   Are there any peanuts in there?
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.280]   There are some peanuts.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.920]   I think it's the number one.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.560]   I just want to point out that total sugars is the only thing that doesn't have a percentage
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.600]   of your daily amount.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.200]   You know, they do that.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.800]   There's no reason to add sugar to your.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.200]   Really?
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.880]   They don't put total sugar.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.040]   They don't put the percentage in there because they don't want you to think about it.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   Right.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.880]   Read the ingredient list.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.520]   It's the blue.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.560]   I don't know if you can read that.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.040]   You have to.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.680]   I can't read it.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.040]   I'd have to take out my context.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.400]   You need some of the stigmatism like me.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.280]   I'll take off my glass.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.520]   It should just be peanuts and salt.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.640]   That's a blue.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.520]   That's kind of peanut butter.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.480]   It's blue on red.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.960]   I can't read that.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.360]   Yeah, it's free.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480]   Well, I'm not opening this.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.040]   Are you kidding?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.200]   In 20 years, this is going to be.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.320]   This is my retirement.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.840]   No, Leo, you need two weeks.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.200]   But the question is stockpile.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.800]   Is there that in the Twitter college?
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.800]   Is there a GIF of that GIF?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.760]   That's the question I have.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   That's going to be your, that's going to be your, your beer flute.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.640]   The holdover.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.680]   So this media team has made gifts of that GIF.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.440]   That's going to be the challenge, isn't it?
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.040]   Because as we, as we now, the CDC is now saying, you know what?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.480]   It's going to be a pandemic.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.960]   And they're warning people to have two weeks worth of food,
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.840]   as you mentioned, Renee.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   Because you won't want to, not because the grocery store will be,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   you just won't want to go because you'll be.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.040]   So that'll be the challenge.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.640]   Do I eat this or do I get COVID?
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.960]   I don't like, all I can say is all the Mormons are going.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.680]   I told you.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.480]   I told you.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.280]   We don't even have to go.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.560]   We don't even have to go shopping.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.760]   Like we got it all.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.960]   We got it all set up already.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.400]   The day has finally come.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.040]   They are right.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.800]   I've had for a long time a 20 pound bag of corn.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.720]   I've just been, I'm ready.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.920]   I'm ready.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.360]   There it is.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.800]   That's the ingredients.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   How's your pantry moth situation?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.400]   If you've got a bag of corn.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.040]   It's dried.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.000]   They can't eat it.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.800]   Oh, by the way,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.440]   I want to write it.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.680]   Gif peanut butter contains peanuts.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.400]   So be careful.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.440]   Wow.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.400]   It is gluten free.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.240]   All right.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.680]   So there's two ingredients.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.040]   Like if it didn't say allages.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.000]   Because peanuts and sugar.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.880]   No, by the way, this is Lisa's chosen peanut butter.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.560]   So I can't take this home because she'll eat it.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.800]   She loves Gif.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.680]   It's her dessert.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.160]   It's better vegetable oil.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.360]   Yeah, that's why it doesn't separate.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.320]   Because it's hydrology.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.680]   And diaglycerides.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.080]   Mmm.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.640]   And no triglycerides.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.800]   Everybody wants all natural ingredients,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.120]   no preservatives until the third day
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.640]   after they get that loaf of bread home.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.840]   And it's all covered with mold.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.280]   I love this.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.640]   The sugar contains 2% or less of molasses.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.240]   Just in case you were worried
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.680]   that your white sugar might in any way be contaminated.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.880]   My molasses.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.680]   All right.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.320]   Enough.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.640]   Stop.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   Stop the peanut madness.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.080]   Insect larvae.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.360]   Let's get our legs.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.840]   Let's get our Cofevi 19 update.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.720]   Apple is moving some AirPod iPad
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.680]   and Apple Watch production from China to Taiwan.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.400]   I don't think you can stay ahead of a pandemic.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.280]   I don't think you can just move it and then,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.360]   oh, it'll all be fine here in Taiwan.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:17.840]   I don't.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.480]   I don't think they may be able to get a little
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.600]   ahead of it, get a couple more out.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.000]   I mean, for Apple, the timing actually is relatively,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.560]   it has a lot less impact than it would
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.320]   if it happened in September, right?
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.160]   And so, or August or the fourth.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.120]   Yeah, for the fourth.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.920]   We're in the slowest production time for Apple.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.720]   Well, maybe not, because aren't they going to announce
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.920]   in the month?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   They're going to announce a new, you know,
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.040]   Lori Guilfon.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.840]   They're not going to announce it.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.320]   Great, exactly.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   Yeah, there's a chance that they do have
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.320]   some things in the production line right now
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.640]   that might be negatively affected by the supply chain
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.680]   being shortened and everyone being sick.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.880]   But compared to an iPhone launch in September,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.960]   it's a different level of impact.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.480]   The digit times is saying that at least one third
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.080]   of China's production lines will lie idle in the first quarter.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.480]   Right.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.400]   So, that's a significant drop.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.840]   The bigger challenge for China is,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.760]   I think that the era of us putting all of our production
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.880]   into China is over.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.840]   Yeah, diversified.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.400]   That's a good idea.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.320]   It has little to do with getting ahead of the virus
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.240]   and more to do with, this was a bad idea.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.320]   We shouldn't have been doing it and we're not going to do it anymore.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.160]   And that's going to be, that's going to have a huge impact
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.120]   on that economy as all of these companies rethink
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.960]   their production pipeline.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.440]   And still, a lot of stuff's made in China.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:35.760]   For now.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.440]   If it goes to Taiwan for assembly.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:37.680]   Right.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:46.000]   The stock market took a big dump yesterday as people somehow
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.720]   started waking up and discovering that COVID-19 was going to be an issue.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.320]   CDC warning that we should probably plan
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:02.080]   coronavirus ironically is increasing demand for iPads
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.560]   because people are staying home and using iPads.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.400]   So, it's kind of, it's, we're in Analu's.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.200]   I think that, I think that's a tenuous
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.960]   analyzation. Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.240]   It's again from Digitime.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.640]   So, Digitime has a mixed track record.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.280]   But it is interesting.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.760]   There are Taiwanese outlets, so it's possible that they want to spread the word.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.080]   That's something that positively affects
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.440]   the Taiwanese economy is coming.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.000]   They may have a dog in this hunt as they say.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.800]   All right.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.480]   Let's move.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.400]   I'll just say it's a good thing anyway.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.000]   I mean, maybe this might be an opportunity for Apple to
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.920]   get out of some agreements that were really great agreements 10 years ago
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.720]   when they could block an exclusivity and a massive, massive
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.840]   ability to build lots of product at once.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.600]   But now there's, there are lots of positives to having more diversity
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.960]   with or without the coronavirus.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.600]   It's funny to me.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.080]   Yeah, we were.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.320]   You know, they made fun of our remote work environment for years.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.520]   And now Lori and I are going to be going,
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.280]   "Oh my God, you shot the zombie Flanders."
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.880]   And Lori's going to say, "Flanders was a zombie?"
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.800]   It's just going to just go from there.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.760]   Did you read, I bet you did, because you seem like that,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.520]   that this kind of people.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.760]   Apple's tech reports on the Mac Pro and the Mac Pro display XDR.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.800]   You, you, of course,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.600]   I tried, but...
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.200]   Cover to cover, right?
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.520]   I made so much coffee, Leo.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.000]   I actually started, but I couldn't get very far.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.600]   Renee, how far did you actually get in?
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.960]   Oh, I read them.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.600]   I read through them.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.640]   I can't say I understood everything, but I read through them.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.000]   There is so much technical jargon in there.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.800]   It's a PDF, which we will now proceed to do a dramatic reading of.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.400]   [laughter]
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.200]   So...
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.720]   Introductions.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.600]   Introduction.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.920]   Mac Pro is developed to the singular purpose.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.520]   As you can see, the peak of the coffee red curve.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.640]   Built with...
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:00.960]   You know what?
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.400]   I would pay somebody to, like, audible this.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.520]   Really?
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.040]   Yeah, I'll listen to it in the car.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.640]   I wonder if Apple would get mad at me if I recorded it.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.440]   Oh, you should do it.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.840]   I will.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.800]   Do it.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.760]   What kind of voice do they do?
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.280]   You know, if they try to tell you to take it down,
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.560]   it will make it more popular.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.520]   I think it should be dramatic.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.880]   You remember to say Aluminium, Leo.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.480]   Yeah, I'll say Aluminium.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.880]   Up to 28 core.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   Intel XeonW processor.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.360]   [laughter]
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.920]   Well, however, shift to different drivebades.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.280]   Oh, you can do this shot?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:35.760]   Oh, for perfect.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.720]   He's expandability.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.480]   He's gonna do this shot in Connery version.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.840]   We should do the whole bunch of versions.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.680]   I'll do the Chewbacca version.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.040]   [laughter]
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.320]   [groaning]
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.720]   What the hell is that damn teddy bear doing in the studio?
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.520]   Mac Pro is...
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.320]   Mac Pro is the sound.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.800]   Mac Pro?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.680]   I'm not technically...
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.800]   I'm not technically the most demanding pro.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.400]   What God's designed it is?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.480]   What's happening right now?
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.080]   [laughter]
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.600]   This is all we have left, Lori Gelt, please.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.840]   [unintelligible]
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.160]   So did you learn Renee anything from...
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.080]   I mean, actually, if I had a Mac Pro,
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.760]   I would enjoy this.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.680]   I'd print it out, tape it to the side.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.960]   You know, did you learn anything that we didn't know?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.320]   I mean, there's just lots of detail.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.040]   Up until now, we were mostly getting information from people
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.800]   who bought them and either wrote about them on blogs
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.960]   or podcasted about them or YouTubeed about them.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.560]   And they could make a lot of educated guesses.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.240]   And some of them are really good educated guesses
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.760]   about what exactly Apple was doing.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.840]   And while they don't totally open the communal here,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.200]   because Apple still doesn't explain why they made the choices they made
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.880]   all the time, they do explain a lot of the underlying technologies.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.560]   And it's pretty much what we expected.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.360]   It is a miracle of engineering that applies to maybe 0.1% of computer users.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.440]   There is an expansion slot utility on the new Mac Pro that explains
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.640]   how to take advantage of the fabric,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.080]   the switch fabric of PCI Express.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.160]   I mean, I guess if you had a Mac Pro,
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.960]   if you're somebody like Alex who needs, you know, a lot of bandwidth throughput,
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.440]   this would be useful to see and understand.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.400]   - I'm lacking on his name.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.880]   The scientist who did the review, Gruber linked to it the other day,
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   where he was doing modeling of wind simulations.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.440]   And he said it used to take him like a room full of Mac Pro.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.760]   He had to put a window air conditioner in the room
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.520]   just to be in the same room with them.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.120]   And this ran and I forget what he said,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.680]   but it was something like 14 hours on the Mac Pro.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.800]   Never got noisy.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:31.120]   Fans never were annoying and it was 28 cores and 900 and something gigabytes of RAM.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.960]   And it did what a supercomputer used to do for him.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.320]   So he was really happy with it.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.440]   But again, like that's the specific user that it was built for.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.640]   - Yeah. And the 46 pages, including footnotes of this document,
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.040]   is something that somebody owns a Mac Pro and wants to get the maximum out of it.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.000]   - Or someone would want.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.360]   - Or someone looking at it or someone trying to sell it to their boss
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.320]   about why we should get it.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.240]   Here's the paperwork to show that because...
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.720]   - Right.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.160]   - What this is is a communication to professionals that we didn't give up on you.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.760]   Because there were a lot of us that were like,
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.520]   "Well, we're just gonna have to go to PCs for everything."
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.600]   Because, and a lot of people have,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.120]   because they just didn't have the horsepower.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.680]   The Mac Pro wasn't ever going to do that.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.480]   The iMac, even the iMac Pro wasn't going to get there.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.160]   And so a lot of people were looking at what happens after the Mac platform
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.400]   for them in the professional area.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.320]   And now this says, "Hey, you don't have to go."
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.400]   - You know, you're right, because there is some sell in this.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.760]   Here's this paragraph from the display document app.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.320]   Pro Display XDR reimagines the potential of a reference display,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   overcoming many of the limitations,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.680]   and delivering incredible front-of-screen quality,
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.240]   plus every feature requested by pros, all at an accessible price point.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.000]   There's a little forward way of saying...
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.560]   - They're just interesting.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.040]   - Yeah, right.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.000]   - But it also answers some questions because people were conflating whether it was Mini LED
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.600]   or regular LED, and whether it was single layer or dual layer.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.360]   And this just lays all of that out at least.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.160]   - Yeah.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.320]   Nothing that a competitor would use to try to make a competing product,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.880]   but enough for the buyer and the potential buyer to understand better what's going on.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.040]   - Yeah, I think this is actually a great thing to do more of those.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.320]   They should do one for the MacBook Pro.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:08.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.280]   - They should just do these for any high end gear that they make.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.400]   - Just the keyboard alone.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.280]   What the hell's going on?
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.040]   - We're making video and a podcast.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   - We shouldn't have to wait for iFixit to buy and take one apart to get this kind of information.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.600]   - Alex, I think you're completely right.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.120]   I think there used to be a time where we used to make fun of them,
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.680]   but during the rollout, there'd be like the two minute sizzle reel from engineers
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   and Sir Joni explaining about the engineering behind it and what they put into it.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.080]   I would, given the amount of work and creativity that goes into hardware design,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.560]   and the fact that each design and each choice is part of a five year plan, a 10 year plan,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.760]   I would love it if Apple just did a 10 or 15 minute mini documentary on the technical side
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.440]   of every single product that they do.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.520]   We're all the way from the design all the way down to being able to say,
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.840]   not just saying, we're deleting the headphone port because of courage,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.440]   but saying, well, here are exactly what we can give you in return for this.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.720]   And here's the decisions we've made.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.400]   As a matter of fact, here's what we, here's the problems we had in the iPhone 6
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.160]   and including the headphone port.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.320]   I feel as though Apple misses a lot of opportunities to tell its own story.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.600]   And at some point, there's such an important company for so many reasons.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.560]   At some point, they are going to be studied and for academics and also just people who want to
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.320]   get inspiration for their own engineering.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.560]   Well, you're also, you're competing with, you're not competing for price, you're competing for
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.000]   mind share. And so it is really important that you get every, when you educate everybody,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.960]   because they're not, they, they, you have to explain all artwork. If you buy a million
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   dollars for a piece of paper, you're 200 million dollars for a piece of paper, it's because of the
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.440]   story behind it. You know, that's, that's why that's why you're going to do it.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.360]   The bananas tape to a wall. There's also a consequence of not doing this, which is that we
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:00.320]   and others have to guess, speculate and may get it wrong. Right. So why wouldn't they have a
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.840]   poll? Workflows team, some of the best people in the world who could knock out those documentaries
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.320]   if they didn't let them. Yeah, yes, exactly. Well, there, it's, this is, the white papers are a
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.480]   beginning anyway. I think a good start. Yeah. So thank you. And Apple, we want to encourage you
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.640]   to do more of this. More please. No one's. And I did see some of the members of those teams,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.480]   you know, retweeting the link with an awesome amount of pride and not all of them get to share
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.680]   their work that often. So well, that's another benefit. Right. And it, it, maybe they could put
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.520]   some names in here. There aren't any, but they definitely credit those teams and their hard
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.960]   work and their innovation and they should people need to know what they've done.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.200]   Also, all of us on this panel know, know how good of writing stuff they have. Right. Because
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.360]   most of our friends stole all of our air now. And so yeah, I mean, they could, if you're
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.280]   wonderful to see them produce these sort of documents in house and just just give us stuff to read.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.600]   Like after we're, after we get down from our endorphin high from new shiny,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:01.360]   ooh, look benchmarks, ooh, look to 60,000 tabs, sit down on our commute and just read about
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.000]   everything that went into this thing. I just, I missed that.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.880]   So we mentioned last week that Warren Buffett sold some significant, well, a lot, we made a
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.480]   lot of money on a couple stocks. Still a small fraction of his 5.4% holdings.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.520]   I have 4%.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.080]   The Berkshire Athworth.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:24.640]   Has a very, well, that, so, and there have been a spate of stories since about Warren Buffett,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.360]   the fact that apparently he was using a $20 flip phone for years recently and just got an iPhone.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.720]   He's just, he's not just got an iPhone. Evidently, he did mention that Tim Cook had given him a few
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.680]   iPhones in the past. He just hadn't actually used them.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.600]   But let's, let's be really clear. Warren Buffett has had an iPhone all along.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.120]   It's called a staff of people that are living on his back and call.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.040]   He told me he has that flip phone much.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.920]   Right. Yeah.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.000]   He said he doesn't use the flip phone much and he didn't use the, he didn't use the,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.880]   he didn't use the, he didn't use the iPhone.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.920]   Bill Gates on the line.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.400]   Exactly.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.560]   Here's what I want you to tweet. Are you ready? He's not tweeting this.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.240]   I don't care about carrying accounts. Just tweet this.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.720]   Just tweet it.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.320]   He also says,
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.480]   Load things from science fiction movies to you.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.200]   Jimmy, go.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.080]   You know, that's the thing about billionaires. They live in a world we cannot even imagine.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.440]   I thought, oh, did you see that video? Someone was trying to explain to humans what that
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.800]   amount of money was like. And they're like, here's a grain of rice. That's a million dollars.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.600]   Here's like a whole pile of rice. That's a billion dollars.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.200]   Here's a table full of rice. That's Jeff Bezos's giant vault.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.960]   And it was just startling the amount of rice that actually accrued when you got numbers.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.800]   But it's not even understanding the magnitude of the numbers, which is hard enough.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.640]   But what it buys and the world that you live in where you could perhaps have a submarine in your
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:38.960]   yacht.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.600]   Which is because you don't.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.800]   This was, this was, we always, Paul Allen, who used to own tech TV, had a yacht, very large yacht
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.400]   with a submarine, not only did they have a recording studio in it, but it has a submarine in it.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   And the story was Paul doesn't like to, when he scuba dives, jump into the water.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.560]   He likes to emerge into the water.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.320]   So they built a submarine so he could emerge into the, it's, we don't even, we can't grok
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.440]   what a billionaire.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.040]   They had one of the Bronfman kids, because they're local to Montreal.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.960]   They made their money bootlegging. The Kennedy's made it.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.920]   And they were talking about, like, just growing up being a billionaire.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.560]   And he said that he, what he did was devote his life to ecology.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.800]   He buys buildings. He makes him eco-friendly.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.840]   Then he buys another one.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.600]   And he says he does that because he knows that he would lose his mind if he just,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.960]   because like, I can buy a, I would buy a 747 and crash it into a mountain.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.840]   I could go hunting for any, like, there's just no limits to what he could do.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.040]   So he had to put incredibly stringent limits on himself so that he wouldn't just become one of those statistics.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.920]   Let's put it this way.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.840]   Is it, if you made a million dollars a second, which would be a nice thing,
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.160]   it would take you 30 years to make a billion dollars.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.360]   30 years of a million dollars every second, one after the other.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.200]   Do we ever ask about like, what does that, that's not right?
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.440]   Thank you, but chat room.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.600]   I take a couple hours.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.520]   Take a thousand seconds.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.400]   It wouldn't take that long.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.960]   Never mind.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.160]   You lie three hours.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.920]   It's still a huge amount of money.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.320]   You got me.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.560]   That's a good stat, though.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.320]   I think everybody should repeat that, tweet it, and pretty soon it'll be true.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.360]   Yeah, it'll be true.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.880]   We'll just change Mickey P D L E O L E.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.520]   And when they, when they, when they, when they argue with these, you just say, don't maths blame me.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.200]   Yeah, that's, that is, that is legitimate.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.640]   I think that is a legitimate problem.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.800]   It's a British, the biggest, and American thing.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.880]   I'm not talking about the problem being math, but I'm talking about,
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.760]   when you, when you have these people who are in charge of such really, really important companies,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.240]   and in part in charge of really important economies, many economies,
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.080]   what does it mean when the person who's calling most of the shots
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.960]   has completely lost touch with what's things cost here in the real world?
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.440]   Exactly.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.200]   That when, not only that, but when you.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.640]   It just cost life.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.960]   Yeah, I mean, with Google, right?
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.520]   When Sundar took over, he started reporting things that Larry
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.400]   did not care about, paid no attention to for years.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.640]   And as soon as Sundar took over, he's like, no, these are real numbers.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.440]   These are numbers.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.800]   Billion here, billion there.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.640]   It's like they always say about the Queen of England, everything, the world to the Queen of England,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.000]   the world smells like fresh paint, because she never goes in a room that hasn't just been painted for her arrival.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.080]   It's just, it's a life, life is different somehow.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.480]   Yeah, if you've watched the Queen, you see, just how crazy it all is when,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.920]   before she goes anywhere or does anything.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.120]   Warren Buffett, who owns, I should say 5.7% of all Apple stock.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.880]   He says, I don't think he told us, Squawk Box and CNBC.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.160]   I don't think of Apple as a stock.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.320]   I think of it as our third business, our being Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.040]   It's probably the best business I know in the world.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.480]   And that ownership stake is a bigger commitment than we have in any business.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.200]   Oh, except insurance in the railroad.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.760]   Okay, fine.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.880]   For him, it's a monopoly game.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.040]   I want, you know, Reading.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.160]   And I go.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.280]   And I go, I want to get me an ownership stake in one.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.520]   Apple is an incredible company.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.400]   Buffett continued.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.560]   I should have appreciated it earlier.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.880]   Then I would have had even more money.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.520]   If we'd all just bought stock at the beginning of Macbreak, he does say,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.280]   I am now new using it, but not very often the latest iPhone.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:20.080]   I was, I was, I was, I was working with in 1997, freaked out because his Apple stock hit
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.040]   was, you know, it was like a dollar or something like that.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.000]   And he said, what should I do?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.480]   What should I do?
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.400]   And I was like, buy more, buy more, buy more.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.880]   He owns a vineyard now.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.120]   A yacht with a semarendative.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.320]   I don't know if you listened to me, but you're not working for a living.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.360]   I remember I was doing a personal appearance about 30 years ago.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.280]   A guy drives up in a Rolls Royce.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.040]   He said, I just want to know you bought me that Rolls.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.680]   I said, I did.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.280]   He said, yeah, you were telling me about zip discs when I make it was just starting.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.440]   And I bought into it.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.840]   I said, well, I hope you sold it because it's going down.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.320]   It's time to get a ride home for the bowling alley.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.640]   Timing is everything.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.200]   So let's, I don't know, where do you want to go?
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   We don't do rumors.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   Do we want to do there's so let me take a break and then we will talk about rumors.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.280]   There's a lot of them.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.600]   I'm I'm I'm I'm.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.320]   Yes.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.160]   What was that?
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   I'm I'm proud.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   I'm always saying in Boston.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:14.960]   He's am.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.280]   My goodness.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.400]   You've totally you've totally given over to the West Coast lifestyle.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   You forgot what it was.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.320]   It's an am.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.520]   And the mean streets are going.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.640]   I think he means on.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.560]   I think he's talking about an all.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.320]   And then some births and some deaths and some things to talk about.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.840]   Yeah, but first I want to show you this.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.200]   We have a new sponsor and I'm really excited because I'm a bit of a keyboard nerd.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.760]   A little bit.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.800]   We all are.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.920]   And Matthias, which is a great Canadian company up your well, actually there in Toronto,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.280]   makes the best Mac keyboards I've ever used for a lot less than Apple's Mac keyboards.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.080]   This is one of them.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.000]   This is a wired one that I've been using in the office because I just love it.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.360]   It looks it's slate gray.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.080]   So it matches your Mac, but they also even they even have gold.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.520]   They have rose gold.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.320]   They have all the colors of match your Mac.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.600]   There's a few things I really like about this particular keyboard.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.080]   First of all, it's backlit and there's a little dial that lets you change the color.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.000]   So you can cycle through the colors, which I really like.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.160]   This is the one that I'm using here in at home.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.800]   This is their 10 key keyboard.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.440]   And what I really love about this is it has multi point pairing.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.680]   So Edgar Matthias, I talked to him yesterday.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.400]   He's the guy who founded Matthias keyboards.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.760]   He is their chief designer and he is the ultimate nerd.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:39.440]   He is saying he says he chose to focus on making products Apple doesn't offer.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.040]   So that you can get more choice.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.520]   So they have backlit wireless keyboards designed to look great with your Mac.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   A programmable Ergo Pro keyboard with amazing comfort space and a gel palm support built right in.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.800]   This though is my favorite.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.280]   This one is a 10 key wireless.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.680]   One thing they he does you could tell he's a fan.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.720]   He's a keyboard user.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.400]   One thing they do is they put a bigger battery in this than any other keyboard.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.960]   It's four to 10 times bigger than other keyboards,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.440]   which means when you charge it up and I've charged mine up,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.880]   you'll go a year before you have to charge it again.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.640]   One of the main reasons I don't use wireless is because I hate it that it runs out.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.080]   Can you show this?
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.200]   One of the reasons I hate it when it runs out of battery is not huge.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   It's not heavy, but this has I think it's a 1700 milliamp hour battery,
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   which is like cell phone size battery.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.520]   But by having that kind of battery, a year's battery life,
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.200]   the other thing it has, I love this.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.800]   There's four Bluetooth buttons here.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.200]   Multi point pairing.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.040]   So I use this at home because I compare.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.280]   I pair button one is my iMac.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.720]   Button two is a Linux machine.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.320]   Button three is a Windows machine.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.040]   If you press the control key when you press the button,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.720]   first of all, you pair them and once you've got impaired,
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   you just switch automatically by pressing the button.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.920]   If you hold down the control key, it remaps the keyboard
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.360]   from a Mac keyboard to a Windows keyboard to a Linux keyboard.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.440]   It has all the Mac function keys up here.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.720]   Yes, it has an escape key.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.840]   Thank God.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.720]   It has a really nice T layout for the,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.400]   the inverted T for the arrow keys.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.440]   This is the easiest, nicest keyboard ever.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.120]   They have mechanical switches.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   They're about ready to switch to the Alps switches,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.280]   which are in my opinion, the best mechanical switches
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.120]   better than the, a lot of people use Cherry.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.480]   I think they were using Cherry.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.360]   I love the Alps.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.200]   Alps is the old school mechanical.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.680]   This is more, this is like a more standard,
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.040]   like the Apple keyboards.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.200]   But with enough travel and enough tactile feel,
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.400]   I think this is great and it's a quiet keyboard.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.920]   The wired aluminum keyboard is their best seller right now.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.680]   This is the wireless one.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.920]   Has everything the original Apple wired has
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.360]   and a little bit more.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.800]   But you're going to love how it looks.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.440]   There it is.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.920]   Look at it.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.200]   Looks just like the Apple.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.400]   Apple doesn't make that anymore,
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.200]   but they can, you can get it from Matthias.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.920]   And it has a built in USB hub.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.040]   So you can connect your mouse or wireless dongle.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.800]   There's a second port available,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   which I love when I could sit down at the keyboard.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.680]   Apple used to do this.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.880]   Remember they have a left mouse one on the right
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   and a second USB port on the left for like USB keys and stuff.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.920]   Apple used to do that.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.880]   I love that.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.200]   I'm glad that that Matthias still does.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.760]   There are keyboards for PCs.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.200]   There are keyboards for Linux.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.240]   You know what I love about it?
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.160]   It's a Canadian company.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.760]   So when you call support,
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.440]   they're up there in O'Mara, Ontario.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.880]   There's so not Carmella and Jant.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.840]   They're so nice.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.200]   They're so nice.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.040]   They'll answer your questions.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   They'll walk you through it.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.280]   It is a fantastic, fantastic keyboard.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.600]   I am a keyboard nerd.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.680]   I love my keyboards.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.600]   You will love no drivers.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.760]   It works great with your Mac.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.720]   Matthias, M-A-T-I-A-S dot C-A slash Mac break.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.320]   You could check out the keyboards,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.800]   find something that fits your style and your budget.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.760]   They're very affordable,
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.520]   but we're going to give you an extra 10% off
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   when you go to Matthias dot C-A slash Mac break.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.000]   M-A-T-I-A-S.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.160]   Edgar Matthias is a keyboard nerd.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.680]   We're pulling that all the time.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.840]   I have the old IBM mechanical buckling keyboard.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.520]   It was so much fun talking to him.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.840]   Yes, you can use it with iOS.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.640]   You can use it with Android.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.080]   Anything with there's Bluetooth,
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.240]   but there's the wired ones for USB.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.360]   These are awesome.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.120]   I took this from my house,
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.080]   because I'm bringing it home,
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.120]   because I love this keyboard.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.240]   Go ahead, you can play with it.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.160]   It is that one's just like the Apple keyboard.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.360]   They have others as well,
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.240]   including the Ergo.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.840]   You're going to like it.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.560]   Matthias, M-A-T-I-A-S.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.760]   The keys feel really nice.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.320]   Isn't it?
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.080]   Just right.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.240]   Not necessarily.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.440]   And you see they have at the top,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.600]   they have all the Apple on the function keys,
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.120]   the brightness.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.920]   What do you call that when you press it?
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.840]   All the apps move.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.960]   I can't expose.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.720]   It's so great.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.280]   It's so great.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.320]   That's awesome.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.440]   Media control.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.400]   Backlight control.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.520]   You can switch your backlight.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.080]   You can turn it up.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.800]   You can turn it down.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.400]   You can change the colors.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.760]   I love the little...
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.000]   This is on the wired 10 keyless.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.240]   It has the little bob.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.960]   I should plug it in.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.000]   So you can see the colors.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.880]   It's so much fun.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.360]   I love my Matthias.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.040]   Matthias.ca.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.280]   It's really stable.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:15.760]   Like the...
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.920]   It sits really nicely too.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.240]   Isn't it?
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.720]   Let's turn up the backlight.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.240]   This is a very expensive show for me.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.120]   Oh, you're...
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.520]   Well, you know what?
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.320]   They're not.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:24.640]   This is...
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.760]   I think this is 99 bucks.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.800]   This one's just saying in general.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.360]   They're not.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:27.760]   I just...
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.280]   Too bright in here.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.120]   You can't see, but I can do every color in the rainbow.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.920]   It's so much fun.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.400]   That's awesome.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.640]   Thank you Matthias.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.240]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.680]   10% off MAT.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.400]   I-A-S-S-C-A slash Mac Break.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.600]   You're with friends now.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.360]   We are all keyboard nerds here.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.080]   They do a Devorek keyboard.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.120]   Yes, they do.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   Yes, they do.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   If you're crazy.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.600]   Anybody learn the Devorek key layer?
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.160]   I tried.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.920]   Because I would love to.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.120]   The problem that I had was
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.640]   I started typing...
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.080]   I started programming when I was 10
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.440]   before they taught us any lessons.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.440]   And so I was typing with three fingers.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.240]   Right.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.440]   So I got like three fingers.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.560]   And so I was like,
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.080]   I got to just change my keyboard.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.960]   Otherwise I can't.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.680]   I just got to force myself to relearn it.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.720]   But then I just kept on going.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.000]   I don't have time for that.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.040]   I tried.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.760]   I kept on trying,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.800]   but I just couldn't get to a point
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.640]   where it was fast enough that I could make a turn.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.920]   Like Andy, because you write for living
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.440]   and Micah and Laura,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.400]   you write for living there.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.240]   Maybe there would be a payoff for that.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.080]   I change keyboards too often.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.040]   And like the stuff you get,
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.080]   like if I get a new MacBook
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.120]   or I get a new smart keyboard,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.240]   it's not going to be the Vorek.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.480]   So it would be great for like the keyboard
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.400]   I have at home, but it would just screw me over for anything.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.320]   I had to review or anybody else's.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.960]   Here's a mic.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.680]   I'm at least self-aware enough to know
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.040]   that the problem,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.280]   the log jams of my productivity
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.880]   have nothing to do with my typing speed.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.320]   There are other things such as focus.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.120]   Oh, you think?
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.680]   And just move them.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.560]   Curse it to the right.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   I sat down one morning.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.600]   I got to think in Russian.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.000]   I sat down one morning and wrote 2,000 words.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.320]   And I was like,
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.520]   I could just do this every morning.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.640]   Yeah, that was the only morning.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.080]   Yeah, one morning I did that.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.320]   Well, that was the Stephen King thing.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.520]   He said to George RR Martin, right?
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.640]   He goes, you wake up,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.480]   you're right, you're doing your 20 pages.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.680]   And then you flip it for your day.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.280]   And Martin just went and throttled him on the stage.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.760]   This is the best writing advice I ever came across
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.040]   was just in a podcast with a screenwriter
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.600]   of the usual suspects.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.040]   He said, some days you just got to,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.280]   you're just there trying to move the cursor to the right.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.200]   And I'm like, that is exactly correct.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.520]   All you got to do is keep moving the cursor to the right
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.120]   and not focus on anything else.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.920]   And you get things written.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.400]   The greatest podcast episode of all time.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.440]   It was a, he's on stage.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.800]   He's on one screen.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.680]   Yeah, script notes too.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.960]   He did a script notes guest appearance
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.840]   a few months ago.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.040]   It was really good.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.000]   Mm.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.320]   Sorry.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.680]   Let's see.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   Mark Gurman in Bloomberg.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.320]   Did we talk about this last week?
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.040]   I can't remember.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.080]   Which one?
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.640]   Which one?
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.520]   It's writing his best.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.040]   Mark Gurman in Bloomberg.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.000]   Apple is considering, this is just a rumor,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.680]   letting you choose your default iPhone apps.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.480]   In other words, make them a new iPhone.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.440]   I know it's Bloomberg.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.600]   I know it's not Gurman, but they write it as like,
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.560]   they're my city council.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.320]   Where they're going to put together a commission.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.440]   Apple may put together a commission to study the feasibility
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.240]   of moving a committee.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.720]   It's kind of a soft rumor.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.240]   To make a policy tool like, and they know they like to hedge,
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.000]   you know, their papers of record, they like to hedge,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.400]   but I just wish that they would just let them write sometimes.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.600]   Well, I almost, I feel like this might even be a trial balloon
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.240]   from Apple.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.440]   Because first of all, this has got to be in response
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.200]   to any competitive accusations.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:33.760]   Right.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.200]   So instead of using Safari, you could use Chrome or Firefox
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.960]   or our sponsor Brave.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.320]   Instead of using Apple Mail, you could use Canary,
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.280]   which is what I use.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.600]   I would like that so that when I click a link,
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.040]   it doesn't always open Safari.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.560]   I think it makes sense.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.800]   I think that Apple should do that.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.000]   I think that I'm not in the camp that believes
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.040]   Apple should be forced to do anything related to this,
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.800]   but I think that them doing is a good business.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.840]   I think it's a good business decision.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.360]   I think it's user friendly.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.160]   User friendly.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:04.880]   It lets people do that.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.920]   It's better for their apps too.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.200]   They'll be forced to compete and make them better
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.400]   if they want people to use them.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.640]   Oh, that's an interesting side effect, isn't it?
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.320]   And they'll still have the huge advantage of being pre-installed
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.280]   on every phone.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.840]   So it's not as though they're going to lose the eyeballs of people.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.240]   But those of us who have to use Gmail or have to use Outlook
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.840]   are going to be a lot less stressed out and a lot less annoyed.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.960]   But what seemed to be arbitrary decisions that Apple has made on their behalf.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.480]   Well Steve hated this idea, right?
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.960]   Like he thought that if he did this, Google,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.480]   and they were fiercely competitive at the time,
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.960]   Google would come in and just make it a Google phone.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.920]   And Facebook would come in and just make it a Facebook phone.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.400]   And people would be in his opinion,
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.880]   junked up with all of these Adware and Spyware.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.680]   He was not a happy person in terms of Google and Android competition.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.360]   I think that he might have been in the early days,
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.240]   he might have been right.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.360]   I think that a lot of the apps weren't very well developed.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.720]   And there's a lot of those pieces.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.880]   And so I think that the fact that they're doing it now
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.440]   is because they were a pretty good chance of probably retaining 60-70% of that market at least.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.600]   And they've built it out over time.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.720]   I mean they had to do so.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   Originally those apps were basically the services.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.920]   They were indistinguishable.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.480]   If you wanted to send an email, it had to pop you into email
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.920]   because that's where the functionality lived.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.240]   And then when they made extensibility and all the other things,
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.560]   they were able to separate app logic from interface.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.240]   And you could suddenly have different mail apps with a share sheet popping up.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.480]   And then you were able to offload apps.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.720]   You could delete them and reload them from the app store.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.000]   And all of that sort of architecture was never built into the iPhone to begin with.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.520]   And year after year, they've been suddenly adding it to the point now where,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.880]   if you want to switch to Gmail, Gmail is still going to have to do things like,
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.960]   they're going to have to add a way for you to press that button
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.480]   and have a sheet come up and display a version of Gmail that's optimized for inclusion
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.120]   and other apps.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.200]   And Google takes forever to update anything.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.480]   So who knows along that'll take.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.360]   But all those steps had to be carefully laid down for them to do that, I think.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.040]   So it's not just policy, but it's also implementation.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.440]   Right.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:59.040]   One thing Apple has announced with Safari is, I think, a little concerning.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:05.360]   They've announced that Safari will no longer respect security certificates
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.920]   that are valid for more than 13 months.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.360]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:17.120]   Well, we buy our certificates for our domains for two years,
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.960]   because I don't want to have to constantly renew them.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.240]   That means what?
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.000]   Well, there are companies out there that do them every 90 days, and they just--
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.080]   Oh, let's increase does it every 90 days.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.760]   So but then what you do is you just have to have a system that is constantly--
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.000]   Let's encrypt doesn't do the wild card certs that we need.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.280]   I don't want to have to do this twice.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.600]   You know, twice as often.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.480]   I don't understand.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.520]   What's the security bit?
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.000]   Are they still expensive?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.040]   Yeah, they're very-- it's 800 dollars for a two-year wild card cert.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.720]   I do think that one wide-ranging effect of this is that it does separate out the
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.320]   organizations that take security seriously versus the ones that are just going to do the bare minimum
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.600]   that they can do to keep their app or their service operational.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.440]   We do have a problem with old certificates that go on for years and years and years,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.960]   and that is simply-- it's sort of like when you go into a restaurant and you see that the
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.520]   restaurant looks fine, but the bathroom is dirty.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:16.720]   That's a sign that you've got a malaise that's permeating the entire system.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.760]   Security system-- my understanding is that security certificates were never meant to be--
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.840]   you get one rubber stamp and you're good to go.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.520]   It's they're meant to be renewed.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.400]   They're meant to be recertified just to make sure that the entity that owns the certificate is still
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.680]   the entity that originally purchased this certificate a few years ago.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.760]   As I-- admittedly, I'm talking from the point of view as a user.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.200]   As a user, I feel as though this will lead to more secure websites and better protection of my data.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.800]   If I were creating a service, if I were operating an app and would now
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.760]   enforce to spend a lot more money or go through a lot more trouble, I would certainly feel differently.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.520]   But I do think this is a good thing for users.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.240]   And very great to go for Apple.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:04.400]   I agree with you that it's good for security purposes, but Leo is a perfect example of the--
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:12.720]   I think that it may be a two-year, maybe 25 months would be a little bit easier on the
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:19.040]   pocketbook for some people, especially if two years is a very common time frame for certification
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.640]   updating. 13 months is maybe just a little bit too short.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:28.080]   And the question is, are people charging what they charge now because most people take a long
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.440]   time between certifications? Will the price go down or will people start taking advantage of that
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   increased frequency to make it less expensive and easier to use?
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.280]   I mean, I can see services getting out there going, "Hey, we're going to automate this process
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:48.320]   and start moving it down the path so that it makes it easier for people to do it more and more often."
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:55.520]   And I think a lot of the companies making-- that are like Apple or Google and others,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.640]   I think they're going to keep moving that goal post forward. I think that they want to keep on
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.000]   making it more and more secure.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.600]   The issue-- and I'm sure Steve will talk about this on security now later today.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.840]   The issue is that certificate revocation is a system that has never worked.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.880]   In fact, Google just threw up its hands and said, "You can't. Don't."
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:19.680]   So if a certificate gets out that's bad or corrupted or compromised or counterfeited,
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:27.120]   what you would like is a way to tell all the certificate authorities and the browsers all use
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:33.200]   the same certificate authorities, "Hey, that certificate says it's IBM. It's not. Don't honor it."
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:39.280]   But there's no way to do it because for a variety of, I think, political reasons but also technical
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.480]   reasons people have decided that, "No, we're not going to support revocation."
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.920]   We've talked a lot about that on security now. So if you don't have a way to revoke certificates,
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:54.160]   if a certificate is good for however long it is, two years-- I don't know what the max that you can get.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:00.080]   We do two years. I think that's the only option I have. But if there's a 10-year-- that would be a
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:05.280]   bad thing because that that compromised certificate would continue to be good for years. So that's
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:11.120]   the theory is, "Oh, everybody-- in fact, I think that's probably what Apple wants. This is an intermediate
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.840]   step. It's going to go into effect September 1st." That means anybody-- So you're in a month, Grace.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:21.280]   Yeah. Anybody who wants ultimately to-- yes, because if you already have a certificate by
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.640]   September 1st, you'll get a year in a month. Then anybody who wants to be accessible to
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:33.120]   by Safari had better fix this. And I imagine the ultimate game is to get it down in 90 days,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:39.520]   which is what Lett's gonna be. And to do that, it's gonna be a mess, but you're gonna need to
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.960]   automate. Right? That's encrypted is automated. I don't have to think about it. I have Lett's--
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.320]   Feel like a subscription. Yeah. I have a Lett's Encrypt certificate. And it's free. I have Lett's
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.760]   Encrypt certificates on my NAS and a variety of other things. And they just automatically,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.040]   every 90 days, actually, even shorter get a new one. That's good. It'll be the latest technology.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.520]   It solves this non-existent revocation problem because a certificate isn't good for more than 90 days.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.800]   It revokes itself. It revokes itself. But--
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:12.000]   Yay, yay. I mean, look, even the federal government, even-- I mean, how many times have we seen
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.440]   certs expire and sites stop working because some of-- Even major stuff. Yeah, major. Oh, I forgot.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:25.120]   Twitter or whatever. I forgot. So-- I just worry. I think it's gonna be kind of messy.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.360]   Yeah, I think it will clear out a lot of things. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Sometimes
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.440]   you just got to-- Like in the Godfather, you have to-- You gotta get rid of all the bad
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.480]   bloods, but accumulating over the past 10 years. You gotta do this thing from time to time.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.080]   Well, they are moving-- Well, Google actually put this proposal in front of--
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:51.600]   tried to do it right with the CA browser forum in 2019. And it was voted down.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.840]   Google wanted to make-- reduce TLS certificate validity periods to one year.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:02.000]   Thousands of comments from users-- this is digit certs memo about it. That's the certificate
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.080]   authority we use. Thousands of comments from users which mostly showed opposition due to
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.360]   additional work required by IT teams to handle shorter validity periods. The ballot failed,
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.520]   which means maximum certificate lifetimes are two years. So two years is the longest.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.520]   At one time, you could get three years. They were reduced to two years. So Apple is
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.840]   unilaterally saying, "Well, couldn't get it through the ballot." Google does this too, by the way.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   Google did it right. Apple did it right now. Yeah.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:34.640]   And that's enough. They're big enough important enough browsers that people are going to have to
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:41.120]   just say, "Okay. I think I remembered that our cert authorities-- we use GoDaddy and
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.200]   Digi cert, and I think that they have said that they're going to make it somehow automatic."
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:52.960]   But it's a pain. I just re-upped our certs for Twit and the Tech Guy.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:58.720]   I think they're both with GoDaddy because they gave us a better deal. Sorry, Digi cert.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:05.600]   Because I would rather go with Digi cert. But now I have to get the certificates onto the servers.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.240]   Russell-- I have to get them to Russell who put them on. It's a process. It would be nice if it's
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.760]   automated. Maybe it will. But it's costly. I think it opens up an opportunity for business
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.680]   to find a way to make it easier. That wasn't there. People were doing it every two years.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.600]   This is going to be a problem. And then people start coming up with solutions.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.240]   I think that we'll see. But I do think you're right that I think that we're probably looking at 90
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.600]   days. Eventually they're about three to five years from now. It'll be 90 days.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.640]   It's going to be like passwords. It'll be so inconvenient to be writing their certificates and
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.080]   little post-it notes on their screens. Well, right? And that, by the way, I want to remind everybody
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:45.440]   that the NIST folks who said you should change passwords every six months have rescinded that.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.280]   That was a terrible idea. They made it up. There was no value to it. There were lots of downsides
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   to it, created chaos. So sometimes these-- But you look at it. You look at it. I mean, we talk
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.480]   about this because we've got a big thing across the front of here. What changed for me is LastPass.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:07.040]   It's easy to change passwords. Well, not only easy to change passwords, but I just have
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.760]   hashes for everybody. You know, like I just like last pass. If you have good password security,
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:16.000]   there is no value in changing it every six months. That doesn't do that. That compost is nothing.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.680]   And also, I don't-- because it's not connected to anything. It's literally a hash for everything.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:24.640]   And so everything-- and they all have different passwords. They're all hash. And it went from being
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.160]   this chaos where I don't understand what I'm going to do next with my pay. And no matter what
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.480]   you're using, whether it's one password or LastPass or whatever, you have to have that right now
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.600]   until we get to a point where it's all biometric, which is where Apple's trying to--
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.120]   Yeah. So long too. Security is hard. I understand. And there's usually a trade-off between
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:47.040]   convenience and security. And I guess we'll bite the bullet and we'll-- Russell? I got a job for
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.440]   you, Russell. Well, maybe we can automate it. I love Let's Encrypt, but they don't do the
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:58.800]   wildcard search that we need. Yeah. Use routers secured with HomeKit, says Apple.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.280]   Add more protection to your home accessories by controlling which services and devices they
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.040]   communicate with on your home Wi-Fi network and over the internet. This is something we all want.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:12.800]   Because right now, your IoT devices provide a nice highway into your network. And if they're
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.280]   insecure, you're insecure. But maybe Renee-- How much do you want to work for?
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.840]   Should I do a dramatic reading of how to set-- First of all, who makes these secure routers?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.680]   More companies have signed on. Yeah. It's a HomeKit initiative that they can sign up for.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.960]   I think Euro and a few others have signed up for it. But it's been-- Laurie keeps asking
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.680]   you, are they out yet? Are they out yet? I've been looking around. Almost. And it's been a year.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:43.280]   It was the last WWDC, right? Let me see. Here's the list. Boy, it's a short list.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:49.040]   Euro announced. Euro Pro announced. Links is well-unounced. That's it.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:57.280]   So that's probably good if you see this setup. I'm really surprised. Given the lack of interest,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.160]   I'm really surprised Apple just doesn't go, "Okay, we're going to build our own router."
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.760]   You know that-- They used to, right? Yeah. That's the whole thing. It's not like they never did one.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.600]   And the thing is that this whole HomeKit thing is such a disaster because Apple's
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.840]   waiting for the industry to do everything rather than just going, "We're going to put it out.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.560]   We're going to start putting out devices." And then you guys can try to keep up. And then you guys
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.920]   can try to keep up. Google bought the industry. There's very little industry left. They've bought
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.800]   almost everyone making this stuff. So the thing is that HomeKit, I don't think, is ever going to
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.480]   work until really work. Because I'm the target audience. I would put HomeKit across everything.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.080]   And I haven't touched it because it just looks like this big mess. And I'm the guy that would
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.280]   put it all through a big house and have security and have the whatever and HomeKit is the one I'd
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.440]   want to use. But I just look at it. It just looks like a big morass that I don't want to touch.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.120]   And I'm just waiting for it to settle down. And it just never settles down because Apple's not
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:50.080]   giving it enough leadership by actually creating products that will show us it working.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.160]   I just wish it were a little easier. Well, it would be easier if Apple just built it.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.640]   If Apple starts to persuade people to follow and set a guidelines and just made it,
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.800]   I'll do it because we use your own app. And then they all kind of overwrite the Home app.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.680]   And it just it causes chaos. I've had to reset it like e-times.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.320]   Well, and by the way, if you already have, this is from Apple's tech support note. After you go
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:15.520]   through a bunch of steps, you got to find your routers, iOS or iPadOS app in the App Store.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.880]   Use it to set up your router. Wait for the app to ask you to add the router to the Home app.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.800]   And tap accept. If the app doesn't prompt you to add your router to the Home app, use your router
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.680]   manufacturers instructions. Continue set up in the Home app by following on-screen instructions.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.280]   When you're done, you'll see a notification that says the setup was successful. By the way,
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.200]   that one sentence covers a lot of territory. There's a lot of stuff going on there.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:41.920]   After set up, if you already have Wi-Fi home kit accessories added to the Home app, remove them,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:48.240]   reset them, and then add them back to the Home app. And again, I think that I think the router is
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.000]   probably the most important thing for Apple to build. Like Apple should just build a router
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.880]   that does this. And because it would allow them to say, "Okay, this is how everybody's going to link
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.360]   into it," rather than letting all these guys and trying to figure out some standard. This is why
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.840]   Apple generally builds its own stuff and doesn't do this, is because it doesn't work. You know,
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.080]   if you want everything to work together, just work together.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:15.120]   Does this help with the issue of an insecure... See, I'm not worried about the devices that are
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.720]   Home Kit compatible. The fact that the company's gone to the effort and expense of being a Home Kit
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.280]   enabled device probably means it's secure and it's going to get patches and it's going to be up to date.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.960]   It's not those devices. And you can quarantine stuff that's on the network that's misbehaving
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.600]   if you need to, which is a nice benefit. So it is... It will add some security, but it's adding
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.320]   security. The most secure device is already in your house. Not the weird Chinese camera you
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:46.160]   bought on Amazon. So anyway, there is a setting then that you can switch on Home Kit accessory
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:52.800]   security. You get to choose the level of security, restrict to Home, which actually means your
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.080]   accessory may only interact with Home Kit through your Apple devices. So not only does it not connect
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:02.400]   to the internet or local devices, but you can't get firmware updates. I mean, the only thing,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:08.560]   the only router that was easier to set up than the Apple router, in my opinion, was Maraki. And
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:13.760]   Maraki's really expensive. So, like, that's the only thing that I found easier to do.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.960]   Well, the Apple team made Eero, and I think they made a lot of the ubiquity stuff too.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.440]   Yeah, Eero's one of my Apple trees. I'll vouch for Eero again, a sponsor, but I think they're
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.960]   very easy. I'm actually really happy.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:27.040]   Yeah, Amazon bought them. And Apple, how much are they really going to support Home Kit?
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.560]   Everyone is buying everything, and the Home Kit options are getting smaller and smaller.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.640]   That's a good point. I just think it's not going to go anywhere until Apple just steps in.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.320]   I just bought it. I switched away from my hue lights because they were rolling on the camera
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:43.520]   when I had 24 frames per second, 180 degree shutter speed. So I replaced them with expensive Quasar
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.480]   science lights. But I hated it because I lost all the Siri and Home control. So now I have an
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.800]   Eve Elgato power strip with three plugs in it, one for each light, and I can turn the whole thing
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.640]   on and off individually. And it's fantastic. But like, Eve is one of those few independent
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.960]   companies that are still making things that weren't bought by Samsung or bought by Google or anybody
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:07.440]   else. Well, and that's Elgato, which did sell everything, but the Eve stuff off. So who knows
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:12.400]   what'll happen? Yeah, exactly. I think it's Quasar now. Yeah, Quasar bought it. I ran into the
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.600]   Quasar CFO on the way to CES. Oh, yeah? And he said, yeah, we own Elgato. I didn't know that.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.200]   It was kept on a couple of years ago. Yeah. So all the TV stuff, all the... Yeah, I was
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.640]   talking about their green screen stuff and it was the one up there. It was like, Quasar. Yeah,
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:31.520]   isn't that funny? All right, let's tack am. Is it like a Smat Pack?
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:40.720]   So again, this is rumor. And in fact, it's a rumor from Ming Chico. So I don't... Or his favorite.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:48.240]   Is it that you like saying Ming Chico? No, I'm going to get myself in trouble in these days,
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.680]   but he used to be somebody that we could really rely on for these kind of leaks and rumors and
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.480]   and insight into the pipeline. But now it seems like he's just throwing anything in a wall and
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:04.720]   seeing what sticks and we're still relying on him for these leaks and rumors. But he throws so much
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.280]   out now that it's not even like the percentage of that stuff that's right is much, much smaller
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:14.800]   than it used to be. So, you know, we liked it because he was in China and had the access to the
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:21.760]   supply chain, presumably. He now has his own firm. He... MacRumors got his analyst note
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:28.800]   talking. Well, I'll read the salient paragraph. We expect Apple's new products in 12 to 18 months
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:35.680]   will adopt processors made by a five nanometer process, which would be amazing, including the new
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:43.680]   second half of 2025 G iPhone, the 2H20 iPad. When he says, by the way, second half, it's of Apple's
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.720]   fiscal year, not of our calendar year. So that's next year's iPad equipped with mini LED.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:55.040]   Oh, that's interesting. I knew those are the fall... The fall updates that are going to come
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.960]   after the spring updates. It's a double... It sounds like a double iPad update cycle, like
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:06.400]   2012. And then he's talking first half 2021, again, fiscal year, Mac equipped with their own design
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:12.480]   processor. What would it... with their own designed processor? Presumably the arm processor we've
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:18.400]   been talking about. God, better not be Apple X86. That would be hilarious. That would be funny.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:28.000]   So, it won't be. It'll be arm. One H21 Apple fiscal is what calendar? Next year.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:38.160]   Beginning in next year. Well, no, it's first half of 2021's fiscal year. Their fiscal year ends
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:45.040]   in March or September. No, this is first... I think they're fiscal year. This is Q2 right now.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:50.720]   I think. Q2? Yeah, first... Okay. So the thing that struck me with this...
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:57.600]   This fiscal year begins in September. It begins in October. So the first half 2021 is actually
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:08.160]   October 2020 through March 2021. I don't know. Yeah, maybe. It's a very weird... We've been talking
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:14.080]   about the possibility of Mac OS on ARM. Maybe ever since the first MacBook, nothing, when you see
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:20.720]   the teardown. And it really looks like a device that was intended to run a really, really high-powered
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:26.880]   but mobile processor in terms of thermal limits and power and actual real estate inside the casing.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:35.520]   But even as I keep hearing more and more rumors, I don't understand how a Macintosh or a MacBook,
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.520]   the way that we understand it to be today could make that switch without having some sort of
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:50.240]   an x86 interpreter, which would absolutely tank performance. So I don't... I have to keep telling
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.880]   myself that if this is a real thing, it's probably going to be... I feel as though it's going to be
[00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.640]   a sort of device that we haven't seen before. Either they're going to be making a new edition of
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:08.240]   a Mac Mini that's more like an Apple TV in terms of form factor, or maybe even they're going to...
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.680]   they're going to create a brand new kind of Mac that implied in the design of the thing is that,
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.720]   well, you're not going to want to run legacy apps. You're not going to want to run Intel-based apps.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:26.240]   This is going to be more like a Chromebook sort of thing where we're going to find a way to sell
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:34.480]   a $500, $600, even a touchscreen MacBook, maybe even calling it something else, that will run every
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:41.040]   modern app that people or that developers are coming out with. The development is going to be
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.160]   inclined more towards the sort of apps that are going to be multi-platform to begin with. So
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:53.920]   you'll have a native Mac app, but it's going to be based on an iOS app. Basically, I don't think...
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.760]   I can't imagine a scenario in which we... in a year or two, we're able to buy a MacBook or a
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.400]   desktop Mac that is based on ARM. I think that they're going to create something that kind of sits
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:11.600]   between a standard Macintosh and a high-end iPad. So the thing that struck me is that the
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.000]   analysts pushed back on this, like Ben Beherrin is very keyed into Silicon. And a couple of them
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.480]   were saying immediately, "Ah, I love these stories, but I don't think so. I don't think that's the way
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.880]   they're going." And I do find it interesting. I think if it happened, Apple would come out and
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.320]   it would be almost like a repeat of Steve Jobs' original power PC to Intel Switch, where Max
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.920]   has been living a double life because people have said they've had our Macs going on 10 years and
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.760]   they used to dangle them like the sort of Damocles over Intel's head whenever they had a delay.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.640]   But shipping them would be... we're going to be transitioning to this over a year. You have the
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:51.200]   iPad Pro. You have the Apple, whatever, new Apple TV they put out in the next year or so. Those
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.000]   are your surprise. Those are your development devices. If you put this firmware on it and you
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.600]   attach a keyboard and a mouse, you can start porting your apps. But I believe to sort of fix what Andy
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.160]   was saying is that it would be the absolute, I don't want to say lowest end, but the most hyper
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.360]   mobile version of the Mac, it would run macOS because they can make an iPad clamshell tomorrow
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.160]   for kids doing tests in schools. That would just be a clamshell iPad. But it would be something that
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.800]   you wouldn't really need. It wouldn't be a Mac Pro. It wouldn't be a Mac Pro. It wouldn't be running
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.040]   anything that an Alex Lindsey would run, like Maya or anything like that. But it would run
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:31.120]   iPad or catalyst versions of most of the apps. In the old days, your Big Warrior was Adobe and
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.640]   Microsoft and a couple of the big suites like that. There's progressive web apps. There's Google
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.760]   suites. There's all these sorts of things that take a little bit of the edge off of that. That plus,
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.280]   if it's a WWDC to WWDC cycle, you'd have a year to sort of get the already good Microsoft
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   ARM apps, which they're also building for Windows 10, 10, Windows X, 10, Windows X, whatever that
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.080]   combination of, I can't take branding anymore, whatever that combination of letters is. I think
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:05.680]   that at least for the 12-inch MacBook and that Apple TV style Mac mini that Andy's mentioning,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.440]   that could be a very interesting first salvo for the first year, year and a half.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:16.640]   I definitely think for that mobile, hyper-mobile 12-inch, 13-inch machine, I think that it totally
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.520]   makes sense. I think an iPad with a touchscreen and the ability to use a mouse would go a long way.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:28.400]   With a handful of apps, you start telling developers, "Well, if you recompile or if you hear the tools
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.200]   that you need to move your app out of Intel into ARM, if you decide that that's what you want,
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.640]   Adobe's not going to do that." But Microsoft would probably do that.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:46.480]   The apps that make sense get moved over to this piece. I do think that the iPad is the
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.720]   the, there is this little chasm of use that sits between the Mac, the MacBook and the iPad,
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.400]   where the iPad is not quite where it needs to be and the Mac isn't quite where it needs to be.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.960]   And I think this could fill that little gap pretty effectively.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:05.040]   So I was, one of the things that I was even more skeptical, I was five nanometers. They're
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.760]   already at seven with the A13. And one of the reasons I was skeptical is that, and this is from
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.880]   Wikipedia, the five nanometer node was once assumed by some experts to be the end of Moore's law.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.080]   These are marketing terms, right? These aren't actual terms. They're not actually five nanometers.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:27.200]   Oh, okay. They might, so they decoupled them. So Intel says their 10 nanometer process is
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.400]   equivalent to... Well, that's Intel, because... TSMC is seven nanometer. And everyone will tell
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:38.480]   you that Samsung and TCS, or Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing, have different processes for the
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.800]   same number that they put on the sides of the process. Yeah, because both Samsung and TSMC claim
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:51.600]   five nanometer production. They have... They say they'll have it this year. Here's the issue.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.920]   You wanted to read this last sentence about five nanometer.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.800]   Ah, let's see. Where was it? I just lost it. Oh, transistors smaller than seven nanometers will
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.240]   experience quantum tunneling through the gate oxide layer. So that's how small you're getting,
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.840]   although there is apparently a three nanometer node and even maybe a two nanometer node.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.400]   With that kind of tunneling, you could be sitting on your laptop just disappears.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.560]   You saw Avengers Endgame. You know the absolute consequence. I mean, that's just wild. But I guess...
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:27.600]   So you're saying that Samsung and TSMC's five nanometer process isn't actually five nanometer.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.480]   It's unclear what the actual size is. I'm sure an Antech has the number somewhere,
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.120]   but it remains unclear to me that these are anything correlated.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.840]   It doesn't really matter because... Someone has been ridiculously small.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.720]   Apple's used TSMC. I mean, it doesn't really matter.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.560]   I think somebody's just getting out there with a caliper and just figuring it out.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:46.800]   We measure that. It's pretty small. It's pretty small.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.960]   It's nanometer small. Yeah. Billions of a meter.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:06:01.200]   By the way, if you took a millimeter every second and to get to a meter, it would take 30 years.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.680]   If an ant crawled, I mean, a millimeter a second.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.080]   It would take 30 years to get an enemy. No, that's wrong.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:18.800]   So apparently five nanometers is possible. It's very tiny. You get a lot of benefits
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:24.480]   in size lower power chiefly, but also higher speed, the interconnects are closer.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.560]   I, you know, compatibility is the big issue. And honestly, they're already doing... You can already
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.480]   cross compile and Xcode to the arm. You don't... You know, and I guess you're using some sort of...
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.160]   They got rid of 32-bit apps. So it'll be a simpler... If they do, I agree with Andy,
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:45.440]   it'll be horribly inefficient to do it. But if they do it, they've greatly simplified the story
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.840]   of what they would have to emulate because of the 32-bit app.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:53.840]   And let's not ignore that. Let's not ignore the basic benefits of Apple designing the whole
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.560]   widget inside and out. We've seen the amazing amounts of performance and power savings they
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:05.520]   can get from iPads and iPhones simply by saying practically nothing we buy is going to be off
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.800]   the shelf. We are going to design this chip to work with this chip under this operating system
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.440]   tuned to the apps that are designed or these APIs. It would be super, super exciting to see
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:21.360]   what Apple could do with a more conventional desktop OS style computer when they do get to
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:28.400]   design there and the entire widget inside and out. Like I said, I think that anybody who's thinking
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.160]   "Oh, it's going to be like a MacBook Air, but it just runs arm. It'll run for 18 hours on battery."
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.280]   Probably not that because I don't understand how that would work.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:44.560]   Is anybody going to the shareholders meeting tomorrow? 9am at the Apple campus?
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:51.600]   Get invited. Well, if you're coming from China, I hope you arrived two weeks early.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   Apple has just put this notice out. Following the official guidance on COVID-19 from the CDC,
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.120]   we ask shareholders who have traveled to China in February to ensure they have completed
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:11.440]   the required two-week quarantine period prior to attending the meeting. In other words,
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.400]   when did they put that out? Just minutes ago.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:20.640]   So they're saying, "Oh, by the way, 14 days ago, you should have
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.800]   quarantined yourself once you got out of it." In effect, they're saying, "If you've been to China
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.920]   in the last months, don't come." I appreciate it. I know that you've traveled to China.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:38.400]   There are people here in the US that are self-quarantining right now. So hopefully,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.680]   they've done this, but definitely, maybe they should have put that out
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:50.000]   more than two weeks ago to give people a little reminder of, "Don't forget, quarantine yourself
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.560]   for two weeks before you come to this meeting, please." I brought this really expensive ticket,
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.240]   and I got them staying at the Ritz. You should have bought a time machine when you bought that ticket.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.720]   With the quantum tunneling, I used to go. How hard is that going to be, though? The people who
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.760]   are motivated enough to go to actually attend a shareholder's meeting in person are probably not
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.440]   the sort of people that are used to being told don't do something that you want to do.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:21.600]   That's what makes this outbreak so hard to figure out, that there are so many people that they don't
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:29.120]   feel as though they're part of a pandemic, and that, "Look, I feel a little bit under the weather,
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.080]   but I'm just tired because I've been working all day for three days, and boy, it's going to cost me
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.120]   $1,000 to stay in China for an extra two weeks or to quarantine myself for to change these tickets.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.280]   I'll just go now." I don't know how you tell a shareholder who's there probably to tell angry
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:51.360]   things to the board to say, "Yeah, but the thing is, you just got off a plane and we just don't
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:58.000]   want everybody to die." Especially if they're the CEO of Foxx Congress. The CDC today revised their
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.360]   virus warnings to say that it's probably going to be a pandemic. You should start preparing now.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.640]   I wonder what's going to happen to conferences. Venice has already canceled carnivals.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.560]   There's some rumors starting about it. We got RSA here in San Francisco today. We're going to
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.240]   a big last-pass party tomorrow. Should I wear a mask? What should I do? Don't shake anybody's hand.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.880]   Okay, here in Boston, we have PAX East, the big gaming conference, and Sony has already
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.680]   dropped out and other big company has dropped out. It's still going on, but these are going to be
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:34.960]   two really, really big anchor presentations. Sony was going to show, give people the first
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.880]   hands-on experience with The Last of Us 2, which was going to be just an epic, epic event.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:50.240]   But I can't imagine not only the problem of being a huge trade show with lots of people, but
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.640]   in a venue where you're encouraged to please put your hands on this thing that thousands of other
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.240]   people have also put their hands on. I bet that there's going to be like, purerled by the bucketful
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.400]   and the real problem is because there's such a long incubation period on this, you can be
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:11.760]   you can have the illness and be communicative weeks before you show any symptoms. So there
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.640]   we just don't know. And saying, "Bend of China," well, you should change that. "Bend of Italy,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:23.280]   Bend of Iran, Bend of Japan, Bend of Hong Kong." I mean, it's a much longer list than just Bend of China.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.840]   I was going to be a jerk until Andy. They were going to show the 3D version of the Playstyle
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.040]   as well, and it's a huge loss for all of gaming.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:37.680]   See, once again, particularly when I was younger, I used to get a lot of crap that,
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.400]   "Oh, look, look at the pale nerd who spends all the time alone inside. We are the people who are
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.240]   going to live on to take over the world because no skin cancer and also because I'm not
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.000]   getting touching anybody anywhere." We're all pale nerds now, baby.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.480]   Do you have a hazmat suit, Leo? Do you have your hazmat suit ready?
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:00.000]   I was lucky because I found a bunch of N95 masks that I had saved from the last
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.720]   wildfire. So we have those. I don't know. If you come to the last past party,
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.560]   I'll be the guy with the mask with the twit sticker on it. I don't know. I just don't know
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.920]   what to do. I guess the good news is most people get it won't die.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.080]   In the vast majority.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.120]   Well, you fight the virus and you fight the cure.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:26.080]   The percentage is higher than the regular flu. I think what is it?
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:26.800]   It is higher.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.360]   A little more than 77,000 people have...
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.240]   The percentage is 25 times the regular flu. That's why they're working.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.120]   It's 25.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   So, yes. That will die from the flu. Yes, that's exactly...
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.120]   Yeah. So, I would say percentage wise, you're looking at something kind of dangerous there.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.720]   Leo, I can see it in your face that you're worried about this.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.520]   And I think you're in this very awkward position of,
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.760]   should I follow my health heart or should I follow my business heart?
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.720]   And that's a really tough decision to make right there because your health
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.560]   heart is saying, don't do this.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.560]   Well, and it's a little worse because I'm over 60.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   So, I am not a young man. I'm very healthy. I barely get sick.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:23.040]   Remember, wash your hands, wash your hands, and get the habit of not touching your face.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.360]   That's a hard one. I've been trying to do that.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.280]   I asked the chatter on Sunday, tell me when I touch my face,
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.760]   you touch your face, you touch your face, you touch all the time.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.720]   I did that with hot chili pepper today. I cut a bunch of Thai jillies and I just don't touch your eyes.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.320]   Within three minutes, I touched my eyes.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   Screaming is pretty hard.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.080]   Hot chilies on your hands, and that will remind you not to touch your face.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.920]   No, it's a lorry.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.320]   Lorry is basically saying, train yourself like you would train your cat not to lick the furniture.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:14:01.200]   So, the only way I got around that was by getting in the habit of carrying a handkerchief or a bandana in my back pocket,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.560]   or in the winter months, I have the really good scarf.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.880]   So, anytime I really absolutely have to scratch my nose or I will die,
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:14.240]   I feel as if I don't rub my eye or I will actually just take out the handkerchief
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.600]   or I will use my scarf to do that because that has not been touching handrails and subly things.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.080]   But yeah, and I haven't gotten really sick in a long, long, long, long time.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.880]   Again, possibly because I'm the boy in the plastic bubble, but I take rest.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.520]   I think that if you don't go out technically speaking,
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.680]   I'm getting ready. I'm going to be ready. I'm going to hire a light model decoy Leo.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.320]   Can you like have a robotic stand in Leo? Lisa said, this is great.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.440]   She said, if you don't want to go, Micah and Ant can go.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.920]   I said, well, I don't want to kill them either. That doesn't seem like a good idea.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.280]   Can you send my bow?
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.520]   They're young. Those rolling iPad Skype, Skype bots.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.520]   I have one of those. Yeah.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.280]   Send that.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.760]   This is why ninjas never work. You just look like a ninja.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.080]   Like, how are you supposed to be stealthy in a guy like that?
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:09.760]   All right. I'm ready now. No, actually, Andy, I do carry a handkerchief with me at all times.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.720]   So I'll just, you know, is this good?
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.400]   It's going to be monetized now because you look like you're asking, holding Andy for ransom.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:23.840]   Also, you know, touch your eyes. Maybe if I were, you know, gloves won't work as you still
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.240]   are touching something and then touching. You seem to be face masking.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.480]   - But one of the things we think about is like,
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.620]   combat face masks.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.660]   - Choggles.
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:30.500]   I got goggles.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.340]   - From one of those effigulls.
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.100]   - How about the, the, the huge beaks from the,
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.240]   from the middle ages?
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.400]   - I said, no, no, no.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.380]   - No, it's left and now he's basically building
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.520]   a hazmat suit.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.360]   - Exactly.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.700]   - There is an in-de-gogo.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.220]   - Stormtrooper cosplay.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.340]   Tax deductible stormtrooper cosplay.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.180]   - You could go his phasma.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:52.180]   - There is an in-de-gogo for plague doctor masks,
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.800]   for, and 95 masks.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.360]   So you could have the beak.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   (laughing)
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.760]   And, and walk around.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.880]   - Yeah, that would be a good mask.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   And just say, yeah.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.720]   - You could keep people away from you.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.560]   - Carnival.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.840]   - Well, you have to fight the virus
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.840]   and you have to fight the fear.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.360]   It's a double, that's why these attacks
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.040]   are always double, double damaging.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.480]   - Hmm.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.960]   All right.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.880]   - We did, we required $20 to release the NOTCO.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.080]   - Stay, stay healthy.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.160]   We love you, Leo.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.680]   (laughing)
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.760]   - Well, if I die, it's, I died in a good cause.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.600]   - There you go.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   - Making money for twins.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.800]   (laughing)
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800]   - That's not good.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.720]   - No, that is not a good cause.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.120]   (laughing)
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.920]   - Not good enough to die for.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.760]   - Fine.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.560]   - You did it, boo.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.000]   Let's see, what else?
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.480]   What else do you wanna talk about?
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.320]   Ah.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.840]   (sniffing)
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.680]   - Please don't say air pods late.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.280]   - Can't forget any more air pod late.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.880]   - Steve Jobs would have been 65 yesterday.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.560]   - I don't have retirement age, but for him.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.360]   - No, it doesn't feel like Steve would have ever returned.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.280]   - Yeah.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.120]   I wonder, I wonder though, if he, if it's,
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.080]   he just had that really, excuse me,
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.840]   as an outside observer who's only met him once,
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.080]   like if it's interesting to think what he would have done,
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.480]   if he was, if he had remained in perfect health,
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.960]   if he were restless enough that he would have retired
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.640]   from Apple but moved on to something else,
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.760]   it's interesting to think of what he could have done
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.040]   even privately in philanthropy.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.200]   It's, it's, I mean, I'm not interested
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.160]   by what he would do at Apple,
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.480]   but what he would do in the rest of the world.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.680]   - Lorraine, his wife is actually doing a lot of philanthropy
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.840]   with his estate.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.200]   So yeah, that's an interesting question,
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.720]   but I think, you know, he's a huge loss.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.960]   - He's a product guy though, right?
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.480]   I don't know if he could have, like Bill Gates,
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.560]   I still can't believe Bill Gates,
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.360]   who was like power of software,
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.520]   he's done amazing things,
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.200]   but just to walk away from Microsoft,
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.920]   some founders never leave.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.400]   - No, I know, I think credit to Bill's wife, Melinda,
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.760]   who early on convinced him to create the Gates Foundation,
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.800]   and I think his helped guide him in a very positive way.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.640]   - Absolutely.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.360]   - And so I think Lorraine would have done
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.840]   the same thing for Steve, to be honest.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.560]   She's always been very politically aware.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.720]   - That looks back to what we're talking about earlier,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.280]   that I think that a lot of people, myself included,
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.520]   if we had that kind of wealth,
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.520]   like we fantasize about that kind of wealth,
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.600]   the fantasy is not only, okay,
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.240]   you go nuts for maybe about a year,
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.160]   and you have Sylvester Stallone singing at your birthday party,
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160]   all that sort of stuff.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.640]   But the ability to simply say,
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.560]   oh, here's an organization that says,
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.080]   we could eradicate this disease for $80 million.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.520]   Okay, right, you check.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.160]   Done, put your money where your mouth is.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.920]   Or all the way down to,
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:57.080]   there's a underfunding for a school lunch program.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.320]   So well, guess what, congratulations for the next 10 years,
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.120]   at least, all school lunches at your school are free.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.840]   And don't you put my name on anything?
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.040]   That's what impresses me about certain,
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.680]   when people achieve a certain area of wealth,
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.480]   where it's not like, gee, I can essentially buy this,
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.320]   buy this golf course and this small town next to it,
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.120]   and turn it to my private estate.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.280]   Like, that's one of the things that's so admirable
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.240]   about what Bill Gates and others do with their money.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.840]   'Cause that was literally, the Gates Foundation,
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.760]   literally, it's like, hey, really,
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.760]   you're saying that we could absolutely eradicate polio
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.480]   and certain kinds of blindness by just writing a check?
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.400]   I have a check.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.560]   Great, but I do wonder if like in the back of their mind,
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.360]   like Bill, like still doing everything that he did
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.040]   for charity, but in the back of his mind going,
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.000]   well, if I hadn't let Steve take over,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.680]   maybe we wouldn't have lost mobile,
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.160]   or if Steve Jobs did the same thing,
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.280]   he would have said, oh, my home pod would have sold
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.840]   a billion units in the first year,
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.120]   like just those sorts of perseverating plots.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.560]   The guy who was on the Xerox Park team
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.560]   that showed Steve Jobs, the Xerox graphical interface,
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.040]   the menus, the mouse, and inspired Jobs
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.280]   to create the Macintosh has passed away, Larry Tesler.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.720]   He joined Apple shortly after that in 1980,
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:20.080]   worked through 1997 as an Apple Vice President,
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.680]   passed away Monday at the age of 74.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.560]   A couple of things Tesler was well known for.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.600]   One, his license plate said no modes.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.640]   In the early days of Apple,
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:33.800]   this was part of the user interface guidelines,
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.200]   and of course, Larry was a UI guy.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.880]   And one of the things Apple really didn't want was modes.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.400]   In computing, you know, with a command line computing,
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.240]   it's all mode.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.400]   You're doing what you're doing,
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.640]   and then you do something else.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.480]   And but once you got Windows, there was a kind of a debate.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.400]   And there were a lot of what we call modal dialogues,
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.720]   where boxes had popped up
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.000]   and wouldn't let you do anything else
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.520]   till you clicked the link.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.800]   Larry said, no, no, no, there shouldn't be any modes.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.400]   You should be able to, you know,
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.560]   move around in between Windows at your will
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.520]   and do whatever you want.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.600]   You should never be locked into something.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.320]   By the way, you know, while he won that battle,
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.280]   I don't know if he won the war,
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.160]   because the iPad is famously modal.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.240]   - Right, even iTunes.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.640]   Remember those iTunes pop-ups?
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.840]   - Yeah.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.200]   And there are some things that have to be modal,
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.040]   but I was always impressed,
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.920]   and I talked a lot about that
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.840]   in the early days of the MacIntoshe idea of no modes.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.000]   He also created something that we use every single day,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.520]   probably every hour, cut, copy, and paste.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.240]   He invented the idea and thank goodness.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.560]   - He converted the idea from print,
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.840]   'cause what print did was it wasn't cut, copy,
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.880]   and paste, but it was cut and paste.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.400]   You would cut something actually out
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400]   and paste it over something else.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.080]   - I remember, you know, early on learning about writing,
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.960]   and I can't remember if it might have been
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.280]   shrunken white or so Carson probably remembers,
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.320]   that was the advice, you know,
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.360]   after you've written something,
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.960]   cut out paragraphs and moved them around
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.040]   and paste them in different places.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.880]   Literally cutting and pasting with, you know, wheat paste.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   He of course did, it was Command C, Command V and Command X.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   - But think about, just think about how,
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.840]   it's very easy for us to understand that concept,
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.000]   because it's part of our vocabulary right now.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.360]   But imagine when you have this physical thing,
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   of physically cutting things from one to another,
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360]   thinking that that would be an interesting thing
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.880]   to implement somehow digitally at a time
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:33.560]   when graphic user interfaces are, wow,
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.080]   look how accomplished we are getting back to having
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.840]   a mouse move a cursor and pulling a drop down menu.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.840]   - It was a mind-busting thing when it first appeared
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.560]   on a mainstream computer, and it's amazing to think
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.200]   about someone who can create something from zero,
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.560]   to just imagine this thing existing
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.880]   without something else to refer to in the tech world
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.520]   because of that.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:03.200]   I will never downplay that, and because that is a special
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.760]   kind of brain, that is a special kind of imagination.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.800]   - It was probably the zero, I'm thinking it was the Xerox star.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.160]   - Yeah. - That they were shown,
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.560]   which was very early, it was considered
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.080]   an office productivity tool.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:19.320]   I think copy and paste really misses the real point.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.960]   It's the clipboard, that's the brilliant invention.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.200]   The notion that you have this storage,
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.280]   you don't see that you could put something onto
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.520]   and retrieve it from later, is really the kind of
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.240]   the seminal invention. - It was also human-related.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.680]   He was so good at human-related,
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.440]   making technology human-related.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.520]   - I mean, you think of where it's come from,
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.480]   the fact that, I mean, every day now I just go,
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.600]   I can copy something on my computer,
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.400]   and then paste it on my iPhone.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.240]   My clipboard is a virtualized,
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.640]   and all my devices, I'm just kind of like--
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.120]   - Isn't that amazing? - Amazing, amazing.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.640]   Every time I do it, I still knock on over it,
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.200]   where every time I paste between devices,
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.040]   I'm like, this is amazing.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.640]   - I use it all day, every day.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.440]   - So thank you, Larry Tesler,
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.720]   really one of the great minds at Apple,
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.120]   a guy who was very influential in what happened
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.760]   with the Macintosh.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.880]   He worked on the Lisa as well.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:06.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.280]   Also, as long as we're talking passings,
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.880]   I mentioned this on Sunday.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:19.760]   Is it Evan Sutherland?
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.960]   Passed away, and he was an internet pioneer,
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.000]   probably less connected with Apple.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.520]   He worked at Bolt-Baranek and Newman
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.520]   when the original internet was CrearpaNet.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.360]   I'm gonna pull up his obituary 'cause I'm doing it terrible.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.440]   - Yeah, but what I'm really looking at up,
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.800]   this is what I'm on about,
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.080]   about wishing that Apple would document itself,
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.520]   it's in history a lot more,
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.880]   because we need all of these pioneers
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.520]   to tell their stories and get those stories down,
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.840]   because history can forget that there was a person
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.360]   who saw cut copy and paste as the fulcrum
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.880]   of pretty much everything that was gonna be coming
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.000]   in the next 10 years.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.680]   It wasn't just something that someone noticed,
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.400]   someone, a scientist noticed a bird cut copy and pasting
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.960]   in nature and decided to duplicate that.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.880]   And without that sort of history being recorded,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.640]   without that first person testimony being saved,
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.520]   we forget how to innovate,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.120]   we forget how to develop products,
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.840]   and we create wrong expectations for exactly how hard it is
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.560]   to really push the needle when it comes to developing a product.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.000]   - So one advantage I have is,
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.280]   it's been around a long time now,
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.640]   and I remember these guys, I remember these names,
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.240]   and I remember those stages,
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.280]   and I remember going from a Z80 running,
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.560]   running CPM to MSDOS.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.000]   - I remember when they added layers to Photoshop,
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.640]   and I was like, "How many do you know what to do with this?"
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.000]   Like I had to think about it for a little while,
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:51.920]   I was like, "Layers,"
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.520]   and then David B. Edney, who's one of the early trainers,
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.160]   and Bert Monroy, they had a class in South San Francisco
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.720]   on the new Photoshop and how to take advantage of layers,
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.000]   and Bert was up there showing.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.760]   - Yeah, we talked about that.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.040]   - But it was fascinating, I had to go to a class
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.640]   to make sure I understood how to take advantage of it,
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.720]   'cause when I saw it, I was like,
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.840]   "I don't know what I would do."
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.880]   - It was a brilliant insight, actually.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.440]   So it's Bert Sutherland, Ivan Sutherland's brother,
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.080]   Ivan Sutherland, very well known for graphics.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.360]   Bert was American computer scientist,
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.200]   he passed away on the 18th, he was at Sun, he was at Park,
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.360]   and he was at BBN and helped develop the internet.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.240]   He also was participating in the creation
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.880]   of the personal computer microprocessors,
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.440]   small talk, Java, and the internet.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.440]   - Little bit, little, little, little bit of stuff.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   So, you know.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.640]   - It's also worth pointing,
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.880]   if you go to the Computer History Museum,
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.360]   they have a bunch of texts,
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.760]   but they've also been putting up videos,
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.080]   and they have long, like, multi-part interviews
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.560]   with Scott Forestall and a lot of your old Apple engineers
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.200]   just talking about all of this stuff,
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.040]   and everything that Apple hasn't preserved,
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.800]   they've been doing an amazing job
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.720]   of getting those people in there and recording them,
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.560]   and just end up talking about it.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.120]   - Andy, Efolklore.org, Andy Hertzfeld, not Andy Hertzfeld.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.120]   - Andy Hertzfeld.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.800]   - Keep folklore.org current,
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.720]   'cause that was a great repository,
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.280]   and still up, of very useful original Macintosh stuff.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.240]   I don't know if there's been anything recently posted there,
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.840]   but if you wanna read the lore
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.280]   of the original Macintosh, Andy Hertzfeld,
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.200]   one of the original Mac team.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.160]   You can hear, like, for example, Scott Forestall saying,
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.520]   "Well, the secret origin of the iPhone
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.040]   "is that Lorraine had this friend
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.400]   "who worked at Microsoft, and he came over to dinner,
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.760]   "and he's like, 'We have this tablet,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.960]   "'it's gonna just destroy you, and Steve got so angry.'"
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.800]   - Remember that?
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.640]   - Yes.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.040]   - You have to work, and remember that story.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.480]   - Yeah.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.960]   Anyway, so a couple of legends,
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.880]   very important people in the Computer History.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.320]   Also, if you saw the great movie,
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.920]   Hidden Figures, Catherine Johnson,
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.760]   who was the mathematician, who helped Apollo
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.280]   get to the moon, passed away this week
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.560]   at the age of 101.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:00.400]   - What a great lead.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.920]   They asked her for the moon, and she gave it to them.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:03.760]   - Yep.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.680]   (laughs)
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.800]   Wow, wow, very impressive.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.640]   - Of the calculator.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   - Interesting study.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:14.640]   We talked about this earlier on iOS today of Smart Speakers.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:21.400]   These Smart Speakers study from Northeastern University
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.080]   Imperial College of London.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.360]   They took all the Smart Speakers,
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.160]   including Apple's HomePod, the Google devices,
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.320]   the Echo devices, the Cortana devices,
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.320]   and made them watch TV 125 hours of Netflix content.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.400]   With cameras pointed at them to see
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.980]   when they activated accidentally.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:51.160]   There's the test set up.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.640]   - I don't have any fights in there.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640]   (laughs)
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.680]   - They did a similar study recently.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.680]   I think the same lab did a similar study
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.520]   on asking the same question about smartphones,
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.440]   by isolating them from all other distractions
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.680]   and seeing if they were collecting information
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.880]   strictly at the microphones.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.720]   And they came to the same conclusions
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.360]   that it's just not happening.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.040]   That--
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.880]   - Here are the findings.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.120]   So first, the question everyone's worried about,
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.960]   there is no evidence they were constantly recording.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.280]   They do wake up frequently,
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.760]   but short intervals.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.680]   How often do they activate?
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.880]   The average rate of activations is between
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.160]   one and a half and 19 times a day
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.640]   during our experiments.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.960]   Home pods and Cortana's activate the most
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.320]   followed by Echo dots, Google Home Mini
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.400]   and Echo dot series three.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.440]   This is the weird one.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:45.160]   And I think though anybody who has one of these devices
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.840]   in their living room knows this,
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.120]   they don't occur consistently.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.920]   So they did this 12 times
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.040]   and only 8% of the activations happened every time.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.840]   At least 75% of the time.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.960]   - Why they're so maddening.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.640]   - Yeah.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.120]   Sometimes they activate for the strangest wake words.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.560]   Sometimes they don't activate for their own wake words.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.800]   - Yep.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.760]   - Are there any TV shows that do not cause activations?
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:10.880]   No.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.280]   All shows cause at least one device to wake up at least once.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.000]   (laughing)
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.840]   Some activations are really smart though,
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.560]   then they were just behaving for the test.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.720]   (laughing)
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.840]   The Gilmore Girls in the office are the worst.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.040]   They're responsible for the majority of activations.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.400]   It's cause they have a lot of dialogue.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.240]   There's a lot of talk.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.160]   - And they say, they say, any sort of two.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.560]   - They say, sorry a lot.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.480]   In most cases the activations aren't long enough
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.560]   to save sensitive audio.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:46.560]   Echo dot two and saves the longest 20 to 43 seconds.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.320]   Home pod and the majority of echo device
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.960]   is more than half the activations last six seconds or more.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.400]   So yeah, I guess they are long enough
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.640]   to get you doing other things.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.200]   Do you wanna know what the fake wake words are
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.380]   for the home pod?
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:06.520]   Words rhyming with high or hay,
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:09.960]   followed by something that starts with S and a vowel.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.280]   Or when a word includes a syllable that rhymes with re,
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.080]   as in siree.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:19.920]   For example, he clearly, they vary,
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.400]   hey sorry, okay yeah, and seriously,
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.840]   I've had that one get me many times.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.880]   - The first season of "Brazed Anatomy"
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.120]   'cause they keep going seriously seriously,
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   it was constant.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.600]   - It was constant.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.040]   - High misses, face, funeral, historians,
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.640]   I see, I'm sorry and they say.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:40.720]   - You wonder, you wonder what percentage
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.920]   your audience's series get activated.
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.320]   - You wonder if they can put metadata in
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.440]   so that if you have an Apple TV
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.200]   actually producing the content,
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.520]   it could talk to your home pod and go, no, no, not that.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.960]   - Like, just like little tags along the show
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.000]   where it would just tell all your devices
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.760]   that are on your network that just not at this moment.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.600]   'Cause it's not, you have all the tags.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.920]   - Or at least because it has all those microphones,
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.960]   you could steer it towards here is the location
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.440]   of the speaker of my television.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.800]   Please ignore any kind of concept.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.840]   - And that speaks, yeah, that doesn't count, yeah.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.880]   - Well, again, the Apple TV would know that it's on
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.320]   and be able to tell the devices,
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.680]   match the signal that I'm putting out to--
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.080]   - That seems a lot more complicated than it needs to be.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.360]   But then again, a lot of these systems,
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.800]   I know that Google and Amazon have systems
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.720]   at the back ends that if it's getting a lot of false
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.720]   activations, like I mean, like across the entire network,
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.560]   it gets the idea that, okay, there is a,
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.280]   somewhere there's a commercial that has something
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.000]   that's triggering this device unnecessarily
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.520]   and then for the remainder of the 80% of devices,
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:52.080]   it will say ignore, if you hear something like this,
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.200]   ignore this, or rather, I'm not gonna respond
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.760]   to this thing at this moment right now.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.720]   - Or sarcastically.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.160]   Like, this morning we tested the HomePod
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.160]   and we asked, we asked the HomePod how much wood
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.640]   would a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:13.000]   And Siri said, a wood chuck is, it's a groundhog.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.360]   It's not gonna tell you.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.680]   (laughing)
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.680]   Because it's more likely to tell you
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.680]   that winter's gonna last longer.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:18.520]   - That's a good one.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520]   - It's more likely to tell you that winter--
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.800]   - That's a very good one.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.800]   - But the Amazon said 700 and, the Amazon solution
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:31.760]   was 770, I think 774 with the wind at their back.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.560]   - So, you know, too very different.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.720]   - How much wood could a wood chuck a chuck if a wood--
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.720]   - It was a good chuck.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.560]   - Okay, hold on.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.400]   - Let me ask Google.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.160]   - How much wood could a wood chuck chuck
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.720]   if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.640]   Excellent transcription, I might add.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.320]   (mumbling)
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.240]   - Different, each with their own hypothetical
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.480]   chucking abilities, still from my read of the literature,
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.760]   one would have to chuck at least their own body weight
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.840]   to be competitive.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.280]   - That's a good answer.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.800]   - Very nerdy, I like that.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.920]   - By the way, in the voice of Isra Ray,
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.520]   which is kind of even better.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.960]   (laughing)
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.840]   - We got in the conversation because of the Geico commercial.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.760]   - Yeah, those wood chucks.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.760]   - Apple has got some paying to do $440 million to be exact.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.920]   On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear Apple's appeal
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.880]   to avoid paying $440 million in damages
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.880]   for using Vernet X's internet security technology.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.280]   By the way, Vernet X is what we call
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.160]   a non-practicing entity, an NPE.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.640]   - Which I don't think should be allowed to have patents.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.480]   - I agree.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.320]   - You don't activate your patent.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.520]   If you don't do something with your patent
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.760]   in X number of years, you shouldn't be allowed to have it.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.600]   - This should be a lot of suing.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.320]   - The suit's been going on for 10 years.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   Back to 2010, they filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.960]   - So the question that I have for this
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.240]   is it appears that they lost the judgment.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.040]   Then after losing the judgment,
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.400]   they invalidated almost all the patents.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.080]   Then they are, but somehow the court says
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.280]   they still have to pay.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.120]   Seems very odd.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.840]   - Court of appeals.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.760]   - Which is for Washington, which does the patent disputes,
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.520]   upheld the judgment and the Supreme Court declined to review.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.400]   - Supreme Court, no, the Supreme Court or the federal,
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.360]   I think that the United States Supreme Court.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.200]   - Oh, there you go.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.400]   - I don't think there's anybody above that except God.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.560]   - I thought it was, I thought it was.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.880]   - And the president.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:29.800]   - So,
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.600]   - The hey, Glio, you can take it to the hey order.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.440]   - Take it to the hey.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.120]   - They're gonna have to pay it.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.960]   - They're gonna have to pay it.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.040]   - They got the money.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:37.880]   - Yeah.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.320]   - It's like a half a day of work.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.040]   - Yeah, half a billion, big deal.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:47.360]   - I think we have concluded the, well, we could,
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.960]   I don't know, I do want to do rumors, car key feature.
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.320]   We'll let you send digital keys using messages.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.160]   That's kind of cool.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.480]   If you want to drive my car, I can message you.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.200]   - I want this for every, from like keys.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.200]   - Yeah.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.520]   - So, so, is that what the rumor is that?
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.640]   Is that already in the faded data?
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.400]   - I think it's in the code.
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:06.240]   - Yeah.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.400]   - So that's not really a rumor.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.200]   - No, it's just win or will it actually, you know,
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200]   come to fruition?
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.920]   - It's in the 13 for base.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.320]   - I'm dreaming of key keyless.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.720]   - By the end of this year.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.920]   I'm close.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.000]   Like I'm down to two keys.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.680]   - My new car is a keyless.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.760]   - My next car is a car company is gonna have to support it
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:23.840]   and they're glacial and they're not.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.280]   - But keyless like you don't have a fob?
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.120]   - No, it's a fob.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.040]   - But that's something they'll, they'll,
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.000]   they'll use to upsell you to the next model of aspirational car.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.600]   Google is putting the same thing into Android.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:37.320]   The interesting thing from here is how much,
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.440]   how many restrictions are the users
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.120]   are gonna be able to put on these keys?
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.760]   Like can you put on, can you create digital keys
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.800]   that expire automatically in 24 hours?
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.040]   Are they creating digital keys that can only be used
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.840]   on this actual device?
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.520]   I was talking to an engineer at Volvo three or four years ago
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.400]   when they introduced this kind of technology
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.920]   into some of their upper tier cars.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.760]   And one of the things they were talking about is they're
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:05.520]   hoping to sell more cars to fleets so that a company
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.080]   who has just a fleet of company cars,
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.920]   they could simply, if someone needs a car for the day,
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.680]   they could simply email them or issue them a digital key,
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.240]   essentially having their own private ride sharing
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.000]   or car rental system.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.040]   So are, is there going to be a flurry of apps on the app store
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.760]   to create your own like private rental,
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.720]   a beach rental SUV system?
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.200]   - Well, I also am interested in the, like the valet saying,
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.800]   this key will not open the trunk,
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.480]   but will open the door and allow it to start.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.640]   And when I leave this location, it'll invalidate.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.040]   Like if you're even here, it's not gonna work anymore.
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.160]   - Or even better for a valet or your kid saying,
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.040]   I'm giving you a digital key that tells the car computer
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.800]   speed limit this car to 40 miles per hour
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   and also deactivate if it tries to leave this geo-fenced area,
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.360]   just like you can create valet mode in your regular cars.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.120]   - Turn all the cameras on.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.720]   - Turn all the 360 camera.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.640]   I was kind of amazed that I don't even,
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.960]   I still don't know how it did it.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.960]   My, you know, I was borrowing Colleen's car.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.040]   - And you drive the finest view.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.600]   - I know, I was so, so Colleen Henry,
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.960]   who used to work here had a, has an I8,
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.360]   and I was driving her I8 around.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:17.200]   - Like a femur.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.320]   - Yeah, but it does a three, it does this crazy thing
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.840]   with the cameras where you're,
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.560]   I was driving out a parking lot and I looked at the camera
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.640]   and it showed a 360 degree, it looked like it was from above.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.560]   - You can see the car, yeah.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.400]   - You can see the car and I was like,
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.560]   okay, this is, I've had that for years.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.840]   - I know, I was new for me.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.520]   - Welcome to the 21st century.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.680]   - It was new for me, I was like, I need,
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:36.760]   I don't even know what I would do with this.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:37.600]   - No, I'm kidding.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.000]   - I wanna follow drone.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.920]   - I wanna get a mustang monkey.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.760]   - Oh yeah.
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:42.600]   - That is a carless entry.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:45.040]   In fact, it doesn't even have handles on the door.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.280]   You just walk up, twitted up, he's free.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:50.800]   - So should I, should I wait,
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.760]   should I wait two more years to buy a car
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.200]   so that I can wait around for a car key?
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.000]   - I've been waiting, that's how,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.440]   my car died was because I was waiting for the next,
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.000]   I keep on going, well I can go another year,
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.360]   I can go another year because the better car will come out.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.680]   But I do go back to Andy's point,
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.000]   I think that the drone has to go into the car,
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.080]   like and it launches out of the car at speed.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.560]   And just so you're driving, you know,
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.880]   I need a little bit more,
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.160]   I need a little more perspective.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.480]   And the drone just pops out of the car and goes up
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.200]   and goes and see what's going on
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.080]   and comes back and lands in the car while it's moving.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:23.920]   - I see you, you're close to.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.760]   - It's very Batman.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.080]   - Like Spider-Man.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.640]   - Let's take a break, your picks, gentlemen,
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.080]   prepare them and ladies.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.440]   - Oh Leo, before you break, they just,
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.760]   Bob Iger just resigned.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.280]   - Of Disney.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.120]   - Yeah.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.520]   - Wow. - Active immediately.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.040]   - Bob Chapick has been named
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.880]   the chief executive officer.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.160]   - Interimental Apple buys the company.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.240]   - Amazing.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.320]   - Iger will stay executive chairman till next year.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.400]   - So why did he resign?
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.080]   Was he, was this planned or?
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.440]   - He's been trying to for a while, right?
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.720]   And they just keep saying, no, don't go,
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.400]   you've done so much for us, don't go.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.600]   - And then one of his heirs fell through
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.880]   and another one fell through and,
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.760]   but it goes back to that Bill Gates Steve Jobs thing
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.920]   where I guess he feels like he's done enough.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.760]   - Yeah.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.160]   He has done enough.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.280]   Yeah, you know, he's only a little older than me.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.560]   - Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel.
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.440]   - If I had done all that, I would retire too.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.320]   - He's run out of things I loved as a child
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320]   that he could ruin.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.600]   - He owns 80% of my childhood.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.920]   - Meanwhile, I have to go to the last past
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.160]   his party tomorrow and catch COVID-19.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.080]   - In Ironman suit.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.800]   (laughing)
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.200]   - No, I'm gonna be there, but if I,
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.720]   but I won't, I'll just elbow bump, right?
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:35.560]   - Exactly.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.400]   - Don't even elbow bump, just not.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.240]   - Don't even do that.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.560]   - It's a kind nod.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:39.400]   - A nod.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.240]   - If I nod at you, I'll be happy to see you.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.840]   - How about a regal wave, Leo?
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.680]   - Yeah.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.520]   - Can you do a regal wave?
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.720]   - Of course I can, like you're screwing in a light bulb.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.880]   - There you go, do that.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:47.960]   - Yeah.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.200]   I'll just, you know, maybe they'll have a booth for me
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.400]   and I can just be in a seal.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.240]   (laughing)
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.080]   - Yeah, it was a wave.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.000]   - Like a poppa, medical mobile.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:55.840]   (laughing)
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.200]   - Like a poppa, milk golf cart.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.520]   - A leo mobile.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.120]   - A leo mobile.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.760]   No, I'm not worried, I'm very healthy.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.240]   Our show today brought to you by,
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.000]   brought to you by Casper.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.040]   Actually, you know, I was talking about this
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.880]   with Micah and iOS today.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.120]   The highlight of my day lately has been going to bed.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.240]   Is that crazy?
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.520]   Isn't that the best feeling though,
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.480]   when you, the most been a long day, you're tired.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.160]   You finally, you know, you're getting,
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.560]   you're getting the, going to the bedroom
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.160]   and you pull back the covers and you're getting
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.560]   such a good feeling you pull the covers up.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.760]   And for me, it's all 'cause of my Casper.
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:35.320]   My fabulous Casper, an online retailer,
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.160]   premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.880]   I don't care, however much it costs.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.080]   I don't care.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.400]   I love my Casper, but you might care.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.760]   The fact that Casper's are so affordable,
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.960]   partly because they don't have a showroom.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.040]   You know, the mattress store markup is up more than 100%.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.560]   Casper sells direct to you.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.760]   And so they can give you a great deal.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.920]   The Casper products are obsessively designed.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.160]   Look at that, it comes in a small box.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.760]   This is a king size mattress.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.960]   In a box, the size of a, you know, a dorm room fridge.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:10.120]   You open it up, the bed goes, shh, and it's amazing.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.240]   The original Casper combines multiple supportive memory
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.160]   foams for a quality sleep service with a right of mouth,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.720]   of both sink and bounce.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.400]   It's breathable, designless, you sleep cool.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.840]   That's really important.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.000]   Regulates your body's temperature throughout the night.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.640]   Gives you a better night's sleep.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.000]   And I think I'm not alone.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.120]   20,000 reviews, an average of 4.8 stars on the Casper site
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.160]   on Amazon and Google.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.720]   It is becoming fast becoming the internet's favorite mattress.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.400]   I know it's mine.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.320]   Another, a variety of Casper's.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.360]   There's the Wave, which features a patent-pending premium
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:45.040]   support system that mirrors the natural shape of your body.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.160]   The Essential, a streamlined design,
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.480]   but at a price that won't keep you up at night.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:52.720]   And the one I just opened up and I sleep on the hybrid,
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.800]   it's got durable yet gentle springs.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:58.720]   So it provides the pressure relief of the award-winning foam,
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.960]   but also has a firmness.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.880]   And I'm a little heavy, rolling out of bed.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.320]   The springs give me that edge.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.640]   It's a nice firm support.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.440]   I don't fall out of bed.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.280]   I can get out of bed.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.560]   It's very nice.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.880]   Casper offers a wide array of other products, too.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.160]   The pillows, the sheets, the Casper Go glow lamp.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.680]   I am such a fan.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:21.480]   You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:25.840]   free sleep on a trial, free shipping and painless returns
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.080]   to the US and Canada.
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.600]   So there's no risk at all.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.080]   Right now, we're going to get you $100
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.160]   towards select mattresses.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.040]   If you go to Casper.com/macbreak, $100 off,
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.520]   but you have to use the code MAC BREAK at checkout,
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.080]   terms and conditions apply.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:44.880]   That's $100 off select mattresses by going to Casper.com/macbreak.
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.560]   Enter the code MAC BREAK.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.040]   At checkout, Casper.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.320]   I love my Casper.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.480]   I love it.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.440]   I think I'm going to go with Lori's pick today.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.200]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.880]   Oh, I thought you were saying that you're just
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.320]   going to go buy what my pick of the week is today.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.240]   I am going to buy it.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:08.600]   I bought the 12 South AirPod container.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.520]   I bought the blankie.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:11.800]   I've been very happy.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.160]   I bought the airplane pillows.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.840]   So this one, you might just kind of nah for this one.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.520]   But I am super excited about it.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:23.480]   So March 20th, Animal Crossing New Horizons
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.960]   comes out on Nintendo Switch.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.360]   And Animal Crossing is one of my favorite games.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360]   I have a lot of fun with it.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.560]   I collect all the Mibo.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.600]   Tell me why I should play this.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.080]   Because I've tried and I don't get it.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:42.120]   It's definitely-- it depends on what you enjoy playing.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.200]   It's very much a time management kind of game where you go
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.560]   and you collect little things and you craft things
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:48.480]   and stuff like that.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.760]   So it's not for everyone.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.920]   It's not a universal game.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.160]   It's definitely for people who like certain types of games.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.880]   People love it.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:57.600]   They do.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.200]   And I do.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.760]   And what I want to talk about right now
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:07.120]   is that you can pre-order a Nintendo Switch, Animal Crossing,
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:11.640]   New Horizons, video game console.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.920]   And it's the cutest thing I've ever seen.
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.760]   I should get this just a punk by 17-year-old boy
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.800]   who will be so revolted.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.080]   It's pastel blue and green.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.240]   It's got a little animal.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.720]   And it has a koi-een.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.480]   Yeah, it has all these cute little--
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.880]   those are the little characters from Animal Crossing
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:31.640]   on the outside of it.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.360]   The colors are absolutely adorable.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.880]   You should see how hard it was for me to not buy this.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.560]   I already have a Nintendo Switch.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.360]   I cannot justify buying another one.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.520]   But I wanted to use so bad.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.800]   So cute.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.240]   Do you play Animal Crossing primarily on this Switch?
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.840]   This is going to be the first game to come out on Nintendo
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.240]   Switch.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.360]   I have a new leaf on my Nintendo DS,
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.760]   which I actually have not played in a very long time,
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.440]   since I got a Nintendo Switch, actually.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.120]   But I've been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.640]   on the iPhone since it came out.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.640]   And so that's been satiating my desire
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.440]   for more Animal Crossing until this game that's
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:13.480]   coming out of March 20.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.440]   Nice.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.160]   Wonderful.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.280]   I should give it a try.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:21.040]   You think this will be the best version to play?
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.040]   Not necessarily.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.160]   It's definitely got some new gaming features
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.440]   that might be appealing.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.000]   But again, I wouldn't be surprised if you
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.160]   don't like this type of game.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:31.240]   It's very low maintenance.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:31.720]   Slow.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.240]   Like that.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.360]   You go around collecting things and building little houses
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.080]   and talking to villagers.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.760]   It's very calming and relaxing.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.280]   It's a little Stardew Valley, isn't it?
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.120]   A little, yeah.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:44.720]   I don't like that.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.640]   Which is also another huge game for similar reasons.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.120]   It's just kind of this joyous life in someone else's world
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.080]   kind of experience.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.000]   I want to kill something.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:53.520]   I don't know.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.000]   It's just me.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.480]   It's not a game if I don't kill anything.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.800]   Or solve a puzzle, maybe.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.640]   No, no, I'm kidding.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.240]   Actually, that's one of the nice things about this
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.840]   is very gentle and sweet.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.760]   Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch 299,
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.040]   at your Best Buy.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.520]   Andy, not co-year pick of the week.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.360]   One quick one and an app.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.320]   I saw a really great opera at the Met
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.320]   a couple weeks ago, Agrippina.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.400]   And it's going to be on Met Broadcast
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.360]   to local theaters as a live Met and HD performance
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.840]   on Saturday, the-- on Saturday the 29th.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.520]   And I just got to say that it was a funny--
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.760]   I go to a lot of operas at the Met.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.520]   Rarely am I laughing so hard that I'm trying to stifle
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.960]   my laughter because there are a lot of crusty people around
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.280]   who are like--
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.000]   you're not supposed to laugh at people on stage doing things
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.760]   that are trying to provoke laughter.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.760]   So if you've often heard me talk about operas,
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:52.200]   I want you.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.600]   I'd like to see something someday.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.760]   You can go to a local theater.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.400]   Like tickets will cost-- it's a premium ticket.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.760]   It'll cost like $25 or $30.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.440]   They've got subtitles.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.080]   You'll be able to understand everything.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.560]   It's just funny as hell.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560]   It's-- and the performance of those--
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.280]   Oh, those performances.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.440]   --seasers were so humorous.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.440]   Yes, well, it takes part in modern day.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.400]   Basically, the story is--
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.480]   It's not a--
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.960]   It takes-- it's a 300-year-old opera.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.160]   But of course, they recast it in modern age.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.640]   So you won't have to think-- it's not people in togas
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.480]   with swords and stuff.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.040]   But-- and the performance is so good.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.160]   Joyce D'Anato, a huge, huge fan of her,
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:31.920]   did not know about Kate Lindsay, who plays Nero.
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.200]   And I liked her so much that I had it like, oh, look, she's
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:34.680]   got a CD.
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.280]   Oh, look.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.080]   And after looking to it once, it's like, yeah,
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:37.920]   I definitely got to buy that.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.280]   So like I said, if you're curious about opera,
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.640]   it's a way to do it without having
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.080]   to wait for your local city to have an opera season
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.720]   or to fly up to the Met.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.680]   But so go to metopera.org to find a local theater
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.640]   that's actually showing.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.520]   It's going to be like a 1230 PM Eastern time,
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.880]   I think, on Saturday.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.160]   But the app is a really cool list app
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.960]   that I came across for iOS.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.000]   It's called Spendstack.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.840]   And it really-- I love these apps that
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:08.440]   to focus on one thing, but prosecute that idea so thoroughly
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:13.800]   that anybody who has a need for a list that involves money
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.920]   will find a solution in this app.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.400]   And that really is all it is.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:21.760]   It's making lists that have like things that
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.480]   involve dollar amounts.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.720]   So if you are trying to get a handle on jail,
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.320]   wonder how much I spend on coffee,
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.880]   you can create a list that which you enter every time you
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:33.240]   buy coffee, how much you spent, and it'll keep a running total.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.680]   Or you can think that, here's everything
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:38.400]   that I want to buy for my office remodel.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:39.920]   And every time you come across something,
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.880]   you think you want to get put on the list, put in the dollar
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:44.880]   amount, and it will give you a running total
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.640]   and tell you what you want to do.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:51.160]   But it's how detailed they prosecuted this idea.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:54.880]   If you know that there's sales tax involved in your city,
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.200]   it will factor in sales tax.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.000]   It will factor in conversion rates for money.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.040]   Obviously, you can create labels and tags
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:05.240]   so that every time you create an entry for something,
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:08.680]   you can just say, how much am I spending on just snacks
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.760]   during my commute?
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.400]   How much am I spending on my--
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:14.400]   how am I doing on my utilities every single month?
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.560]   You can do it for budgeting.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.840]   You can do it for project management.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.720]   You can share lists through iCloud.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.880]   And it supports pretty much all the stuff
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.880]   that Apple is honking on about really great features of iOS
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.680]   that raise it above the bar.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.160]   So it's five bucks, and you own it for good.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.680]   No ads, no nothing.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.480]   And it's just such a beautifully created app
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:43.160]   that I almost want to recommend it as buy it,
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.360]   put it on your phone, and then you
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.680]   will find yourself within the next two to seven weeks,
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.880]   creating lists that are going to help you out
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.440]   because you're keeping track of money for projects
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.320]   or for just your own personal finances.
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.240]   Really, really well done stuff.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.080]   Spend stack.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.320]   And Agrippina.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.720]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:03.760]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.480]   You're a pick of the week.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:07.880]   So I am playing the role of Alex Lindsey today,
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.080]   and for that I am both sorry and non-sorry.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:10.520]   Oh, no.
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:11.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:14.400]   Alex is going to be extremely Alex Lindsey today.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.360]   So you'll just be regular Alex Lindsey today.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.680]   I'm baby Alex, like usual, like baby Yoda.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.440]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.840]   I'm putting a fall in it.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.320]   Can I just say that the idea of an Alex to an Alex?
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.120]   That is, I'm going to have to just sit back for a second.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:31.680]   It's Alex financial.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:32.680]   Oh, Alex.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.480]   Oh, Alexception.
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:38.160]   So I have a tripod, and it is not just a normal tripod.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:41.040]   This tripod, if you've ever been flummoxed or just
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.240]   frustrated by a tripod where you have to flip up
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:45.920]   a bunch of things and then lower one leg at a time
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:48.320]   and try and get it even, these, there's just one--
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:51.040]   you pull this and then you lift it up or you push it down.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.120]   You don't have to bend over.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.880]   You don't have to do anything else.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.960]   You pull all three of them up, and then you just adjust it.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.600]   And it has a little flip here.
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:01.240]   You can pull that up and you can pull the legs completely,
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.680]   180 degrees.
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:05.400]   It is so fast to set up to change.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.480]   If you shoot a lot of things and you do a lot of sets
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.120]   and you want to move between B-roll and you
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.280]   want to move between setups or you're outside
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.320]   and you want to move between different locations,
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.440]   you can buy just the legs.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:17.280]   It is expensive.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.120]   I did say it was an Alex Lindsey style pitch.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:23.000]   So the legs themselves are expensive.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.760]   The head, you can get a discount.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:28.000]   Like you can just get a Manfrotto ball head
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.040]   and then put any flow head you want to on top of that.
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.440]   They do make their own head, which is even more expensive,
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:37.080]   but it's got its own ball built in.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:41.760]   It's got a back illuminated level built into it.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:44.000]   It's just-- they've thought of so many things.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.840]   The bottoms come off quickly if you want to spike it
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.680]   into the ground.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:51.840]   It is just the fastest, easiest, most convenient tripod
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.000]   I have ever owned or used.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.400]   You pay a premium for that convenience,
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.960]   but if you are shooting a lot of stuff
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:01.320]   and you're moving around a lot and you need to do a lot of setups
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.840]   and you need to do them as fast as possible,
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.000]   it's one of those things where, again, I'm just copying Alex
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:06.920]   shamelessly here.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:09.000]   It pays for itself in terms of production time
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.040]   because production time can be so expensive.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:14.040]   I've got it a couple weeks ago and I've been super--
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:16.560]   How much do you have?
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.320]   The tripod, depending on the sales,
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:22.520]   is between 1,000 and 1,200, maybe 1,300.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.480]   The head is around 1,700.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:24.920]   Whoa.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.240]   But it's one of those things where you buy it once
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:29.080]   and you should be able to use it for like--
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:33.520]   And the worst part is that that's still just
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.920]   getting started in tripods.
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.520]   Tripods are crazy.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.920]   And this one looks amazing.
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.480]   It's so light and easy to--
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.760]   I haven't used this one.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.440]   I've seen it in places.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.000]   But I've never actually got to use it.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.240]   And it's an amazing looking tripod.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:52.560]   Renee just made Alex go whoa twice in reaction to a price.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.240]   I am impressed.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:54.920]   Well, no, no.
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.000]   That is not easy.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.160]   So I rent most of my tripods because the retail price
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.400]   on the tripods that I get, the head is $15,000.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:03.960]   And I'm like--
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:04.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.640]   I can't--
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.280]   And I can tell the difference between that head
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.600]   and a $1,000 head or $2,000 head.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:12.080]   But I'm not going to buy it.
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.040]   I would have to use it every day for years.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.800]   And that's what rental companies do.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:17.480]   As an example, this comes off slightly--
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.760]   you can just press a button and the camera comes off sideways.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.480]   You don't have to move it forward or backward,
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.360]   especially if you're against a wall or you have something
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.280]   set up in front of it.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.800]   You just peel the camera off sideways
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.480]   and it's a standard infrotop plate.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.880]   So you can slap it onto anything else, a slider, or a gimbal.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.560]   Anything you want.
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.640]   So you are paying for that.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:36.520]   You're not paying product like what a studio would use.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:38.480]   Because when you talk about this prosuar stuff,
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.840]   it's expensive for consumers.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.280]   But that it's not expensive for pros.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:41.800]   Right.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:43.080]   And it's carbon fiber.
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:44.120]   So it's really light.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:45.520]   It must be really light.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:46.720]   Yes.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.680]   That's amazing.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:51.000]   It looks like a great tripod.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.680]   I've said I've seen it--
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.280]   I would spend that much for a tripod.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.560]   I don't want it to be heavy.
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:55.960]   Oh, no.
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.120]   You've got to carry it in place.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.760]   You've got to be solved with it.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.320]   It'd still be strong.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:00.800]   It'd still be solid.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:01.120]   All right.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.160]   We've got to try a tripod.
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:03.120]   All right, I've got a tripod.
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:03.760]   You've got a tripod.
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:06.080]   My tripod is not nearly as nice as--
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.080]   Fearing this thing all around the studio,
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.120]   all through the show.
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.240]   People have been asking the chatroom, what's that?
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.840]   Alex has something special.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.320]   He's been doing here.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.280]   I don't know what-- you could put it in the camera shot.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.760]   There we go so we can kind of see it.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:21.280]   No, it's--
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.400]   It's not nearly as nice.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.840]   So just to describe it for those of you listening,
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.600]   it looks a little bit like one of those point--
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.760]   pan tilt zoom cameras.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:33.200]   It's a dome.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.280]   It's not quite on the frame.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.280]   It's got a green light.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:37.560]   It's-- come on.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.280]   You know about video ready.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.800]   You know about framing.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.200]   So now it's in front of her head.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.000]   Now move it a little more, Alex.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.760]   It's now covering Lori's face.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:47.640]   Oh, she asked for it.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.840]   She said, move it in further.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.600]   Oh, man.
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:50.800]   That's what they all say.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:53.240]   Yeah, and that's the Weinstein defense.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.560]   All right, leave it right there.
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:55.000]   Good.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:55.800]   OK.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:56.640]   Terrible.
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:57.680]   It was terrible.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.480]   I know.
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:00.960]   So it is a--
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.840]   So this is a Leica.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.880]   It's a BLK360.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.240]   So what it does is it's a mixture of a 360 scan,
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.400]   as well as a-- or a 360--
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.440]   it'll take up a 360 picture.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.000]   But it also does a laser scan.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.560]   So it's got a little mirror in there that spins,
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:22.800]   and it fires a laser out, and it captures the distance
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.960]   that everything is from this camera.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.960]   And the reason that I'm talking about it on Macbreak--
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:28.960]   I mean, it's not normally the thing I would talk about on Macbreak
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.000]   because it's a $16,000 camera.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.360]   No, that wouldn't stop you.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.080]   What are you creating?
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:34.600]   I know.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:35.440]   You know.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:36.360]   It's one of those things.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.280]   But anyway, but what it does is
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:42.880]   it works with the iPad so well.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.120]   And so of all the LiDAR scanners that I've
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.720]   had the opportunity to play with,
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:49.960]   there's a lot of ones that--
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:54.200]   this is like the entry level cost for a LiDAR scanner.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.800]   For all the ones that I've used,
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.680]   I've never seen anything just tie in.
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:01.440]   So I had to use it-- the first time I had to use it,
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:05.320]   I was like, oh, I need to spend a whole bunch of time figuring
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:06.000]   out how to use it.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.280]   Literally, you pop it up, the Wi-Fi hits your iPad,
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:15.360]   and you download what's called recap from Autodesk.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.160]   Recap talks to it, and immediately it's like, I see the scanner.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:19.880]   And so you-- and it just pops up.
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.040]   You say, I want to do a new scan.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.640]   So let's see if I can show.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.680]   Can I show that?
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:26.040]   Bring it over here.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.680]   You can get by over the shoulder shot, guys.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.840]   Right.
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.840]   Let's see if they get the shot.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:31.840]   He's pushing buttons.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.920]   There's a whole bunch of--
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:35.000]   I just threw a curve into the system.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.600]   Well, we're supposed to have the shot set up.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.680]   I don't know why we don't.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.160]   So anyway, so the--
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:40.660]   Hold on.
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:41.160]   Hold on.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.680]   Is this shot not always set up?
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.180]   OK.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:46.680]   There we go.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.760]   Oh, I guess not.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.260]   Jeez.
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:49.480]   So can you unzoom it?
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:55.240]   John doesn't normally run the board on the show.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:56.840]   That's a zone zone, doesn't it?
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.520]   OK.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.200]   It's fine.
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:59.400]   It'll work.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:02.120]   So if we look at this here, this is the image
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.240]   that it just took a couple minutes ago.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:06.240]   It's already in your iPad.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:08.040]   Well, that's the whole thing, is it just pops in.
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:09.800]   So then if I want to look at the map view,
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:11.560]   this is what-- it's doing this automatically.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.720]   These are all the points that I've already scanned.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:15.600]   You see the little black areas that I did.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:16.680]   Is it using LiDAR?
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:17.200]   What is it?
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:17.920]   It's using LiDAR.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:20.400]   So this is laser scanning the entire studio.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.040]   And I'll come in next week with an actual 3D model.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.520]   So you could have a 3D model?
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:25.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:25.960]   Because it's going to--
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:26.960]   This is just the overhead.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.880]   It doesn't show you more than this from the iPad.
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.480]   But it's got all the points.
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:31.920]   That represents all the 3D points
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:34.440]   that it's gathered from the studio.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.320]   And the fact that it is super simple.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:39.000]   Like you literally turn it on and it just
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.400]   starts scanning and doing its thing.
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:43.360]   And it grabs all that data.
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.440]   And then to start a new scan, you literally just
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:47.560]   push this button and it's going.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.240]   So it's remotely controlled.
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:51.440]   In fact, the ring on the device is--
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:52.480]   Can you show the device now?
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:53.880]   If you cut to the device, you'll see it.
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:54.720]   It's blinking the yellow.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.160]   It's blinking the other thing.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:56.000]   So it's getting ready.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.400]   It's going to start taking photos.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:58.320]   So it's open around.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.320]   Just like a LiDAR on top of an Uber.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.360]   It works a little slower with a little more accuracy.
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.600]   So the--
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.560]   Yeah, because the ones on the self-driving cars
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:08.720]   are spinning really fast.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:10.840]   This one will still be spinning, but they're moving.
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:15.760]   What they do is much harder in a lot of ways.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:16.840]   So right now, it's taking the photos.
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.120]   You can see it kind of turning and stopping.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.280]   So the thing is that what's incredible is the integration.
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:24.960]   And I think we're going to see more of this.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.640]   And this is one of the best integrations I've seen.
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.640]   Doing actual photos in addition to the LiDAR.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:30.360]   It first takes the actual photos.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.360]   Then it will--
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:32.360]   And it--
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.360]   Done.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.360]   By the way, that was pretty fast.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   And then it can use those images.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.360]   Now it's going to be something else.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:37.360]   Now it's going to start scanning.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.360]   So now you'll start seeing the little mirror spinning here.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:40.360]   So you see--
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.360]   The mirror is spinning really fast.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.280]   It's moving really slowly because it's doing one line at a time.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:48.200]   So it's bouncing light off of every object in its view.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.200]   Exactly.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:52.960]   And measuring the amount of time it takes to get back to get a three-dimensional--
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:53.960]   Beta.
[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:54.960]   Wow.
[01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:00.080]   And then-- and it's just doing one line at a time, 360,000 points a second.
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:04.480]   And so it just slowly moves all the way around.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:07.280]   And again, what's interesting about this is how--
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:12.320]   The problem with these devices before this was that they're all like, you know, goofy
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:17.200]   engineering people making stuff, making interfaces that you have to tap and do weird stuff to
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.680]   and everything else.
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:24.040]   And what we see here is a professional piece of hardware that's being completely run from
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:25.040]   an iPad.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.440]   And the setup is nothing to do it.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:35.640]   And this isn't super high-end LiDAR, but for the use case that I'm using it for is--
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.520]   And I'm borrowing this from another friend.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:39.920]   It's $18,000 and it's not super high-end?
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.920]   No, no.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.480]   It's a little noisy.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.480]   But the--
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:47.720]   Well, on the bright side, you get a one-year subscription for Autodesh Recap Pro.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.920]   Well, but the main thing is that I don't want to oversell it because I've used a bunch
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.440]   of scanners that are, you know, $60,000 scanners and $80,000 scanners that are really high--
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:02.560]   You know, really-- but I would use this all the time for site surveys for-- I got to
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:03.920]   model this room for something.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.920]   I got to go out.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:07.240]   It's great for-- I got to get the data.
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.240]   And when I say rough, it's plus or minus 6 millimeters.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.760]   So it's the accuracy is--
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:12.760]   That's pretty good.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:13.760]   You know, it's--
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.760]   So how would you use this?
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.160]   What would you use this for?
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:22.280]   I'm doing a video shoot somewhere in San Francisco next month.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.560]   And I said, hey, can I just come down and measure the room?
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:25.560]   And they're like, sure.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:27.560]   And I said, I'm going to bring a laser measure.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.560]   Yeah.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.960]   They thought you were going to have some--
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:31.640]   They thought I was going to bring down one of those little things--
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:32.640]   Yeah, at the point.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:34.440]   --and you pointed the wall and I just brought down a laser measure.
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.600]   You know, and then-- and so I took five or six scans like they did in this office.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.840]   So literally in half an hour, you could get a very, very detailed--
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:42.840]   I have everything.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:43.840]   You know, I have--
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.840]   And by the way, I mentioned there's people moving around and stuff and you don't care about it.
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.480]   It'll throw that-- you know, you'll have some bad pixels here and there, but it doesn't
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:49.480]   matter for the overall.
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:50.480]   So now what--
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.480]   It's looking at the static stuff.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:55.160]   Now what happens is when we're planning, I'm no longer going-- I don't remember what--
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.160]   I didn't measure that.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.160]   I should have measured that distance between the poles.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.840]   I just go back to the document and measure it.
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:02.400]   So I can re-measure anything.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.480]   And what I'm going to do is build a model and sketch up of that room so that I can now--
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:11.200]   And especially if I'm going-- when you're figuring out all this lighting, for instance,
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:15.880]   if I wanted to figure out how to attach something complex to this lighting-- I won't, I promise--
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.960]   But if I want to do something complex, now I have all that data, I can just sit there
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:22.200]   and plan it out on my computer and come in.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.680]   I can print 3D objects that are going to-- 3D clamps or do whatever I want that's going
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.320]   to be perfect for that.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.320]   That's really cool.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:32.040]   Now they also use it for things like forensics.
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.720]   So you go into a crime scene and you just throw this guy out and go around and it just
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.920]   gathers the whole crime scene.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.720]   And that's going to let you go back and look at the distances.
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.680]   You can imagine a car accident, where were the cars actually and what's there?
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:46.520]   So police departments might be using this.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.680]   Yeah, so it's actually really interesting.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:53.000]   And what's kept it out was A, the expense, which again $18,000 is a lot of money but
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.440]   it's not for this kind of-- I'm sure a surveyors rig costs something like that.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.640]   I mean this is not-- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:04.280]   And so for gathering this data and what was really a problematic was A, the expense and
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:05.720]   B, the complexity of it.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.520]   And what they've taken away with this iPad is the complexity.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:15.960]   You know, it's really a relatively simple-- Could I make a Minecraft level of our studio
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:16.960]   using this?
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:17.960]   Oh yeah.
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:26.080]   I was just thinking, I wonder, can we use your 3D model to use a 3D printer to build a physical
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.080]   model of the studio?
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.080]   Well, yeah.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:29.080]   Because that would be really cool.
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:32.000]   We could definitely print a version of it.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.560]   You know, I think that what I would typically do is use a mixture-- if I was going to print
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:39.280]   something with color and everything else, we could definitely do it.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:42.760]   But I would add photogrammetry to it to add more texture detail.
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:45.480]   More importantly, could we use this to plan a heist?
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.680]   I think George Clooney already has.
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:50.680]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:51.920]   Yes, you could absolutely do that.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:56.080]   I would never-- Of course, I would not recommend it for heisting.
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:57.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.080]   But it would help to fray the cost.
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:03.400]   It would take a lot easier to pre-vis the length of the cable and all those things are
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.280]   much easier when you have pretty data.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:11.480]   So follow-up question, could it be hidden inside, say, like a comically large top pad?
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:17.600]   No, if you're moving, you would need flashlight R for that, which you could get.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:22.600]   But it would not-- you'd be better off with just doing photogrammetry at that point.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:30.080]   You see, you thought, Renee Richie, oh, this $1,000 tripod, it's really going to set Alex
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.280]   Lindsey back on his heels, but no.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.280]   Oh, no, I had no such delusion.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.280]   That was baby Alex.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.800]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:45.160]   The Leica BLK360 LIDAR imaging laser scanner.
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:46.320]   Get two.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.720]   That way you save time.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:51.880]   But again, the reason I brought it up was mostly to talk about the fact that more manufacturers
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:55.960]   should think about this idea of connecting to the iOS apps and let this be the interface.
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:56.960]   Love that.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]   Let it be the interface.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.760]   Stop trying-- like literally, there's no interface.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.760]   Why is it on the other?
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:01.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:02.760]   Stop.
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.760]   Just stop.
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:07.360]   Don't even put an LCD on your machine because what you build on your own with your development
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:10.640]   team is not anything near what an iOS device can do.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:14.480]   And you should just let-- this is a great example of-- we just gave up.
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:17.320]   We reduced the cost.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:18.440]   It reduced the development cost.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.920]   It reduced the production cost.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.040]   And it gave a better product.
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:23.280]   And that's why I wanted to show it.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.280]   Nice.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.760]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:29.720]   Alex is at 090.media.
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:35.920]   And if you want to have a LIDAR scanner, your next event, I would contact him there or on
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:42.120]   the Twitter @AlexLindsayALEXLIND, S-A-Y.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.480]   Lori Gill, managing editor at IMOR.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:48.840]   She's the greatest alcoholic on the Twitter, APPA, H-O-L-I-K.
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:50.960]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.640]   What are you working on?
[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:54.600]   No, just go to IMOR.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:55.600]   Read all of our stuff.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.280]   We're having a really good time over there.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:00.320]   Again and again, turn off the ad blocker as I have.
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.400]   Enjoy the ads.
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:02.400]   They're delicious.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:07.400]   Enjoy the Embrace ads.
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:09.400]   Sign up for Passport and you see about 10% of those ads.
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:10.400]   That's nice.
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:15.160]   If you sign in to our website, that reduces the amount of ads you see significantly.
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.160]   Beautiful.
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:17.160]   That's a good tip.
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:25.320]   IMOR.com/vector will take you to Renee Richie's fabulous theater where he puts on shows daily
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:28.080]   all kinds of stuff.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.320]   How's the Pokemon go going?
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:30.800]   Are you staying inside?
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.360]   What are you going to get out there?
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:33.960]   I haven't done the battle leagues yet.
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:36.960]   They introduced this whole thing and I just haven't done that yet.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.480]   I have been doing all the other events and things but it was so buggy in the beginning
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:43.960]   and now they've already moved between great and battle leagues.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:47.360]   I haven't gotten to the PvP stuff yet, Leo, but otherwise it's going fine.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:48.360]   Very nice.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.080]   I got my shiny rhinoceros this one.
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:52.160]   That's what really counts.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:55.480]   I was lick-a-tongue hunting just the other day.
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:56.480]   Nice.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:00.720]   Did you ever think that you would say that?
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.720]   No.
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.000]   In fact that sentence has never come out of my mouth ever before.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.720]   Mr. Andy Enoco, he's with...
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:07.720]   Oh, I just touched my face.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.200]   Oh no, I'm going to die.
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.840]   He's with the beautiful WGBH in Boston.
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.360]   When's your next appearance at the Boston Public Library?
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:17.080]   Thursday and it will indeed be at the Boston Public Library.
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.560]   So come on down and get a cookie, get a cup of coffee.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:22.640]   We'll have to pay for both but you get to watch a pretty good show.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:23.640]   Nice.
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:24.640]   Check out my Twitter.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:25.640]   I don't know what time you are.
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:26.640]   I think like 11.30.
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:27.880]   It could be wrong though.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.520]   I usually, I will tweet out in the morning or the afternoon before.
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:36.400]   He's I-H-N-A-T-K-O on the Twitter.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.600]   We love doing MacBrick Weekly.
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:42.600]   It's kind of part of Apple Morning around here.
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:46.680]   We start with iOS today at 9am Pacific and then MacBrick Weekly follows shortly thereafter.
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:49.440]   Usually around 11, 11.30am Pacific.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:54.040]   That would be 2am Eastern time or 1700 UTC.
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:56.880]   You can watch it or listen to it live at twitter.tv/live.
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:57.880]   You can be in studio too.
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:01.080]   We had a great studio audience including from Boyk Software.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.080]   Oliver was here.
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:06.720]   Nice to see you Oliver.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:11.320]   He's brought some people with the public broadcasting.
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:13.320]   He's got the mobile broadcast unit.
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:14.320]   Did you see that?
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:15.320]   It's amazing.
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.320]   That mobile broadcast unit?
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:17.320]   Wow.
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.560]   Really cool.
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.840]   That uses your Minio.
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:20.840]   What is it called?
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:21.840]   Mimeo.
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:22.840]   Mimo Live.
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:25.920]   The Mimo Live software.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:29.160]   You can find out more at boinx.com.
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:31.840]   Thank you Oliver and everybody in our studio audience.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.640]   Great to have you all.
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:35.680]   All you have to do is email tickets at twitter.tv.
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:38.080]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.080]   Let's see what else.
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:41.520]   If you want to get the show on demand, I know you've got a busy life.
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:44.480]   You can get a copy anytime you want at our website.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:49.920]   twitter.tv/mbw or and this is my recommendation.
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.920]   My pro tips.
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:52.640]   Subscribe and your favorite podcast app.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:55.440]   That way it just downloads automatically every week and you don't have to worry about
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:57.560]   what time, what day or any of that stuff.
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:59.360]   You just listen to Mac break weekly.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:00.360]   Thanks for being here.
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:04.800]   Now I have to say it's time to get back to work because great time is over.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.320]   Bye bye.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:17.560]   [MUSIC]
