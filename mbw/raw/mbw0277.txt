[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.760]   And here he is.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.440]   I don't know why I'm talking from Scotland.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.160]   I just back from Paris, and it shouldn't sound like this.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.760]   Mr. Andy Enochko from Beautiful Baston,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.000]   where the sun is shining, and the superheroes are out.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.640]   Yes, we're featuring the Just Ice League,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.880]   a part of the reboot at DC Universe.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.120]   They only respond to threats above the Arctic Circle.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.000]   And life is calm.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.360]   You just ice-league.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.120]   Started off as a typo at DC editorial.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.200]   They decided, you know what?
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.560]   Jim Lee did a great drawing of this concept.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.240]   Let's just go with it.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.400]   The Just Ice League.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.440]   They're all about new ideas at DC.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.880]   I finally got it.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.240]   There you go.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.840]   Good to see you.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.040]   I've been here in-- I don't know how long.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.840]   Thank you for that.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840]   Yes, you hold that off.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.360]   You've been off for?
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.880]   Yes, I agree.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.720]   Actually, I think they say "gala-vonting."
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.800]   Oh, there you go.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.000]   You can travel has broadened you.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.120]   Broaden me in more ways than what I'll talk about that later.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840]   And also here from Japan, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.200]   where he has 59 megabits up.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.160]   Don't even ask about the down, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   I'm thinking of backing up the internet while I'm here.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.000]   I brought a couple of extra drives.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.920]   And I should take some time in this morning to finish it off.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.960]   Now, that's hotel internet.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.200]   Is that typical, you think, for everybody?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   It actually is.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520]   I mean, a lot of-- I don't know if it's typical for everyone
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.320]   in Japan, but in the hotels, it's pretty common to get 10, 20
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.680]   megabits.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.920]   This is actually really good.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.960]   And I think it's a little bit better because it's four
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.720]   o'clock in the morning.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.240]   Oh, my god.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.600]   So you have the entire pipe for the hotel.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.040]   We better get the show over before everybody gets up at 6.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.960]   It's 4 a.m.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.120]   Alex, thank you for getting up to be here.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.760]   It's my pleasure.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.720]   I missed you guys.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.160]   And I missed the ukulele.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.440]   I missed all the other pieces.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.800]   And I actually--
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.360]   It's Wednesday.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.080]   So it's--
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.200]   So it just occurred to me.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.480]   We better make sure we finish the show before all those lonely
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.560]   Japanese businessmen wake up and start downloading games.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.600]   I went something for my pillow girlfriend.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.120]   What are you doing in the land of the rising sun, Mr. Lindsey?
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.920]   We're manning a couple days of streaming for salesforce.com.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.040]   So they're doing cloud force Japan.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.760]   So we've got a crew here.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.800]   And I'm one of many.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.040]   Did you ship everything all the gear out, or did they have to--
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.760]   Half a ton.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.440]   Holy check.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.640]   You checked it.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.200]   You ought to see the looks on United Airlines.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.840]   When we show up with literally its 12, Pelican cases.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.960]   You saw the-- you've seen the Pelican cases.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.880]   I have.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.960]   Office.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   So there's 12 of those.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   And they're big and they're heavy.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.520]   And they're all 69 pounds.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.800]   And we actually have the weights taped on to them in the front.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.640]   And so if you're a Starlines gold,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.200]   you can take up to three bags per person on the same ticket.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.840]   So if you bring four people, you get 12 bags and 70 pounds for free.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.160]   Did you pay for overages?
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.880]   So the guys had to pay for Japan.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.200]   It got a little painful.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.480]   When we went to New York and we did it a couple weeks ago,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.000]   and we actually paid for the weight.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.280]   You don't pay for the extra-- we didn't pay for extra bags
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.240]   because we had up to 12 bags for free.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   But we did pay for the weight.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.920]   And the weight was about $800 charged, which is--
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.400]   seems like a lot, but it's not much when you consider that it's--
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   literally, when I say it's a half a ton,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.440]   I mean, it was 1,100 pounds of stuff that we checked.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.280]   And that's cameras, a switcher, a streaming gear.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.080]   A whole couple of them.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.160]   And the entire television streaming studio.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.720]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.880]   Wow.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.040]   So anyway, so you get used to it after a while.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.080]   It's just that you get picky about the carts.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   So there's like-- we don't like the ones in Tokyo
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.920]   because in the Rita, they have these little lips on the front,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.200]   which means all of our bags are all tilted the wrong way.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.120]   So you become a connoisseur of airport carts.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.120]   The lips are tilted the wrong way.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.560]   Well, probably they never thought about that, did they?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.920]   Children.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.760]   We can't have a show title this early.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.080]   We're just marking that.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.920]   That's all we're doing.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.840]   Just marking it, just saying--
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.960]   Lips are pointed the wrong way.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.440]   If it could-- if nothing else occurs--
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.160]   --at 3-2 Alex Lindsay.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.560]   In Japan, the lips are all pointed the wrong way.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.760]   I think that is a show title I hate to say.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.920]   And I don't see anything better coming along.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.160]   So this is the show if you're just tuned in.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.800]   It's a little discursive beginning
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.760]   because I haven't been hearing them just getting caught up.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.920]   This is the show where we cover Macintosh stuff and Apple
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.800]   stuff isn't a whole hell of a lot to talk about this week.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's hard to do shows like this news shows in December
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.040]   because really everybody's gone home at Apple.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.640]   Everybody's gone.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.160]   Everybody's out of this.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.480]   But we'll find some things to talk about today.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   Anyway, I missed you guys.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.880]   Thank you for doing the show without me last week.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.720]   Was did Andy host the show last week?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520]   Thank you.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.040]   Thank you.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.720]   And who produced it on?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.760]   Because Eileen was in Paris with us.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.040]   Did you do the work?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.840]   Andy did the work of the content.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   Thank you.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.000]   And Colin ran the board and Nicole prompt him to do the ads.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.920]   We've got a deep bench.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   Thank you.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.000]   It only made me appreciate how difficult Eileen's job
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   and Leo's job is.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.840]   Eileen mostly.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.240]   I just sit here.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   I just sit here.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.640]   All right.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.000]   I'm going to start off with it's kind of not really an Apple
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   story.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.040]   And I just put it in.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   You guys haven't seen it yet.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.480]   But the chat room brought it up.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.560]   And I think it's a good idea to mention this.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.600]   The US government's transportation safety experts
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.560]   recommended today to ban all American drivers
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   from using portable electronic devices, including cell phones,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.920]   even if you use a hands-free device.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.560]   What the crap?
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   What the hell?
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.040]   You could still use GPS navigation devices.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.480]   And in an emergency, you could use your cell phone.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.320]   The NTSB also urged consumer electronics manufacturers
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.120]   to figure out a way to disable the functions
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.400]   of all portable electronic devices within reach
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.760]   of the driver when the vehicle is in motion.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.360]   Excellent plan.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.000]   Just die when the GPS--
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.480]   They should also find a way to disable the air conditioning
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.760]   controls, the heating controls, the windshield
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.000]   vapor controls, and everything else
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.160]   that causes you to take your eyes off the road for less than a second
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.080]   to simply turn on deactivate or adjust the device.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.400]   Why didn't they ban cassettes?
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   Real hard thinking.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.600]   That was the killer.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.840]   You drop a cassette on the floor, you bend down,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.160]   to get it, you stick it in the thing,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.880]   and meanwhile, your car is plowed into the side of the road.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.320]   I think that's the killer.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.960]   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.680]   says distracted driving killed 3,000 people in 2010.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.800]   How many automotive deaths were there in 2010, more than 55,000?
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.200]   3,000 of them were caused by cell phones.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.680]   We're not even that distracted driving.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.840]   Well, distracted driving.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.920]   That's a catch-all category, isn't it?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.400]   Yeah, that could be the cassette.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.600]   Well, I think that they really ought to ban radios.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.360]   If they're going to go this far, they really want to get--
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.440]   I think that's the-- and makeup.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   Women may not wear makeup.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.000]   And drive-throughs.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   Oh, no more eating.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.600]   I saw a statistic-- something like 75% of everybody
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.320]   eats in the car.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   And I'll tell you what.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.240]   I had a double, double in and out, double, double protein
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.600]   style yesterday.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.360]   There's no bun.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.080]   It's just lettuce.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.840]   It is not easy.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   Your hands get so slippery, you can't actually steer.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.840]   Because the wheel just-- in your hands.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.080]   So I don't recommend that.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.520]   We should ban that too.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   So what do you think, guys?
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.200]   I mean, I think there's no question.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.680]   It's dangerous to text while you drive.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.040]   Right.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.280]   So it's like-- if people are actually
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.440]   distracted by their device while driving,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.360]   there are certainly ways to control that.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840]   Unfortunately, the best way to do it
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.720]   is to simply make the-- just like drunk driving,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.320]   you can't really put a breathalyzer on every single car
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   that ships to make sure you cannot step into the car
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   while you're drunk.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.960]   But you can make sure that if you were ever caught drunk
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.200]   driving, the penalties are so severe
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.680]   that it'll put the fear of God into you.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.440]   But they are.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.360]   It's expensive.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.640]   And the things that really are truly distracting,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.840]   like I think we can all agree that even with voice to text,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.600]   you cannot text while driving.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.560]   You cannot do it.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.600]   I don't think you can even really have an extended conversation
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.680]   on the phone through a Bluetooth handset while driving
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.040]   not be affected somehow.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.840]   But all those things leave digital breadcrumbs
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.640]   with a phone company.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.520]   So if there is an accident, anybody can simply subpoena
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.480]   those records and find out that you know what?
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.240]   While you were on the highway, you were not
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.320]   stopped at a traffic light.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.520]   There's no chance of you saying you texted while you're
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.840]   in a safe condition.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.120]   I don't think that you should punish people for simply reaching
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.240]   out without even looking at the iPhone, tapping this big red
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.680]   button that says, play, pause, or next track to skip over
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.480]   that one almond brother song you don't like that found its way
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.680]   onto your iTunes library when it's on shuffle play.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.240]   That's not distracted driving.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.000]   Just like I don't see why they're saying that it's distracted
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.280]   driving when you're operating a phone.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.840]   But it's not distracted driving when your eyes are off the road
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.880]   for a second and a half.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.320]   Why are you trying to get the temperature of the car
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.240]   or just the way you like it?
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.480]   It's nuts.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.840]   And my father's a lawyer.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.400]   And he said that when you have a car accident,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.680]   the very first thing you do is subpoena the phone records.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.000]   I mean, it's just like that's just like gathering the information.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.560]   You know, like check the skid mark, you know,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.840]   like the skid marks on the road and see what
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.040]   get the pictures of the cars and subpoena the cell phone
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.360]   records because that's going to be, you know,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.720]   a very high percentage of them are going to be connected.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.520]   I should point out that it is legal to smoke a cigarette
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.280]   while you're driving, distracting you, potentially
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.480]   killing yourself and others.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.080]   They're not talking about panning cigarettes while driving.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.880]   35 state.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.920]   And by the way, nobody's contesting
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.080]   it shouldn't be legal to text while you drive.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.360]   That's not what this law says.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.000]   This law says you shouldn't even be able to have a Bluetooth.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.600]   You shouldn't be able to have a Bluetooth car phone.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.520]   You shouldn't be able to talk on the cell phone at all
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.360]   while you're driving.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.320]   That's what they're saying.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.480]   So that would ban, you know, having, I get in the car,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.840]   my phone is automatically hooked up to my Ford Sync
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.640]   and I could press a button and I could talk, that's banned.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.280]   I could answer the phone.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.560]   That's banned.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.400]   35 states ban texting while driving.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.760]   I mean, nobody could test that.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.600]   But that's why I like the blanket term distracted driving
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.040]   because there are all kinds of ways to improperly
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.680]   operate your vehicle and not be focused on the job of driving.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.280]   I just don't think that you should simply say that any time
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.320]   you reach over and tap a button on your phone,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.400]   you are distracted.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.320]   Again, unless they're willing to ship cars about any single
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   buttons of any kind on the dashboard,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.480]   they just can't make that argument and say that they're
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.920]   doing something that's logical.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.920]   Maybe this is all a plot by Google to get autonomous
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.080]   vehicles into federal law.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.840]   I'm willing to go for that.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.000]   Well, I don't know what anyone would do in LA if they took
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.920]   their phone.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.200]   When you sit on the 405, there is a, like I couldn't
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.840]   understand why everybody I work with in LA would call me
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.760]   all the time and never email me.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.360]   And I finally realized that when I'm in LA, you're on the
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.760]   405 and you're moving 10 miles an hour for the next
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.560]   hour and a half.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.120]   That's all you can do.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.640]   Exactly.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.680]   And you got to get worked in.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.760]   I'll never forget taking a drive with Steve Vikers,
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.000]   a salesman at KFI.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.840]   And he puts his blackberry in the thing.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.520]   And it's an hour to get anywhere in LA, always.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.080]   And he maybe 40 sales calls.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.360]   He's on the drive and down the highway.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.640]   And I never felt at risk.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.800]   I think Steve was a good driver.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.600]   He's paying attention.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.680]   Anyway, I don't know what to make of this.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.600]   I think the chances of Congress passing a law against this,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.040]   especially in election year, is next to none.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.400]   But I just thought I should bring this up.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.640]   And you can't really fault the NTSB.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.320]   Their job is to say, here's what causes accidents.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.720]   We think this causes 3,000 people died last year, so you
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.880]   should ban it.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.800]   But again, that's a tiny fraction of the number of people
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.200]   who die in auto accidents every year.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.360]   I don't know what the--
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.760]   I should see-- auto accident deaths.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.920]   Point, interview.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.880]   Safe search on, please.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   Auto accident deaths in the US in 2010.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.120]   Let's see if they can--
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.880]   Google, tell me.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.120]   See if the Google can find that.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.080]   This looks like a job for Siri.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.520]   Siri, actually, I wonder if maybe Siri would be faster.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.760]   Let's see.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   Siri, how many people died as a public public?
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   I've got to go ahead and have it.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   I have it.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.840]   I always-- let's see.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.000]   US ranks fourth in automobile accidents.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.120]   I'm sorry, Siri.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   I'm done with you now.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.440]   Thank you.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.960]   Go away.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.520]   By the way, Siri doesn't work so good in France.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.040]   I just want to point that out.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.720]   I tried it with a French accent and all kinds of things.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.160]   This is weird.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   Wolfum Alpha rupees Pons with a complete summary of this question,
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.400]   data not available.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.600]   Oh.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.240]   How could that not be available?
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   It seems like-- yeah, I don't know
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   how that turns into a not a-- I'm sorry.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.680]   We'd like to search the web for that.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.280]   It turns out to-- I have an answer for you.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.840]   The answer to that is--
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.400]   I don't know if your guess is as good as mine.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   Toad Sloth has-- I think has it nailed in the chat room.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   He says stupidity causes accidents,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.280]   but you're not banning stupidity, are you?
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.560]   According to the World Health Organization,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.880]   45,000 people died in automobile accidents in 2002.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.520]   That's a fourth in that category.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.840]   You know why China had a quarter of a million automobile
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.240]   deaths in 2002?
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.320]   Holy cow.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.280]   I don't feel so bad now.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.720]   Holy cow.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.840]   I don't know what the-- this is nine years ago.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.200]   That's the closest stat I can find.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.800]   But I don't think nine years ago a whole lot of people
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.720]   in China had cars, so a quarter of a million people dying
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.640]   in China in all accidents.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.720]   That's like almost everybody who had a car.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   And they've been driving for less than 18 months.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.640]   I'm not going to make any jokes about Chinese drivers,
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.480]   I promise.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.880]   But that's India, 199,000, and then Indonesia, 51,000,
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.720]   and then the US for 45.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.600]   45 is down a lot, because the last time I looked,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.200]   it was 55,000 a year.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.960]   And that was probably pre-2002, because I don't check that stat
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.480]   in line.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   Enough.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.720]   Just thought I'd bring it up.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.960]   I just a chance for us to get a little irate,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.400]   a little hot under the collar.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.280]   We're going to continue on, talk about iOS.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.240]   It's a little--
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.480]   both you and Alex are back after a layoff.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.240]   This is sort of like an amuse-bouche.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.080]   That's it.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.920]   Precisely.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.880]   Set the palette for the rich protein-filled milliliter.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.840]   You go to McDonald's.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.600]   They give you an amuse-bouche in Paris.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.240]   I mean, it's like everywhere you go,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.520]   you don't start a meal without an amuse-bouche,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.680]   which means I guess--
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.240]   It looks like a French fry, but it's actually
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.720]   amorized peas on a bed of ketchup foam.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.680]   Exactly.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.280]   Very intermolecular gastronomy.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.000]   That hasn't made its way to the west coast yet,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.440]   but on the east coast, it's all molecular gastronomy
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.480]   at the McDonald's drive-through.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.680]   I saw-- I looked at McDonald's and Paris
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.960]   at a big Senate side that said, the French hamburger.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   I mean, that's like--
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.200]   I guess that's why you go to McDonald's
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   if you're in Paris.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.040]   We couldn't figure it out.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Why would you go to McDonald's?
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.560]   Because you want an American French hamburger.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.080]   It's funny you see it.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.200]   But McDonald's is a fascinating place.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.360]   In all-- every country has its own little--
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.920]   McDonald's kind of morphs.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.240]   Here in Japan, I haven't ever eaten in McDonald's in Japan,
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.200]   but you walk by and look at the menus.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.440]   And they have all kinds of more Japanese fare.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.320]   And it's tempting to go in and just try that.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.600]   But then there's a ramen shop next door.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   You realize that you're in Japan.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.880]   It's actual food.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.720]   Yes.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.200]   The greatest Dunkin-- I would almost go back to Korea
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.440]   just for the Dunkin Donuts, like local variety of donuts
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.320]   they have in Korea.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.440]   You see like the--
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.800]   You see like the donuts.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.000]   Well, no, it's a regular Dunkin Donuts.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.520]   Like, if there's all the same signage,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.880]   all the same like little wire bins,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.800]   all the white-- the pink paper.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.480]   And then you see this heart-shaped donut
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.760]   that's filled with red bean curd.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   And you say, well, ha, ha, ha.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.960]   I mean, it's filled with beans.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.560]   I'm like, oh my god, this is like the tastiest donut I have ever had.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   I'll share the pictures.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.200]   There's some of the best pictures from that trip
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.640]   where it just-- oh my god, the airport donut shop
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.800]   is really awesome.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   I am going to--
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.960]   I'm checking the first grid here right away.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.600]   At the risk of continuing this completely off-purpose
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.160]   conversation, I went to have a Big Mac in Beijing.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.000]   And I've had a Big Mac in France.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.840]   The Big Mac in France, they call it the royal,
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.720]   has some weird sauce on it that is not American.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   OK.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.520]   I don't know what it is, but it ain't Big Mac sauce.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.480]   In Beijing, it's precisely exactly the same.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.440]   I think there's a commitment in China to quality.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.520]   And the French are not going to-- they said, no, this is not
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.200]   how we are going to make it.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.080]   You could take your Big Mac sauce and put it
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.480]   well, this one don't shine.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.280]   And no, they do not have chipotle's.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.560]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.080]   Come back.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.000]   Alex Lindsey is here.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.880]   We have actual Mac news.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.520]   Alex Lindsey is here from Japan.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.280]   Can you try?
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.440]   Can you chua?
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.080]   Where he's going to have a kimchi flavored donut in the moment?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.920]   From Baston, where the sun is shining bright.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.680]   Today's the day.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.960]   It's a good day, beautiful day, Mr. Andy Naco.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.840]   And I am Leo LaPorte, and we will have more in just a moment.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.600]   But first, I've got to tell you, as both Eileen and I start to go--
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.920]   I know, I'm sorry.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.760]   I'm trying.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.600]   We got the luweb, the luweb cold.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.520]   We got the cold.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.920]   The cold.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.200]   That's actually what they're calling.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.720]   No, they call it la greepe.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.280]   La greepe.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.200]   La greepe.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.240]   We have la greepe.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.200]   But it's that time of year.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.320]   It's the most cold time of year you're traveling.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.400]   Things can keep you out of the office like la greepe.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.080]   But what?
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.520]   Everyone on the plane was sick.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.040]   No, it's just that time of year.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.120]   I don't feel too bad.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.600]   I actually feel--
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.200]   No, I'm not that bad either.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.040]   I'm fine.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.360]   Because our American antibodies are a match for any French cold.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.880]   They're just going to fight it off.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.600]   It was just uncomfortable on landing for me.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.720]   Did your ears--
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.040]   It was the sinuses they heard.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.680]   La greepe.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.280]   La greepe, they call this luweb.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:24.800]   You say that.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.400]   It actually feels like you have a cold.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.680]   La greepe.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.840]   Anyway, all of this to say that the bad weather,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.600]   the bugs, the holidays can really
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.640]   keep you from going to work.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.200]   It doesn't mean you can't get work done.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.440]   Thanks to go to meeting.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.320]   It is hard to hold meetings this time of year.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.280]   People just aren't around.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.400]   But it's hard every day because people
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.120]   will travel.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.440]   Alex is in Japan.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.400]   Andy's in Boston.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.840]   I'm here in Northern California.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.120]   That's why when we need to have meetings,
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.080]   we use go to meeting.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.800]   And I totally recommend go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.680]   You can host a meeting from your computer, Mac or PC.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.000]   Should you be foolishly using a Windows machine?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.600]   And your attendees can join from anything,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.240]   including an iPad, an iPhone, an Android phone.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.360]   They can download the free go to meeting app.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.400]   And they're in the meeting.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.920]   HD faces means they can see you in beautiful, full, high def
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.960]   video.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.120]   It's just fantastic.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.240]   And if you got a cold, just to point the camera out the window,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.800]   let them enjoy the beautiful scenery where you are.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.440]   It's that good.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.560]   Go to meeting.com.

[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.040]   And then say Macbreak is the offer code 30 days free.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.000]   And I think you're going to love this thing.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.320]   It is awesome.

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.120]   they've really got it down.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.360]   Oh, my web is slow today.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.040]   I don't know why.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.240]   Maybe it has a lot of grip as well.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.800]   Try it today.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.720]   So let me look and see.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.880]   There is a little Mac news.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.160]   The FCC is reviewing AT&T's spectrum purchase.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.040]   This is such an obstrue's topic.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.560]   And yet I think it's very important to address.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.320]   FCC has restarted the clock, which
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.120]   means it has now 180 days, six months, to review this.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.240]   So it's going to be a while before this happens.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.400]   AT&T attempting to buy a ton of spectrum
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.480]   for its LTE implementation.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.320]   Doesn't matter to iPhone users because we don't have LTE.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.000]   But it doesn't make you wonder if we're
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.720]   going to see an LTE iPhone come whenever June.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.000]   First of all, Andy, do you think they'll
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   get back on schedule or is September the new iPhone launch
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   day?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.440]   I think they're really waiting for 4G.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.480]   I think that's going to be the killer feature.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.080]   And I think that it's worth holding off a delay release
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.880]   until then.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.440]   It certainly looks like AT&T is not
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.040]   going to have that sort of US penetration for 4G
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.240]   by certainly not until the summer at the earliest.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.840]   So it's not that they've established a precedent
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.280]   that they've broken themselves that useless idea that every summer
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.200]   there has to be a brand new iPhone.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.160]   Now they are certainly more available as an option in September.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.440]   It's the same reason why--
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.360]   one of the reasons why they decided
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.120]   to stop doing keynotes every January at Macworld Expo
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.560]   because it was a totally artificial deadline
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.440]   to have something interesting to announce.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.240]   So I think that we're sort of broken
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.800]   from the entire release schedule.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.440]   I'm not even so sure that we'll see an iPad announcement
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.440]   in the first couple of months of 2012 either.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.320]   There's another advantage to not having a schedule.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.440]   If you have a schedule, then for the three months
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.240]   before the release date, you're not going to sell me.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.000]   So a lot of people, I think, are saying,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.560]   oh, I'm going to hold off on the 4S
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.440]   because the 5 is going to come out in June.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.080]   Well, maybe you shouldn't.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.240]   You agree, Alex?
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.120]   Yeah, I actually think that keeping people guessing
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.720]   is important because I know a lot of us
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.480]   get into a mode where we have some sense of when
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.040]   the next phone's coming out and everyone just
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.200]   or the next computer.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.640]   I mean, they talked about the fact that the Mac Pro, for instance,
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.480]   isn't selling very well.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.760]   That's because all of us are certain or--
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.480]   Right.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.320]   --these wishfully hoping that we're
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.240]   going to see a Thunderbolt-enabled Mac Pro.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.040]   So no one's buying one.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.480]   And we're trying to hang on to these
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.000]   as long as we possibly can.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.760]   And I think that that happens with all their product lines.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.960]   That's an interesting point.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.160]   So being tied to that schedule is really a terrible idea.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.280]   So why not mess with it?
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.080]   Fool around.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.120]   Keep people guessing.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.080]   I think it's good.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.400]   I think that the challenge, of course,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.720]   is that you do have a production schedule, too.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.920]   So that's the other side of it, is
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.240]   that there is a certain churn to things.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.720]   But I think that definitely rotating.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.280]   And I think we're seeing Apple start to experiment with when
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.320]   things are released.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.800]   We're not going to get them all in the same month every year.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.400]   It is pretty clear that the iPhone 5 has been tested,
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.200]   has been prototyped, has kind of could have been even announced
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.560]   maybe this year.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.920]   But I think Andy, you're right.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.560]   The only reason for an iPhone 5 is LTE.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.000]   Yeah, they've-- Apple's shown no interest in larger screens.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   They've shown no interest in all the other basic features
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.040]   that keep rolling out on Android phones that
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.120]   seem to differentiate one model from another.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.360]   So I think that they're--
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   I don't think we'll see something called the iPhone 5
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.480]   until they're confident that 4G is going
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.360]   to be available to most of the iPhone users out there.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.200]   All right.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.840]   Well, there you go.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.280]   And I think that this is pretty clear because the FCC
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.600]   has given itself another six months to review the--
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.680]   this is 700 megahertz spectrum that Qualcomm held.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:53.960]   I don't know.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.680]   What were they using?
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.760]   Was that for their-- that silly TV thing that Qualcomm did
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.200]   that flopped?
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.960]   I can't remember what they were using that for.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.360]   But at any event, AT&T wants it.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   And FCC says maybe in six months, which means I think we
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.480]   don't see an iPhone in June.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.600]   But that's just my thought.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   Of course, it's not just AT&T.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   It's Sprint and Verizon, too.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.400]   Verizon's moving pretty quickly to get their LTE out.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.040]   Right.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.760]   Verizon is great.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.960]   If you want 4G, if you go for Verizon,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.360]   you're not going to be unhappy with it.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.200]   But Apple always wants to make sure
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.360]   that there's a consistent iPhone experience, at least
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.080]   within each individual country.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.880]   Another question, though, is kind of interesting,
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.480]   is would Apple even consider a skip year
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.880]   for a major model upgrade?
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.000]   They almost did that last year, didn't they?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.120]   Came down to the wire.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.720]   I mean, there was a point in August when I was wondering,
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.400]   could this be the year that they do a end of January
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.360]   major iOS hardware event, not just an iPad event?
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.120]   But this is going to be the month where they're going to
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.440]   introduce the new phone and the new iPad at the same time.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.640]   Of course, that was just sort in the back of my mind.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.160]   It didn't work out to be true.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.120]   But Apple's the only company that could even try to do that,
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.440]   the competition among Android hands,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.640]   so it's so severe that if you don't at least have the perception
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.320]   that you're continually coming out with new hardware,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.080]   you really miss an opportunity.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.600]   Although 2012, I think, is going to be the biggest competition
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.200]   Apple has ever had, even for the iPhone.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   Android is still trying to get its way out of the tarpets.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.880]   But I think that Windows Mobile,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.680]   Windows Phone is really going to have a great showing in 2012.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.360]   Mango is a great update.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.520]   Whatever they've got in store for Windows Phone 8 in 2012
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   could really put it on the same footing, not as iOS 5,
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.280]   but maybe as iOS 4.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.520]   And that really could be the handset
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.560]   that makes a lot of people think,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.160]   "Gee, I really, really wanted an iPhone."
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.240]   But a lot of the basic, just holistic features
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.080]   that I really, really liked about the iPhone
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.560]   are also present in their own ways
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.440]   in this Windows Phone device.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.840]   So it might not be smart for them,
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.680]   if they're considering it,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.400]   it might not be smart for them to take any years off now on.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.960]   Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of pressure,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.120]   isn't there right now?
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   And I just got the new Google Galaxy Nexus Phone,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.640]   which is Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.680]   Google's got a big iOS update.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.440]   But traditionally, Apple has not paid attention
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.760]   to what other people are doing.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   So somebody in the chat made a very good point,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.440]   which is it's not just AT&T.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.080]   I mean, that isn't really the issue, is it?
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.320]   Because not only they have three carriers in the US,
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.640]   but they have carriers all over the world.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.880]   Maybe what they're waiting on is not 4G availability,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.760]   but a battery efficient 4G chip.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.600]   I mean, there's a lot of things.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.520]   If you've got good 3G, I think in most cases,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.120]   that's probably sufficient.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.440]   Yeah. Also 4G isn't a terribly compelling advantage right now.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.000]   It's a great option for people who are going to be spending
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.880]   a lot of time using that phone just as a wireless hotspot
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.080]   and an opportunity where it's tethered
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.120]   to the wall, we're storing power.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.560]   Right now, every single company,
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.880]   excuse me, it looks like every single company
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.400]   meters their 4G so that you can get really great speed,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.880]   but you just can't use it all that often.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.160]   You'd kind of want to keep it at 3G speed.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   Also, like you said, it's not a very power efficient mode,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.000]   so it burns out your battery really quickly.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.640]   Every time I travel, I happen to have a 4G phone
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.080]   in my pocket alongside the iPhone.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.600]   And I almost always keep it in 3G mode
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.400]   just to make sure that I've got something left
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.240]   at the end of the day so I can actually do something with it.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.560]   Right.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.960]   Yeah, I know that with my Galaxy S2,
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.720]   I find that the battery life is pretty short
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.160]   if I'm using it heavily, especially if I'm using something
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   that's going to really hit the 4G.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.760]   It's a pretty heavy hit there.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.440]   And I think that in some ways, these S versions,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.720]   I like my 4S.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.120]   It's kind of a skip year though.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.360]   I mean, there's not a lot of it.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.880]   You've got a couple components and you update the iOS.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.520]   And those are kind of the skip years, I think,
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.520]   for the system.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.040]   So I think Apple already has that built into some degree.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.480]   There's just suckers like us that, you know,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.960]   of course, feel like we need to have the new phone.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.400]   The people who are being made fun of in the new Samsung ads.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.240]   Yeah, what do you think?
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.120]   Actually, have I asked you guys about those ads?
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.160]   I don't think so.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.400]   So I think they're very funny, but they really are kind of a slap
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.320]   to iPhone users.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.840]   Yeah, I mean, they're funny.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.880]   And I feel sorry for any iPhone users who's offended by it.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.720]   I guess so.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.440]   If you identify with the hipsters in there,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.080]   you're probably something wrong with you.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.120]   And if you want to use it to re-energize your own built-in
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.800]   sense of Apple secure it as pure already arrogance,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.880]   you could say that this is the sort of ad
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.320]   that a number two provider aims at the number one provider
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.520]   because they're trying to get something going on.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.120]   This is exactly the sort of ads that Apple used to launch
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.080]   when they were thought of as a struggling company that's
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.960]   not doing anything right.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.560]   Samsung isn't in that same category,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   but it's a defensive ad as opposed to an offensive one.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.680]   It's funny, who cares?
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   I think it's very funny.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.520]   You're right though.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.880]   Apple way back in 1984 when the Mac came out,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.440]   treated, acted as if PC users were lemmings.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.760]   Remember that second year Super Bowl commercial,
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.440]   which by the way, in the Isaacson book they talk about,
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.560]   and a lot of people hated with the lemmings going off the cliff
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.020]   that were PC users.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.040]   And of course, in the first Super Bowl commercial
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.800]   where they're sitting here listening to Big Brother,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.560]   and it was clearly PC users,
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.320]   they haven't been so mean ever since.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.800]   In fact, the switch commercials weren't mean,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.040]   and certainly the Amma Mac, I'm a PC commercial,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.680]   John Hodgman was lovable.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.600]   He wasn't like the barista.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.320]   Even with the mustache, John Hodgman still is adorable.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.800]   He's always lovable.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.000]   In this commercial, the Samsung commercial,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.400]   you guys sitting there saying,
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.120]   I could never own a Samsung phone.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.040]   I'm creative in his buddies.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.920]   You're a barista.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.760]   Right.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.680]   And the message really is get over yourself,
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.840]   and there is a better phone out there.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.560]   But by the way, and this is a huge story,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.120]   Samsung now selling tablets in Australia.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.880]   The injunction was overturned.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.320]   I guess it was a temporary injunction.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.860]   The battle continues.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:25.200]   And looks like Samsung will continue to sell devices
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.320]   in the US.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.040]   The Apple's gonna continue to slug it out in court,
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.200]   but they weren't able to stop.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.040]   I don't know how Germany's going.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.240]   Remember, that was another country, right?
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.640]   Germany was another country they couldn't sell.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.960]   Samsung Galaxy Tab.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.440]   And I don't know if they were able to sell it or not.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.280]   No big loss.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.200]   It's not like anybody really wants one of these.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.720]   But I'm just saying, if you wanted one,
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.600]   you could get one now.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.440]   - But I think that sometimes things like these lawsuits
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.720]   also called into question the viability of the Galaxy Tab
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.840]   for people who are thinking about what am I gonna do next?
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.360]   - That was the purpose maybe.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.000]   - Yeah, so regardless of whether the Apple wins or loses,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.760]   because this market is moving so quickly
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.280]   that you don't sell that million units quickly
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.640]   or two million units or three million units
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   or whatever that number is.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.000]   If you don't sell it quickly,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.320]   you may never get over that hump.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.840]   And I think that that's, part of this is just
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.440]   throwing a little grease onto the road.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.920]   - Right.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.760]   There was a good article.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.040]   I can't remember where it was.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.880]   Wow, I wish I could.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.680]   If you were a guys remember, you could tell me.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.880]   I thought it was a very interesting think piece saying,
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.040]   well, you know, Apple really made kind of the
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   platonic tablet and did so almost intentionally
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.320]   by saying, look, the platonic ideal of a tablet is this.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.640]   And there really is, there aren't a whole lot
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.960]   of different ways you can make a tablet.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.080]   They in a sense said, and we own it.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.120]   So go ahead and try to make a tablet
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.200]   that doesn't have any.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.560]   So Apple's lawyers said the Samsung that they could make
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.720]   a tablet if it had a shape that isn't rectangular
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.080]   or doesn't have rounded corners that has thick frames
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.040]   rather than a thin rim around the front surface.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.400]   The front surface isn't entirely flat.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.880]   Profile isn't thin.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.560]   The appearance is cluttered.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.640]   In other words, they're saying,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.200]   if you want to make anything decent, it better not,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.680]   it better, you can't look like us.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   And we have an effect on the only way to make a tablet.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.560]   - Yeah, that's embarrassing for Apple to even say that.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.440]   They've been, essentially what they're saying is that
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.280]   our signature feature of our device is that it has no
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.680]   signature features.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.120]   So if you, there's any part of your device that is
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.680]   unembellished, unremarkable, essentially,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.560]   we own that concept of on we, of design on we,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.960]   that's an Apple trademark that's a Johnny Ive innovation.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.040]   - How dare you have, I got a white wall over there
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   with no picture on a hangout.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.880]   - We have that.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.040]   - I need to give Apple like a $7 royalty
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.840]   'cause I haven't put something on that wall.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.560]   - But I can't blame Apple on this.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.880]   I mean, they did create the platonic ideal of a tablet.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.320]   I wonder though, if courts are gonna say, well, you know,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.280]   come on, you want us to make a crappy tablet,
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.040]   that's the only way we can sell a tablet is if it's crappy
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.960]   because yours are so good that no one can copy you.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.440]   No one can make a good tablet.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.560]   Because you own good tablets because you, you in effect,
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.320]   create the platonic ideal of a tablet.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.240]   - If they, they've copyrighted taste.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.360]   - Taste, yes.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.920]   You can make something, it just can't be good
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.880]   and we will sue you.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.720]   - That's a good one.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.680]   - Oh, and by the way, Apple says, it's a crappy tablet anyway.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.320]   We still don't like it.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.960]   Yeah, the problem Apple has with the Samsung Galaxy tab
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.760]   is not that it's a good tablet.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.600]   Let's make that very clear.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.000]   Oh well.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.400]   But you will be vindicated, Andy and Aco,
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   because the arbiter of all things design, Jacob Nielsen,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.040]   of the Nielsen Norman group who is a UI,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.400]   a web interface expert, a UI expert.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.760]   In fact, he contracts himself off at hundreds of thousands
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.120]   of dollars to help people understand user interface
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.360]   and make their sites more accessible.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.880]   - He wrote one of the definitive books on website.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.280]   I think it was called on web usability,
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.880]   the blue and green book, right?
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.920]   I own a really great book.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.560]   - Yeah, has said that the Kindle Fire is a car wreck.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.160]   (laughing)
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.760]   You know, it's the first time I've seen him do
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.480]   an effective review of a product based on its usability.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.760]   I don't think he's ever done that before,
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.840]   at least not that I know of.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.000]   But in this case, Jacob Nielsen,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   everybody can be happy to know.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.800]   I like the Kindle, it made me feel like an idiot.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.520]   But I was like, I'm not gonna argue with Jacob Nielsen,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.960]   but I'm apparently an idiot for liking the Kindle Fire
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.560]   because it's just the worst piece of crap he's ever seen.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.040]   Well, I'm see fine.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.880]   - What's your experience?
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.560]   Because I haven't picked one up yet.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.800]   I really actually wanna get one to test.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   And you do like it, do you like the interface?
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.120]   - It's fantastic.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.000]   - You use it a lot, how much do you use it compared to your eyes?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.800]   - Oh, I brought it to France, not the iPad.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.280]   And the thing is, I hardly use my iPad
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.400]   now that I have an Air, now I've always had an Air.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.400]   Because I just want a keyboard.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.320]   You know, look, it's not, if the question is iPad or Fire,
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.120]   get an iPad.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.760]   But if you're looking for a simple, inexpensive tablet,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.960]   I think the Fire is not bad at all.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   That's an I know, it's fake phrase.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.120]   It's not bad.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.280]   - I think it's actually good.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.160]   I don't even think that it's good enough for its cost.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.600]   I think it's actually a good tablet.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.160]   - No, I thought you hated it.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.680]   - Oh, no, no, I like it a lot.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.280]   As a matter of fact, a lot of people have been,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.320]   every time someone, every time a Jacob Nielsen comes out
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.000]   and says bad things about the Fire,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.480]   every time there's a study saying, oh, they're getting
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.720]   Amazon's getting a whole bunch of returns,
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.440]   I'll get like two or three people on Twitter say,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.760]   so are you gonna admit you were wrong when you said
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.000]   that you personally think it's a good tablet?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.960]   No, I still think it's a good tablet.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.800]   - Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   - It's just a different opinion.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.640]   Oh, no, it's a--
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.400]   - You and I are in agreement then.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.240]   - We agree.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.440]   - When I reviewed it a few weeks ago, I thought that
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.280]   it's not a competitor to the iPad.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.440]   I think it's a good counterpart to the iPad.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.720]   Not like any way would ever want to own both
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.920]   at the same time, but there are people who don't have
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.360]   $499 to spend on an iPad or they can't justify
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.600]   $499 to spend on a tablet.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.120]   And for that, taken as a whole package,
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.960]   I think that the $199 fires are really, really good deal
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.040]   because they'll give them the knowledge I keep coming up with
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.000]   is that when Apple decided to come up
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.040]   with a commercial response to the netbook,
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.840]   they didn't build another netbook.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.520]   They looked at the features that people were responding to
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.640]   and that were making it into such a success
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   and they built a new device that sort of triggered
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.240]   those same sort of responses.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.640]   I think that the fires that has the same relationship
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.840]   with the iPad in that it doesn't try to be the iPad
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.880]   but it tries to satisfy the same things
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.520]   that the iPad satisfies for so many buyers.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.200]   Again, there are a lot of refedges.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.600]   I think that I mentioned almost all of them in my review
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.200]   that the interface is not as responsive as it should be.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.640]   The physical design has some really clumsy oversize on it.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.600]   Like the sleep switch is hard to find the part.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.160]   It's hard, I had a turn, every time I hand the fire
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.680]   to someone who's never held them before,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.160]   they have the exact same initial reaction that I did
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.200]   when I took it out of the box,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.400]   which was to turn it over and over and over in their hands
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.880]   looking for the power switch.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.240]   And then when they finally find it, as they're holding it,
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.160]   they will inevitably cause it to go to sleep
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.520]   because they happen to have their hands
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.200]   like right where that little button is
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.600]   as they're holding it up.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.520]   So there are definitely a lot of rough edges
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.920]   that need to be sanded off, but taken as an entire solution,
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.160]   I think it's a very, very nice thing.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.000]   Now, in the couple of weeks since it was released,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.240]   Barnes and Noble came out with the Nook tablet,
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.440]   which in many ways addresses the problems
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.080]   that people have been having with the fire.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.440]   It's a lot zippier.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.840]   The web browser is when it's in many situations,
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.360]   not most situations, it feels faster.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.040]   The interface is less cluttered.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.240]   And when you tap a button, it always highlights
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   to make sure that you know that,
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.720]   oh, you don't need to tap this button again.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.200]   I promise you that I'm actually working on this
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.120]   and it's actually more responsive and faster.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.960]   The difference is that it's not hooked up to
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.440]   that really great constellation of services
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.280]   that the Kindle Fire has hooked up to.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.560]   It's the Barnes and Noble device is really good for newspaper.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.920]   Excuse me, really good for books.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.520]   For magazines, man, they're doing a much better job
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.440]   in Barnes than Amazon in creating magazines
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.040]   that are actually formatted to fit
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.760]   a seven inch form factor and actually work.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.960]   But if you want to go beyond that,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.680]   you really can't hook up with your downloadable movies.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.720]   You really can't hook up with TV shows and stuff like that.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.080]   They've just, it does come with a Netflix app.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.160]   It does come with a Hulu app.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.720]   But that's not like what you can do with the fire,
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.000]   which is to simply decide that I want to have
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.800]   three episodes of house to watch on my flight.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.400]   And then three seconds later, you've got them,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.200]   they're downloadable and you can actually use them
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.280]   not just on the fire, but on pretty much any other device
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.120]   that you have.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.160]   So, taken as a constellation of things,
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.320]   I think it's a wonderful, wonderful thing, the fire.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.840]   - I apologize for impugning.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.640]   I'm sorry if I rattled on, it's just that
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.560]   I've had to make this defense too many times
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.240]   over the past two or three weeks.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.040]   - Now, did you guys talk about this last week?
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.960]   Because I realize this Nielsen article came out on Tuesday
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.920]   or Monday of last week.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.720]   Did you guys talk about this last week at all?
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.800]   - I don't think so.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.440]   I think that we talked about a couple of weeks ago,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.920]   so it was like, no one wants to hear about this anymore.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.480]   (laughs)
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.840]   - He says, it's, Kindle Fire offers a disappointingly
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.400]   poor user experience, but his issue is the seven inch,
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.480]   I think, displays his fat finger problem,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.400]   makes mobile site superior.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.520]   And he says, "Our testing of the iPad shows
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.880]   full sites work well on 10 inch tablets,
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.800]   but mobile sites are required for anything less than that."
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.840]   He has an interesting statement here.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.720]   He says, "Seven inch tablets either have a glorious future
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.640]   or will fail miserably."
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.200]   - It isn't, isn't the old statement, isn't it?
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.320]   - Isn't this the amplification of the internet
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.160]   really connected a lot to these tablets
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.680]   where none of the websites, I mean, even on an iPad,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.000]   using a regular full website, it's fine if you're just
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.280]   doing basic surfing, but as soon as you have to fill a form
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.720]   or do anything else that you're just like,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.280]   oh, I wish these guys had an app.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   You know, like, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.120]   - I wish to.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.960]   - You know, yeah, they had all my, you know,
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.800]   I don't want to, like I go to, you know,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.720]   I don't use Orbitz webpage anymore.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.160]   You know, if I'm going to go on my iOS, you know,
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.000]   I just use the--
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.080]   - Well, I wonder though, down the road,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.280]   if people will either, you're right.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.560]   I mean, the full size website is gone or going away.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.680]   They'll either have an app or they'll do a good mobile site
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.560]   using HTML5 that's like an app,
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.480]   but you go to the website and it's an app.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.320]   I mean, you can totally do that.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.520]   That was funny 'cause that was the original plan for iOS.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:07.560]   Anyway, I'm glad, okay, so, and Andy, I apologize
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.040]   for some reason I thought that you didn't like the fire.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.440]   I remember defending it, but it obviously wasn't on this show.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.080]   But, you know, you and me and Paul Therat,
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.800]   oh, maybe it was Paul that didn't, was it Paul?
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.640]   No, Paul likes it.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.480]   - Paul likes it too.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.320]   - Yeah.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.840]   - But he doesn't like the touch.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.680]   - So I don't know.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.760]   - Well, it was Steve.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.400]   - Steve didn't, but he had three bad ones
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.120]   in a row, so I wouldn't like it either.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.960]   - Well, in Tuit, there was some--
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.200]   - On Tuit, there were some people.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.040]   We won't, we shall remain nameless
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.520]   'cause I can't remember who it was,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.920]   and they didn't like it.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.280]   Moving along, we're gonna take a break,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.600]   come back with more Andy and Aco, Alex Lindsey, our iOS tip.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.000]   Do you guys have a lion and iOS tip?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.840]   Is that too much to ask?
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.200]   - I has a lion tip.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.400]   - He has lion, iOS?
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.520]   I mean, I know you're in Japan.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.640]   - I'm working on it.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.920]   - I'll give you a minute to work on it.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.360]   How about that?
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.200]   - There we go.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.080]   - And then I'll tell you where you can get an iPhone 4S
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.960]   cheap just to time for the holidays.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.200]   But first, a word from Carboneight Online Backup.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.520]   Any time you do backup, you gotta have a cut in my opinion.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.880]   And I'll just say it, it's my opinion.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.240]   It's gotta be automatic.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.480]   Come on, do you remember to backup?
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.000]   If you have to tie a string around your finger
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.200]   or put a reminder on Siri to backup, that's not backup.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.920]   And by the way, backup's fine.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   I have a hard driver, a thumb driver,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.480]   a CD or DVD or something that's right next to the computer.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.920]   But I posit this question.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.120]   - Posit?
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.400]   - I'm going to posit.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.240]   - Ew.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.600]   - I guess I could have said pose.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.720]   I'll posit this hypothetical.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.880]   What if there's a fire, flood, disaster,
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.320]   your house burns down, your people break in
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.040]   and steal everything and your backups
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.960]   sitting right next to the computer?
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.880]   I would ask you, my friends, ladies and gentlemen
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.240]   of the jury, what do you do then?
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.200]   What will you do in the words of Karl Malden?
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.640]   What will you do?
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.880]   Does anybody remember, nobody remembers that.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.280]   That's just me.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.160]   That's the old American Express ad.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.320]   Carbonite did not steal this, I did.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.400]   If you have automatic online backup,
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.600]   then your stuff's safe forever.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.320]   And by the way, the nice thing about carbonite
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.240]   is it's cloud storage.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.320]   You can log in and see your stuff anytime.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.200]   On any computer, on your iPhone, your BlackBerry,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.400]   your Android phone, it's always there.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.280]   And the best price less than five bucks a month.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.400]   Less $59 a year.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.880]   Actually, I'm gonna give you an even better price
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.720]   in a second.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:33.600]   Encrypted, so it's private, Mac or PC, so it's safe.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.760]   And when you use the offer code, Mac break,
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.480]   you'll get two weeks free and two extra months
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.760]   when you sign up for the one year plan,
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.000]   14 months for the price of two.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.680]   They do have some new plans you should take a look at.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.720]   People have complained to me,
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.040]   it's only your internal drive, yes, for five bucks a month.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.320]   But if you want more, you can backup external drives too.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.480]   There's just a different plan for that.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.800]   They even have multiple computer plans.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.320]   They call it their business package.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.120]   But go to carbonite.com.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.840]   You can use Mac break as you offer code
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.560]   for any of those plans.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.120]   And you get 14 months with price of two
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.600]   and two weeks free trial.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.880]   It's nice to try before you buy.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.000]   Highly recommend it.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.240]   Backup, move forward.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.680]   I love that slogan.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.960]   You gotta back it up to get it back.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.640]   So do it right with carbonite.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:20.080]   I think they're one of the last unlimited backup plans out there.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:26.200]   So, Radio Shack is gonna give you a $30 discount
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.320]   on the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 4 starting Sunday.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.400]   Just thought I'd let you know, according to 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.760]   $30 discount, okay, you know, it's still 170 bucks,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.880]   but that's not bad.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.960]   I guess if you sold your old phone through something
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.280]   like Gazelle and you got 170 bucks, you'd break even.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.880]   That's of course for a new two year contracts.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.080]   Radio Shack does have a trade in program
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.880]   which might give you enough to get the phone for free.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.000]   Target, gonna give you $25 back.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.920]   Why are they doing this?
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.160]   Is it just normal holiday promotion or are they having to,
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.920]   I mean, it's not easy to get an iPhone 4s.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.200]   Lisa wanted to get once she went to the AT&T store.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.480]   They said, "We don't have any.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.560]   "We're out of stock."
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   She went to the Apple store.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.280]   They had some but limited supplies.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.400]   She had to get a 32 gigabyte.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.320]   They didn't have any 16s left.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.400]   So why promote this if you're selling them out?
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.760]   Because when I'm selling the hardware,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.880]   they're selling the service.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.120]   They make the money on the contract.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   I get it.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.160]   So they're just subsidizing it a little bit more.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.200]   So they're not trying to sell iPhones
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.920]   or trying to sell customers to their own services.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.960]   So let's forgive my stupidity.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.880]   Give my stupidity.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.280]   We're trying to drag you in with it.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   It's like down the trip.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.680]   It's pulling me in.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.280]   It's okay. You've been in France.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.760]   (laughing)
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.160]   You're having a cookie.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   (laughing)
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.600]   Well, that rich, all those rich sauces.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.160]   All those emus, boosh.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.520]   My mouth is emus, but my brain dead.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.920]   5.1 iOS beta two pre-release out and yay.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:10.440]   Individual picture deletion from your photo stream.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.080]   Thank you.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.960]   I was getting tired of pictures of my butt
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.720]   showing up on my desktop.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.280]   Don't like it.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.760]   Don't wanna see it.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.160]   You prefer to sync those manually.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.720]   I wanna sync those manually.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.480]   You can choose the best butt shot for your desktop.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.320]   Can I be honest?
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.680]   It's not so much the desktop syncing.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.560]   It's the showing up when my Apple TV
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.920]   goes into screensaver mode on my 60-inch display.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.080]   I don't want to say that.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.320]   At a dinner party with your parents.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.160]   (laughing)
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.560]   These were supposed to be my travel pictures.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.120]   (laughing)
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.200]   I think it does show the fuzzy lines
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.640]   that Apple's drawn for that kind of feature.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.800]   Exactly.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.320]   I think that people are really thinking of it
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   not as the million mile sync cable
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.080]   between your iPhone and your desktop or the iPad.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.160]   They're thinking of it as,
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.240]   "Here is the central photo album
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.520]   that I will always have for all my pictures."
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.040]   When all the features that Apple put into it,
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.360]   pretty firmly says, "No, no, no.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.120]   We're just giving you sort of a buffer
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.080]   so that if you need to grab a picture,
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.840]   we'll keep a limited number of photos
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   for a limited amount of time."
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.160]   So I think that's another example of Apple
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.520]   really not communicating well
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.240]   what these iCloud services are for
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.720]   and how you're supposed to be using them.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.280]   But yeah, it was a feature they should have put in right away
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.000]   because I've never, not being,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.480]   I have no interest in what my butt looks like,
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.040]   Leila, great granted.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:36.880]   I do not think I--
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.320]   You can't see it from that side.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.160]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.640]   What is it about the men at the head of Mighty Empire
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.400]   is a powerful position that says,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.920]   "I must take pictures of my bikini area
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.720]   and cause a scare that I have written down."
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   Do you fear success?
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.560]   No, I haven't done that.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.560]   Do you fear success?
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.200]   I want to be in the House of Representatives.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.680]   I hear that's the best way.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.600]   No, but really what it is is,
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.760]   I have every picture that I take,
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.920]   three out of every four are blurry or,
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.600]   I'm not a perfect photographer
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.800]   and I don't really want all the bad shots to get duplicated.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.320]   I want to be able to delete shots
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.160]   and then say, "Okay, this is my photo stream."
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.520]   Not all the bad shots too.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.360]   That's all.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.040]   Particulous, it's working about,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.560]   for me it's working 70% of the way
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.720]   that I would hope it would,
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.560]   where there's so many times when I think that,
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.440]   I want to use, I took a picture with my iPhone
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.760]   earlier in the day, I know that,
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.000]   "Oh God, I want to use this in my blog post tonight."
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.400]   I'm thinking, "Oh great, I've got photo stream.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.040]   I don't have to hook anything up."
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:29.880]   Like, that's nice.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.720]   Yes.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.560]   It'll just appear in iPhoto
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   and then I'll click on iPhoto
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.400]   and I'll get that screen saying,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.920]   "Photo stream is a service that lets you wirelessly sync photos."
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   Well, I know that, isn't it,
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.760]   they're automatically,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.280]   click this button to use photo stream.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.160]   Aren't I using it already?
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   Okay, I'll click on this and then suddenly,
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.360]   like very, very slowly I'll see,
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.040]   okay, there's a picture of something I didn't care about,
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.320]   a picture of something I didn't care about,
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.560]   a picture of something I don't care about.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.080]   It's like, can't you just like sort of push thumbnails
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.360]   and I can then like pull down, I want this one, right?
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.200]   There you go.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.040]   Oh, there you go.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:49:59.880]   It's, I don't think--
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   - Is there a way to force sync it?
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.720]   In iPhoto?
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.800]   I mean, I get it, right?
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.000]   - Yeah, I mean, you could,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.680]   I do think that it still needs,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.520]   just for anthropological reasons,
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.360]   a big button that says,
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.480]   "Sync my photos right now."
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.280]   Because there are so many times,
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.040]   I will sit there and think,
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.640]   now, I know that this,
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.800]   I only took two or three pictures,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.120]   it should be dribbling in like right about now
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:23.960]   and it's not driven again.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.800]   So I'll give it another minute.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.840]   No, it should be coming in right now.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.240]   And at least if there is a button
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.480]   that I can physically push to say,
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.640]   right now, make sure that I want to,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.400]   make sure you understand that I want you
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.560]   to sync up my photos right now.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.800]   And if nothing happens after that,
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.560]   then I know I've got a problem that I need to solve.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.320]   But this sort of thing,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.200]   we're just sort of waiting for something to delivery.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.560]   We have snail mail for stuff like that
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.280]   for that sort of ill get there eventually
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.560]   or not at all and look how well
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.800]   the Postal Service is doing.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.080]   Apple's supposed to be better than that.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.920]   - Yeah.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.760]   (laughs)
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.600]   - Well, it's supposed to be better
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.240]   than the Postal Service.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.160]   - You know, are you guys having any,
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.080]   with the current OS,
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.840]   or are you having any issues with headsets,
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.280]   you know, where you hear,
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.960]   where the person on the other side,
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.440]   here's an echo.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.280]   Is it--
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.640]   - I don't believe that's the iPhone,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.120]   I believe that's AT&T.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.960]   - Is it really?
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.800]   - Yes.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   - It only happens when--
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.640]   - I get it all the time.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.400]   - Only happens when I have my headset plugged
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.240]   into my iPhone.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.080]   - Oh.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.200]   - So if I pull headset out, works fine.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.440]   - Oh, well then that could be a hardware or I OS.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.440]   - It takes like 10 seconds.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.480]   So what happens is like,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   now I'm in the situation where I put my headset in
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.000]   and I call somebody and they're like,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.080]   I hear this huge echo of myself and I go,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.040]   wait, hold on, give it a minute,
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.840]   give it a minute and then it's fine.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.960]   And I, my theory is,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.720]   it has something to do with noise cancellation
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.440]   where it's using,
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.160]   it's actually using my iPhone or something
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.120]   as a, you know, and it's bouncing around
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.920]   and then it's realizing about five or 10 seconds
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.760]   into the conversation like,
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.560]   ooh, wrong dial.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.400]   - So--
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.240]   - I don't know why this would make a difference
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   with Jack in our chat room says,
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.200]   check your sound check settings.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.880]   - I don't see why that would make a difference.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.800]   That's not doing that for the--
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.640]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.960]   - But I'll try it.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.360]   But it's kind of been kind of a constant--
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.760]   - I've had that problem just with AT&T,
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.080]   but that's, I guess echoing could be a lot of different things.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:05.840]   And that what you,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.640]   obviously what you're reporting is something else, you know,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.480]   it's a--
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.320]   - I've gotten into the habit of just take,
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.480]   pull him, I mean, I'm surprised at how often,
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.680]   but I don't know the person well
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.440]   if it's someone who's an, you know, a client or whatever,
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.240]   I just pull my head, I use my headset, which is--
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.040]   - And are you using, you're using the Edomodix
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.960]   or using the iPola?
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:20.800]   - Yeah.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.120]   - You're using that high quality,
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.720]   $150 Edomodix.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.560]   - Yes.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.760]   - So I didn't think it's that.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.560]   - Which by the way,
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.680]   after you spend $100 on them,
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.520]   just in case you're wondering,
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.600]   they do not survive the wash.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.440]   - You think he'd stay 100--
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.560]   - Do not wash them, that's a good idea.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.000]   Even if you've got earwax all over them.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.440]   - No, do not put them in the wash,
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.600]   especially not in a warm cycle.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.520]   - Dip the two-tip.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.360]   - Like a lump.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.160]   - In, I don't know what,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.760]   I don't know what, never mind.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.800]   iTunes 10.5.2 is here, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.920]   if you've been waiting,
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.800]   according to Apple, 10.5.2 includes several improvements
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.480]   for iTunes match and fixes an audio distortion problem
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.720]   on playing or importing certain CDs,
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.400]   none of which I have experienced,
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.160]   but that's apparently an issue.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.000]   It is, you know, it's a software update,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.640]   full download, 102 megabytes for the Mac,
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.280]   66.13 megabytes for 32-bit windows,
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.200]   68 megabytes for 64-bit windows.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.680]   Boy, if you've ever used iTunes on Windows,
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.360]   you'd think it would be bigger than the Mac version.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.400]   It's such a hog.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.840]   Such a hog.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.920]   - Yeah.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.200]   - No, are you guys using iTunes match?
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.400]   - Yeah.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.480]   - Are you still having sync problems?
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.360]   - Oh, you know, that's a good question.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.200]   - Yeah.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   - Because I haven't installed the new iTunes yet,
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.840]   but I'm still working on one or two big issues
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.200]   where my smart playlists are not syncing
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.480]   in a reliable fashion.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.800]   I did learn, it's, I'm sorry to say that I'm still learning
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.520]   about how to get this thing to do exactly what you expected
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.360]   to do.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.560]   One of the things is that I've learned
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.040]   and I've been telling people that part of the process
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   is really going through,
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.640]   clicking on the music button,
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.000]   music view of your library,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.120]   clicking on the iCloud column on the list view
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.240]   and carefully looking at every single file you've got
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.760]   that iTunes is saying, for some reason,
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.240]   I can't get this to work with iCloud.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.280]   Usually on a, on an element by element basis,
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.000]   it's easy to fix all these things,
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.240]   then suddenly all these playlists will work again.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.760]   I don't know why Apple decided that you've got 112 songs
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.840]   in your playlist.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.520]   One of them does not work with iCloud.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.600]   Rather than syncing all but that one of them,
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.520]   we're going to make this entire playlist un-syncable,
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.040]   which is good in that it does fly,
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.720]   it does call your attention to the problem
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.480]   and force you to fix it as opposed to never seeing,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.000]   never hearing that song or that playlist
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.080]   and never being aware of the problem,
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.720]   but I wish it were a little bit more vociferous
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.520]   in the way it worked.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.680]   But I still have a problem where the way that I always
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.360]   listen to my podcast is not through the podcast tab
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.320]   of my iPhone, but through a playlist that always
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:06.320]   automatically has my most recent 25 freshest podcasts,
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   no matter what the show is, no matter how many episodes
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.800]   there are, automatic, and every time that I listen to it,
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.640]   it automatically gets removed from this playlist
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.600]   and then a fresher one comes in and takes its place.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.120]   It's boom, work and fine for me,
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.200]   ever since smart playlists existed,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.320]   ever since podcasts existed for iTunes,
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.360]   but now it just plain don't work.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.560]   I'm getting some new stuff, some old stuff,
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.000]   it's never in chronological order,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.280]   which was absolutely the way that it worked
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.720]   every single time before.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.440]   So I've gone, every time that I come up with a problem
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.200]   like this, especially with new software,
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.000]   I go through phases of problem solving
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.880]   where phase one is I should be in exactly the same position
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.960]   as the user, I should try to figure this out on my own
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.640]   without getting any help from anybody.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.520]   And then there's the, okay, I'm going to use the same,
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.120]   no, then there's the, I'm going to use the same resources
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.480]   that a regular user would have.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.840]   I'm going to go to the support forums,
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.200]   I'm going to Google for answers.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.160]   And then comes to the, okay,
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.600]   do I email Chris Brin's Mac world address
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.520]   or his Gmail address?
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.360]   And I'm just short of the one where I start
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.320]   like talking to people at Apple saying,
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.600]   do you know who I am?
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.040]   - Greg, what the hell?
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.840]   - I just want to listen to answer me this
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.560]   and it won't let me listen to answer me this
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.200]   or the bugle or the NPR stuff,
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.760]   but I'm really getting said about this.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.080]   Now, I don't want to be said.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:25.920]   I'm not a sad person.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.360]   - Well, I don't think, I don't think
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.880]   a match does podcasts, right?
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:29.880]   Or does it?
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.280]   - I think just as long.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.560]   - It doesn't do iTunes match.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.480]   I'm talking about the changes with iCloud
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.840]   for some reason every time.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.960]   - I cloud syncing will not do this.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.840]   If I were to turn off iCloud,
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.720]   syncing on my device and have it sync only by copper tether,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.560]   it would work.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.120]   Even when I sync through copper,
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.040]   it doesn't really work properly.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.600]   So it's a problem with so many layers.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.880]   And it's the worst kind of problem,
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.400]   sort of problem that illustrates your own personal ignorance,
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.160]   something you thought you understood.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.640]   Apparently for five years,
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.600]   I thought I understood how syncing worked and now.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.160]   There was some sort of subtlety
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.560]   that had been eluding me for all these years.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.360]   - We talked a couple of weeks ago.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.840]   You guys weren't here.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.960]   I think Jason Snow was about some tips for getting IT.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.800]   He's written some great articles.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.720]   - Yeah, Mackerel has a great bunch of stuff on there.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.640]   And one of the issues is it not syncing songs
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.360]   that are below a certain,
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.280]   I think 96 kilobits and so forth.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.480]   But it's very simple to fix that and I have,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.840]   I am getting, now that you mention it, it looks like,
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.360]   and I can't understand why this playlist
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.200]   would even be on anything.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.360]   I am getting some odd.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.200]   This is for sure not something I put on my iPhone,
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:44.800]   the iTunes artwork screensaver playlist.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   And it's got songs, a bunch of songs from Ziya.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.960]   Maybe my kid did this.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.360]   I don't know.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.720]   I don't know what this is.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.040]   That's kind of part of the problem too, I guess, isn't it?
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.760]   That if you have multiple people using.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   - Well also for some reason, so many of my podcasts now,
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.560]   the album artwork is not the artwork of the podcast.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.720]   It's now the cover art for the B-52's first album.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.480]   - That's, I've had problems as well.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.720]   So it's like, it could have been worse
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.120]   through our uglier albums than to see the B-52's.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.560]   But that's not Andy Zoltzmann.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.120]   That's not John Oliver.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.680]   That's just not right.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.480]   - And Sean asks us in our chat room,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.120]   you guys should do an update on Ping.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.320]   What's that story?
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.160]   What?
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.920]   (laughing)
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.120]   - Nothing to say.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:35.560]   I think that before the iOS 5 update,
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.680]   a couple of Apple engineers went to that vacant lot
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.200]   adjoining the Apple campus,
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.640]   where these little stovepipes sticking out of the ground
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.040]   from the cement bunker where they buried,
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.520]   that's a very Ping, and keep like throwing it
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.320]   like little bits of food and water.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.360]   They keep throwing it at a cell phone charger saying,
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.120]   it's, we'll dig you up there as soon as we figure out
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.120]   that it's tactically convenient for us to dig you up there.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.760]   Until then, they put Ping.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.320]   - We could say the Ping is dead long live the Ping.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.320]   - No.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.960]   - The thing is dead is, the Ping is dead.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.640]   - Ping is dead, the Ping is dead.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.560]   - There you know, the Ping is dead.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.600]   - Ding dong, the Ping is dead.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.120]   Which old Ping?
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.280]   Apple's old Ping.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.360]   (laughs)
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:20.640]   - Any, what's your experience with the match?
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.120]   Is it working for you, Alex?
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.920]   Or do you share our pitches and bones?
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.240]   - I have not done that yet.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.880]   I'm trying to all, I'm trying to,
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:29.520]   well my library on my laptop,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.720]   I've been traveling a little bit as you may have known.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.560]   - Yes.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.400]   - And my--
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.920]   - See, that's why I thought maybe you would have done it
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.840]   'cause it's great if you're traveling.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.520]   - My problem is that my Mac Mini that's connected
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.760]   to my real library is at the house
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.960]   and I just haven't really sorted out the,
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.400]   getting it all set up.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.840]   So, I just wanna make sure that once I do it,
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.440]   correct once and for all, I'm gonna do it next week
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.280]   when I get home.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.560]   I'm actually gonna be home for like five days I think.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.280]   - Yay, this is your Christmas vacation is at home.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.120]   - I gotta say, I'm not having problems
[00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.960]   with iTunes's match.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.480]   I think I'm having a problem with iCloud.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.360]   iTunes's matches working great.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.240]   So much so that I was so pleased that,
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.600]   I buy most of my music through Amazon
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.520]   just because, and the Amazon Downloader app
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.680]   will automatically, every time you make a purchase
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.240]   through the Amazon website,
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.160]   will automatically download the file
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.560]   and install it, copy it into your iTunes library.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.560]   I was really, really happy to find that then iTunes match
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.240]   will automatically see that this,
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.320]   take this track that's been added to the library
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.640]   that I've bought from Amazon
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.920]   and instantly make it available to me
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.840]   through iTunes match and all my devices.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.200]   So, that's even like double the reason
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.640]   why I use Amazon for my music purchases
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.080]   instead of iTunes anymore.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.560]   Because iTunes doesn't give me,
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.560]   iTunes will not automatically allow me
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.240]   to have that sort of thing where I can,
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.400]   on any Amazon, I won't install my stuff
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.880]   in a cloud player automatically.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.240]   I won't install my stuff in other music players automatically,
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.680]   but I've got a really good one-way pipeline
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.760]   that iTunes match will cover for everything else.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.480]   - This just in, we talked a couple of weeks ago
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.760]   about the Sotheby's auction of the original Apple
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.480]   founding corporate papers,
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.560]   including the document getting Ron Wayne out of it
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.440]   from 12 days later.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.040]   The biggest dumb move in history.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.280]   - You know what, in that documentary about Jobs,
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.320]   while they were unaccountably driving him
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.440]   around Las Vegas in a limousine,
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.120]   Ron Wayne said, "Nah, I'm fine with it.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.360]   What the hell, you know?"
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.760]   - His explanation is pretty interesting.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.120]   I mean, about other different-
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.200]   - He was risk adverse.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.040]   - He just didn't want to do that.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.720]   - Exactly, he was interviewed a couple times.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.960]   - Yeah, he was interviewed a couple times about this,
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.320]   and he says that it was probably because the way that,
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.800]   or at least his understanding of the way
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.080]   the corporations were being set up,
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.720]   that if this thing tanked,
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.960]   he personally would be liable for the company,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.480]   he would be liable for share of the company's debts,
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.880]   and having survived that before he was really not interested
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.960]   in letting himself get into that kind of risky gun.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960]   And-
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   - The auction, apparently the documents were owned
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.120]   by somebody named Wayne Soddy, I'm sorry, Wade Soddy,
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.000]   he'd bought him from Ron Wayne.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.760]   In 1994 for several thousand dollars,
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.240]   sold for,
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.240]   divinating 1.594 million dollars.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.080]   Let's just round it up, say 1.6 million.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:18.920]   - Wow.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.840]   - Wow!
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.480]   - And that's Sotheby's, that's not eBay's,
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.880]   you know, that's not a shill buyer.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.960]   - Yeah, no, absolutely, it's not eBay.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.440]   They don't say who the winning bidder was,
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.080]   but the phone, the winning bid came via phone,
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.480]   it was 1.35 million,
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.440]   and then they tack on Sotheby's, tax on 12%,
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.560]   just for fun.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.160]   So, wow, wow!
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.760]   1.35 million dollars, somebody bid for these documents,
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.000]   I have a feeling it was Paul Allen, he's gonna,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.080]   I don't know why.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.000]   - I see, I don't know why, but I was thinking,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.360]   I was thinking Zuckerberg.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.560]   - Oh, Zuckerberg doesn't.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.400]   - Because of that.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.240]   - Well, I mean, if we're tossing out like famous names,
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.120]   I think it's more likely it's just somebody
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.560]   with a lot of money we've never heard of,
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.560]   but this sort of person would have that kind of hero worship
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.160]   of that generation, also that kind of money
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.840]   where they're not gonna really care so much about them.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.320]   Million plus buttons for a couple of,
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   for a few pages of docs.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.160]   - Yeah.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.760]   - I think, I mean, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.880]   I think that's exactly who bought it.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   I'm starting that rumor right now.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.840]   - I think that's somebody.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.000]   It was Zolow up.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.480]   - I think we've decided, we've all,
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.080]   we've come to a quorum that this is,
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.040]   we've decided that--
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.160]   - This is the Zuck at work.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.000]   - Zuck at work.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   - Zuck at work.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.560]   Either that or Eric's.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560]   - Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.400]   As the head of Facebook, he wanted copies
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.080]   of Steve Wozniak's signature.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.960]   (laughing)
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.680]   We don't have that in his profile yet.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.520]   - Yeah.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.720]   - You know, I'm looking at the documents,
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.000]   Woz signed it, Rom Wayne signed it, both normally.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.920]   Jobs, lowercase, Stephen P. Jobs, all lowercase.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.000]   - Don't know what that means.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.240]   - I'm sure somebody who's a handwriting analyst
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   will have something to say about that.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.480]   - I'm a lowercase guy.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.320]   - Are you?
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.400]   - You signed your name all lowercase?
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.440]   I think that's just perverted and weird.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.640]   - So when I have that.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.000]   - When I actually write,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.440]   I can only write in capitals now.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.600]   - Oh, that's true.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.240]   - Well, that's true.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   - Yeah, we're all hobbled by our lack of penmanship.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.040]   I'm a lefty, what's your excuse?
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.400]   - I just don't use cave walls very often anymore.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   - Those muscles, those fine muscles just aren't there.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.600]   It's like pen, do, do, do.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.080]   - I was testing some new iPad pens, you know,
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.680]   like ones that you can draw on your iPad.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.480]   And I was like, and I was trying to write like,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.320]   "This is a test."
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.280]   And I was like, "What is wrong with this?"
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.560]   And I realized, "Oh, I just don't do this very often."
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.080]   - This is muscles of atrophy.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.800]   I was like, there's pathways in my brain
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.040]   that are just kind of died, you know.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.080]   Apple bumps its free holiday shipping offer
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.600]   up to two to three business day delivery,
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.960]   gets shipped to your door by December 24th.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.080]   This is a change.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.640]   Last month they said they're gonna offer free standard
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.480]   shipping on all orders placed through the US online
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.040]   through December 22nd.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.400]   Apple waving the $50 minimum.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.000]   But now they're saying, no, two to three business days.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.640]   Oh, that's even faster.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.920]   I'm sorry, the free standard shipping is slow.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.760]   Three to five business days is even faster.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.460]   So good, go out and buy more Apple stuff.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:37.040]   Because it's gonna get to you even faster.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.080]   Apple then talks to buy Israeli flash storage company
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.360]   and Obit.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.480]   Terrible name.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:46.680]   Maybe it means something better in Hebrew, I don't know,
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.880]   and Obit for $400 million.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.280]   Maybe even more.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   It's a fabulous semiconductor company.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.840]   That means they design chips, but they don't make them.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.680]   And they make flash chips.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.000]   Apparently the flash chips already from Anabit
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.880]   are already in the iPhone, iPad and the MacBook Air.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.600]   This would make sense that Apple would probably want
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.680]   to own that technology instead of someone else
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.000]   since that's so much other stuff depends on it.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.480]   - It doesn't seem like Apple has just very, very, very
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.200]   slowly becoming vertical.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.680]   You know, it's one of those things like,
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.960]   they just keep on buying the people who supply them.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.640]   Just slowly until they're gonna be like
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.880]   crops arms where you have everything from the mind.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.480]   - We make it all.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.320]   - Yes.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.120]   - Yeah, the iron ore, the lumber coming at Von Anden,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.760]   then the MacBook Air comes out the outside end.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.640]   They all in everything.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   I don't think they use lumber in the MacBook Air.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   Apple's Mac Store breaks the 100 million download barrier.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.000]   That's the desktop app store.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.120]   By the way, Microsoft last week in a fit of NV
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.280]   launched their own desktop app store,
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   which is nowhere near comparable to what Apple's doing.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.240]   They're all Metro.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.240]   I think the minimum price was $2.99.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.400]   It's very strange.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.080]   100 million downloads.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.480]   Is that, I'm just curious.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.000]   So they came out in January.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.440]   I think that's a lot slower than the iOS growth.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.880]   But I have to look at those iOS numbers.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.640]   So it took them almost a year to get 100 million downloads.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.840]   App Store on iOS has had 18 billion.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.840]   - All different in pricing and also on the iOS,
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.120]   you don't have a choice.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:32.960]   - Right.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.080]   Good point.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.200]   Once again, Andy and Ico for the win.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.840]   Have you been to your iTunes lately?
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.400]   They rewind is up the best.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.760]   I have a question for you.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.920]   Let's go look at this.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.960]   This is the best apps, the best music, the best podcasts.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.320]   That kind of thing if you go to the iTunes store.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.320]   But I note on the apps, the iOS apps, number one,
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.680]   and I have to agree, Instagram.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.000]   Number one app for the iPhone.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.600]   Number one, let's see here, I'm in music.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.960]   Let's go to apps.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.160]   Number one game, Tiny Wings.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160]   - Tiny Wings.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.600]   Number one game is Tiny Wings?
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.440]   - I think so.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.280]   - Tiny Tower.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.160]   - Tiny Tower, I'm sorry.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.440]   The Tiny's confused me.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.360]   Tiny Tower, which is even more stupid.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.160]   - I like my game.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.080]   - You like Tiny Tower?
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.320]   - I do, it's got me through its head's moments
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.640]   of a breaking bad.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.920]   It's gonna get me through American Horror Story as well.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.400]   - You're playing Tiny Tower while watching Breaking Bad?
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.320]   - I just farmville with a high rise.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.120]   - It's just very calming and soothing and I like the music.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.360]   - I like the music, yeah.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.920]   - Game of the Year runner up is Tiny Wings.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.440]   The app of the Year runner up VidRythm, I like that,
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.760]   Band of the Day, and Touch Grind BMX on the game site.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.280]   But riddle me this and I'm pretty sure this is the case.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.360]   None of these are available on any other platform
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.200]   than iOS, am I right?
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.080]   Chatroom, can I play Tiny Wings on Android?
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.840]   - Tiny Tower is now available on Android.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.200]   - Okay, I stand, and you know what Touch Grind is as well.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.760]   So I had a theory which was completely wrong
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.080]   that in order to have a chance at being on this list,
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.840]   you had to be iOS only.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.040]   And my theory being that that's why Kevin's
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.480]   system hasn't released Instagram for Android
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.520]   because they wanted to win this, but you know what?
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.520]   I was wrong and I, ow, slap myself.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.040]   For thinking such bad thoughts about Apple,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.240]   they would never do that.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.520]   Do you agree?
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.760]   Any dissent for these choices?
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.120]   iPhone app of the Year Instagram,
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.240]   I think that's pretty clear.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.800]   Although, path.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.640]   - Is that, is that, is it?
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.400]   - Is Instagram new this year?
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.080]   - Oh, that's a good point.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.520]   - Yeah, I think it came out late last year.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.040]   - Just barely came out late last year, yes.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.400]   'Cause I remember my first post was profane.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.760]   And it was like F this stuff.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.080]   - Yeah, and a lot of people got upset.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.400]   - And it went to Twitter 'cause Instagram
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.760]   has a Twitter cross post and a lot of people got upset.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.720]   Including a school teacher who said,
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.640]   I'm making my children all unsubscribed
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.360]   from your Twitter feed, Leo, you son of a bitch.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.240]   So, no, she didn't say that.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.160]   Son of a gun, I think is what she said.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.960]   But Instagram is not this year.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.560]   - So they're stretching a little bit,
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.720]   but other than that, I think that,
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.320]   I feel like Instagram's been around for years.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.760]   I mean, it's just like, it's just like,
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.200]   he says whatever to use it.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.560]   - VidRith and his brand new this year,
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.400]   and really fun if you haven't used it.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.240]   And I don't know band of the day.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:44.280]   - Also, Instagram's a great social community.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.920]   And they should be praised for having built
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.920]   that really popular and vociferous community
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.080]   in just about a year.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.960]   - Is it the most spectacular app though?
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.200]   - It's pretty elegant.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.720]   What would you nominate?
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.960]   - Oh, I'm not even sure what I would have nominated instead.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.280]   It's just that it's, I don't know.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.280]   I, when you look at an app like Flipboard for the iPad.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.080]   - Yeah, that was gorgeous.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.920]   - You had no idea of-- - I think that one last year though.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.760]   Didn't that one last year?
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.000]   - Well, it's a year-old program.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.440]   But I'm talking about something where,
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.320]   when you open up this app,
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.000]   it's like nothing you've ever really seen before.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.480]   It's not just a great app in and of itself.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.240]   It really just demonstrates the iPad in a way
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.760]   that nothing else can really demonstrate.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.400]   - Did you guys talk about Flipboard for the iPhone last week?
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.960]   'Cause that is-- - I believe we did.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.800]   - Wow.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.920]   - Wow. - That's a nice articulation.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.640]   It's not the same app, but when it comes,
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.560]   when you start to shift Flipboard a little bit away
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.960]   from being just sort of a thoughtless receiver
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.520]   of other people's feeds to know this is,
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.200]   we have a central service called Flipboard
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.480]   that keeps track of the things you've read
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.560]   and things you haven't read.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.440]   It's just as important to have something
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.960]   on this device that works.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.560]   But yeah, it is a damn pretty app.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.120]   - It's now how I read my news on the iPhone.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.960]   - Flipboard is really, it's a couple months ago
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.720]   in a very, very touching candlelight ceremony.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.560]   It was awarded one of the coveted Docs spots on my iPad,
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.720]   a change that I've not made in about a little less than a year.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.560]   - Yeah.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.080]   - I love it on the iPhone.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.160]   In fact, you can tell what I love
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.880]   from based on my front page on the iPhone.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.920]   These are the Apis days day in day out
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.320]   and Flipboard with its iPhone app
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.920]   immediately moved to the front page.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.440]   Just fantastic, fantastic.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.840]   - I know on my iPad, the Flipboard
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.560]   and on the iPhone version is amazing.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.640]   - I'd like to even bet it's in the iPad version
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.480]   for some reason.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.880]   - I just like the fact that I can hold it there
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.240]   and do it while I'm flipping these up at the airport
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.960]   or whatever and I don't have to pull anything else out.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.800]   - It's really great.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.080]   - It's beautifully designed.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.400]   - And I've been waiting for, I mean,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.800]   almost since it came out.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.480]   You immediately wanted to have this on your iPhone.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.000]   - So you already talked about it, so I won't.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.680]   But I would bet that's the app of the year
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.040]   for the iPhone next year, although path is awfully nice too.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.760]   - Speaking of winners and losers,
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.760]   the number one book on Amazon for the year 2011 is...
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.960]   - I don't even need a drumroll.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.080]   Steve Jobs, Biography by Walter Isaacson.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.240]   Not a surprise.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.600]   I bought three copies myself.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.560]   - Bit of a surprise in that.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.840]   They only had like two months to get to that point.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.680]   - Well, that's a good point.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.960]   - So man, that's my need to finish the Titanic seller.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.440]   - Best seller of 2011 in two months.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.520]   - So they all want to zip-beat the damn vampires.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.720]   That's all I was caring about.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.520]   And as long as the vampires lose, we all win.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.200]   And zombies.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.120]   And zombies.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.000]   Zombies, they're on the bubble.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.480]   I'm still okay with the zombies.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.800]   It's the vampires that must be crushed.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.720]   (laughs)
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.120]   You can even show me a really good,
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.440]   well-written vampire story.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.040]   And I'm like, please, no more vampire.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.280]   - Really, I feel that way about zombies.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.160]   I love your making me think about the Twilight Twinkly vampires
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.240]   when you show me a good vampire.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.680]   - See, I'm in rice all the way.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.720]   - That's a vampire.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.560]   - I don't know who these.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.400]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.240]   I don't know.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.080]   - That's how bad it is.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.040]   - It's stealing the goodwill from the hard-working vampires
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.080]   of literary history.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.760]   The ones who just pack a lunch,
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.720]   they are doing the job week in,
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.360]   week out, expecting nothing in return,
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.280]   except for sustaining blood.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.280]   - What does a vampire pack for lunch?
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.680]   - True blood.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.520]   - Children.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.600]   (laughs)
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.440]   - Mall children.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.280]   They're more poorly.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.600]   - I felt like I had to bait you guys.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.600]   I wasn't gonna say it.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.760]   (laughs)
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.680]   - Apple New Campus will put on a spectacular show every year
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.680]   starting on Steve Jobs' birthday.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.160]   We're seeing more and more details about the spaceship
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.800]   and the Cupertino.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.120]   It's a beautiful building.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.760]   In late February, around the time of Jobs' birthday,
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:55.760]   pink and white plum blossoms will appear.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.240]   By the way, Apple didn't make this happen.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.320]   It actually is nature.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.720]   - Yeah, I was about to say,
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.800]   this is something like Kim Jong Eels like press for the,
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.160]   I was gonna say, the glorious leader has caused the flowers
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.000]   to bloom in celebration of his birthday.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.920]   - They did plant a lot of cherry trees though,
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.400]   and plum trees.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.760]   - Yeah, I was agreed to let the fruit trees be pollinated
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.280]   this year so that we can all enjoy rich,
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280]   luscious fruit.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.120]   - Visitor's.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   - All hair.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.640]   - The celestial leader.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.960]   Visitors arriving for a new product introductions
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.800]   on Apple's camp.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.640]   I didn't write this.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.240]   This is straight out of Forbes.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.440]   Visitors arriving for a new product introductions
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.840]   on Apple's campus will walk down a path lined with cherry trees,
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.120]   the white blossoms contrasting with a dark green conifers
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.720]   behind them, a sight that by April should be absolutely
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.840]   staggering.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.680]   They must, this is, if you think we had a slow news week,
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.920]   Forbes must have had a really slow news week.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.120]   - It does make me think, I wonder who's the first
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.720]   like pair of Apple employees are gonna choose
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.240]   to get married on the Apple campus.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.720]   - It seems like they're gonna need to have a policy
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.840]   for that because you know that they,
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.640]   if there are people who have already decided
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.320]   I'm gonna plunk down $250,000 for a ride on spaceship one.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   You gotta think that there are people
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.040]   with an Apple who have already said,
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.560]   we don't want to build anything.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.240]   We don't want to let people in.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.000]   We just want, during our lunch break,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.520]   we can have our friend, another Apple employee,
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.760]   signed in as a justice of the piece for the day
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.040]   and just get married underneath the factory.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.240]   - I don't wanna get married there.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.680]   That sounds beautiful.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.880]   We promise to take all the wedding photos with our iPhones
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.320]   and you can use them all during the big keynote next month.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.160]   Are you showing off?
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.640]   - I'm with IOS version three.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.880]   - I do remember when Jobs pitched this
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.640]   to Cupertino City Council, he talked a lot about,
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.320]   we were gonna add, there are gonna be more trees
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.520]   here than there ever were before.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.920]   And of course, the heritage of that area is as prune orchards
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.000]   in that particular area.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.800]   Apple employees, again from Forbes,
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.960]   will enjoy gardens, a fountain,
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.800]   an open air amphitheater,
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.600]   and a dining terrace nestled among Apple orchards,
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.840]   a grove of apricot trees and stands of plum trees.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.360]   Cherry trees will be dotted throughout.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.240]   - We will also be planting 4.8 miles
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.720]   of 18 foot high picket fencing
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.800]   so that none but Apple people can gaze upon this beauty.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800]   - Well, I think it is inside the ring.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.720]   So you gotta be literally in the circle of trust,
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   if you wanna see the trees.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.720]   - This is a little bit like Marie Antoinette saying,
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.360]   I hope that all the peasants appreciate how wonderful
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.560]   this solid gold bed I sleep in every night is.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.160]   It is truly a wondrous bed, the finest craftsman
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.320]   of all of France went into its construction.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.920]   It's funny that you should say that.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.480]   Two days ago, I was gazing upon Marie Antoinette's bed.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.560]   It's very sigh.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.080]   - How was Marie? - You can try.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.640]   - I did not try it.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.120]   You know, you're the bed.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.520]   - Hey, hey! - Whoa!
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.400]   - A lot of people tried.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.240]   The bed, both Louis and Marie Antoinette's beds
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.200]   are public chambers and they have a ballast rod,
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.480]   you know, like a railing so that the courtiers could stand
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.440]   outside the railing and watch the king and queen sleep.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.920]   But as far as I could tell, the bed was not solid gold.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.360]   A lot of, you know, it's very deceptive.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.120]   It's all gilded wood.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.960]   Just saying.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.560]   - Hey, by the way, how was Louis?
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.480]   - Oh, I didn't mention Louis.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.080]   Well, we'll mention Louis and then we'll get to our iOS picks,
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.800]   our picks, all of that stuff.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.760]   Hey, Louis was great, Louis LeMure
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.160]   and his wife Geraldine put this together every year in Paris.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.760]   And I hope you saw some of our coverage.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.480]   Among others, Apple people will be interested in an interview
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.600]   that we did and is now on our Twitch specials feed.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.440]   Is that right?
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:53.440]   Jean-Marie Hullau, who was CTO at Next and later at Apple.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.360]   And in fact, I asked him and he said, he confirmed it.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.760]   He was the guy who in 2001 said to Steve Jobs,
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.480]   "You know, you will be doing an iPhone."
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.840]   Well, I don't think he called the iPhone,
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.240]   but you will be doing a phone.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.720]   You will have to do a phone.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.280]   And Jobs, he told me, Jobs said, "No, come on,
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.600]   "Jean-Marie, you're kidding me."
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.120]   And he said, "No, you will have to."
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.520]   And later they, I think that that time
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.600]   they may have started work on it.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.120]   Jean-Marie Hullau was, there is,
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.840]   there's the interview you can find at twit.tv.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.040]   His current project is something called Photopedia,
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.640]   which is kind of a Wikipedia for photos.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.680]   It's very cool and looks great on the iPad
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.520]   and on the iPhone, so I recommend it.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.120]   But he also said that he, when he first came to the US,
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.280]   lived with Steve Jobs for many months.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.520]   And I tried to get him to say something bad about Steve Jobs
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.360]   and he would not.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.280]   He said, "You know, I never had to work with him as a manager.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.680]   "He might have been difficult to work with as a manager,
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   "but he was a great friend and a really impressive intellect,
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:54.480]   "I believe," he said.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.040]   It was hard to tell he was speaking French.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.400]   So, Jean-Marie was very interested.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.920]   But we had a lot of great interviews.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.760]   It was really fun.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.240]   We had a studio off to the side.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.360]   And a lot of very interesting people came through,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.480]   some great startups, a lot of iOS stuff.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.320]   And I think that, you know, there were a number
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.160]   of big announcements.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.920]   I think the web is increasingly going to be
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.120]   an important, one of the key important conferences,
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.640]   we'll probably go back again next year and cover it again.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.280]   But, path, Flipboard's phone application,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.960]   Evernote announced two new applications.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.920]   Spotify made a big announcement,
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.440]   which we haven't mentioned,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   but they're going to start doing radio, Pandora style,
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.560]   radio and the Spotify app,
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.840]   which I think is going to be a very important feature
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.480]   for them going forward.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.560]   Daniel Ek was there from Spotify.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.400]   Of course, all the news went to Google's Eric Schmidt,
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.160]   who announced the half of all TVs sold in 2012
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.920]   would have Google TV in them.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.200]   I don't know why there wasn't
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.160]   Rokus Laughter in the audience when he said that.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.000]   They were very respectful.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.560]   It was sort of like a James Bond villain style threat.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.800]   I don't know what the idea was.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.000]   Later, later, later.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.680]   I could protect the other half from Google TV.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.440]   There was a lot of deposit, $8 trillion.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.560]   Later, Google's PR people said, well,
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.360]   what did they say?
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.680]   They couldn't, there was no-
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   There was a lot of silence when he would say things,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.040]   and then people would just go, huh?
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.720]   And there'd be like faint applause.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.560]   Ah!
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:23.280]   Well, the French are known for their sanguine dispositions,
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.120]   very calm.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.280]   They're drinking before 10 AM, so.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.240]   Oh yeah, they were.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.400]   Wine, this is the best thing about Lueb.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.840]   They serve an amazing meal all the time.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.200]   There's food, and there's wine all the time.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.120]   There's coffee and wine the whole time.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.440]   So it's a great conference to go to if you want to get sloshed.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.560]   Bloshed and hyper.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.560]   And caffeinated.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.240]   Lot of wide awake drunks there.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.320]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.200]   No, it's a great conference,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.800]   and I really want to thank Lueb and his team,
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.280]   'cause it was a lot of fun,
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.120]   and they invited us there to cover it.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.960]   And because of the time difference,
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.240]   all of our coverage was here,
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.240]   was like 5 AM to 9 AM Pacific.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.760]   So probably a lot of people didn't see it,
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.080]   but you can go back on twitter.tv
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.880]   and see all of the interviews.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.200]   Yeah, there's three specials.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.360]   Three specials.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.760]   And then did we put the Kevin Rose interview
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.960]   that we did with Sarah Lane?
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.880]   They're within the special.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.600]   In the special, that's the one on stage that we did.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.280]   Yeah, and also her interview with Airbnb.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.120]   Airbnb and your interview too.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:19.960]   With Lueb.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.800]   Okay, good.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.640]   They're all there.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.200]   Yeah, so well worth seeing if you haven't seen those.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.000]   Twit.tv, or it's in the specials feed
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.040]   if you subscribe to them.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.240]   We're gonna take a break when we come back.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.240]   iOS, Lion and Tips, and Picks of the Week as well.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.760]   But first a word from our friends at Ford,
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   when I got to the parking structure,
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.240]   there I noticed some new Ford vehicles up there.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.080]   We got a Fiesta, a Focus, and who has the Mustang?
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.000]   I didn't see a Mustang.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.120]   It was a Mustang, yeah.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.000]   There was a white Mustang.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.040]   Did Lisa or Tony take the Mustang?
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.480]   Oh no, he glisted it.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.360]   Liz already took it.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.120]   2012 vehicles.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:57.960]   We're gonna test drive them,
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.880]   and of course the Ford Sync, we wanna,
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.880]   and my Ford Touch, we wanna really,
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.240]   what we're doing, and tomorrow and the next day
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.720]   we're gonna get in the cars with cameras,
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.560]   and we're gonna get video of all of this stuff.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.600]   So, you know, one of the things I felt kind of bad
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.760]   when we do these Ford commercials is me talking,
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.680]   or I send you to the webpage, we wanna show you.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.040]   So we're gonna actually shoot some video in there
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.400]   to show you the amazing Ford Sync.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.120]   Like the Sync services, which I don't talk a lot about,
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.520]   but I love, you get personalized alerts
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.640]   for weather, sports, news, stocks, even your horoscope.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.040]   Personalized traffic alerts,
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.560]   if you take a regular route, it will tell you
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.680]   when you get in the car, don't go that way.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.040]   When you get low on gas, it shows you gas stations,
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.080]   you can even find the best gas prices.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.440]   All of this is there in the Ford Sync.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.640]   You press the button and you can ask it, movie times.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.240]   It's, if you have the in-dash display that's available,
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.200]   but you can also just have it read to you as you drive,
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.320]   or even, and this is new, mine doesn't do this,
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.840]   they will text you with this information to your phone.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.040]   If you wanna know more about this,
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.760]   go to Ford.com/technology, and if you are a Sync user,
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.680]   so maybe this is, I gotta go to the site,
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:08.760]   Ford.com/Sync will let you personalize those services.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.960]   This is all available in the new 2012 Ford Focus,
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.960]   which we have, and there's one waiting for me.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.320]   I took a picture of it and put it on my path,
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.600]   and my four square, can't wait.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.440]   I'm excited.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.480]   Ford.com/technology to learn more,
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.760]   and we thank Ford because I've been invited at CES
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.800]   to go to a dinner.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   I'm so excited with the CTO Ford,
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.160]   and it's CEO to talk about what they're doing.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.320]   I will come back and let you know
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.720]   some very exciting stuff coming from Ford.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.040]   They are a high tech car company, great cars,
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.520]   great cockpits, I wanna call it a cockpits.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.560]   Ford.com/technology.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560]   It is time.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.600]   I have given you as much time as I can, Alex Lindsey,
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.720]   for an iOS tip.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.120]   There he is with his iOS device.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.960]   So one of the cool things about the new,
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.200]   with the iPhone, where iOS 5 is that you can,
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.720]   of course, take pictures with your volume button.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.400]   But one thing that people don't know
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   is that you can actually use the volume button
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.160]   on your headset.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.000]   So if you're looking for something where you can tether it,
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.200]   so a lot of us, when we change this photography,
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.640]   you might wanna be able to put this on a tripod,
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.360]   or be able to have it in one place,
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.760]   and be able to fire in another.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.400]   And so you can actually have it tethered firing
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.240]   from your iPod.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.080]   I'm not gonna take my headset out
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.320]   'cause the headset that I'm using right now
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.560]   is the one you're, let's do.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.080]   So, but if you actually put your headset in,
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.280]   and you have volume buttons on the headset,
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.840]   the Civil Automotive Cam has that.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.640]   This is something you can actually just use the volume button,
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.840]   and it'll take a picture with your iPhone,
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.840]   which is kind of nifty for those of you
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.240]   who always wished that you had tethered photography
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.080]   on your iPhone.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.440]   That's actually a kind of neat surprise, right?
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.400]   That that works.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.240]   I love that.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.600]   You can hide your iPhone somewhere,
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.000]   and then you can be sitting somewhere else,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.880]   and you can take a picture of, you know.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.480]   - There's, by the way, there's the focus
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.400]   that I'm waiting for.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.880]   Here's a picture on my, let's see, that's gonna be nice.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.960]   Ooh, look at that.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.200]   You're just-- - Is that a slick?
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.040]   Yeah, I wanna get that for the week.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:12.880]   - Well.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.120]   - And then if I could slide over, which I can't,
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.720]   because the iPhone hasn't yet developed
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.040]   that 360 degree photography capability
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.720]   that'll be in next year's iPhone,
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.080]   I could show you the other cards,
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:21.920]   they're over there.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.360]   - I think it would be really great
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.400]   for many of the hosts on your show.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.560]   (laughing)
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.960]   Alex, if you were here, you know what?
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.440]   You're just not here, dude.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.080]   If you were here, you would be, in fact,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.480]   we would be putting you in one of these cars,
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.600]   'cause Brent, we're gonna put Brent by in the backseat.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.960]   He's gonna do what they call a French over, right?
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.800]   Isn't that why they call it?
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.640]   - Right.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.480]   - You're gonna wanna say--
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.320]   - All right.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.160]   - Hey.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.000]   - It's way after dark.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:43.880]   (laughing)
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.000]   - No, that's where you see it all the time.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.320]   In the guy with the cameras in the backseat,
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.560]   shooting the driver like that, it's called a French over.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.640]   And we're gonna do French over,
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.000]   so if all of the staff,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.120]   Eileen, you're gonna do what I hope,
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.720]   and you could show how it works with an Android phone.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.800]   - Yes.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.560]   - And so forth.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.400]   But anyway, we're gonna do that,
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.400]   that's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.880]   - So I think if no idea how those cars
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.680]   would handle a New England winner weather.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.040]   - Wouldn't you like to know?
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.920]   If only there's like a solution for that.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   All right, I'll talk to Ford.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.360]   Which one do you want?
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.120]   The Focus, the Fiesta, the Stange.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:16.960]   You know what I like?
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.440]   - The things with--
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.520]   - For you?
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.320]   - Yes. - For all-wheel drive?
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.320]   - The beautiful flex.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.120]   I love the flex.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:25.960]   It's kinda-- - It's also one over.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.800]   I'll see what I think about it.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.640]   - Yeah, I will say one over.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.440]   You can see what you think about it.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.160]   - You're lying tip, Mr. Not Cool.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.240]   Actually, this is a Mac OS tip.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.760]   One of my favorite sort of like submarine features
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.680]   of a utility that not enough people are using.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.960]   If you have ever, of course,
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.440]   had your Mac keep track of your passwords for you,
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.240]   you have been unwindling using an app called
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.960]   a utility called Keychain Access.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.520]   And if you go into the utilities folder,
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.560]   you can actually launch the app.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.800]   You can look at all your keychains.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.720]   Obviously, all these secret passwords have been stored.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.560]   Normally, it just works invisibly.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.000]   But it really is a very, very cool app
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.840]   just for securing, for storing all kinds of secure information.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.600]   One of the features that it has built in
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.520]   is the ability to store secure notes.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.080]   Where you can just type any text you want,
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.720]   and it will be just ungodly well encrypted
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.040]   and protected by your Keychain password.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.840]   So I use it all the time because obviously,
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.160]   this Keychain file has all kinds of passwords.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.160]   And if I get for all the different services that I use,
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.880]   and so whenever I need to move from one machine to another,
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.840]   I don't need to reprogram the new Mac with all my old passwords.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:38.520]   I can just copy this old password file Keychain file
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.360]   to the new one.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.520]   But it also means that if I need to know
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.520]   what's the number of my current insurance policy number,
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.720]   what's the address of this place that people need
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.160]   if something got forbidden happened to me
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.120]   that they need to get access to this?
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.160]   Things that aren't necessarily passwords
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.120]   or information that's being controlled by Keychain access.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.880]   But I need to have a secure place to store it
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.120]   so that I know that if someone were to get,
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.280]   if my Mac were to fall into the wrong hands
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.480]   or somewhere to steal it out of my house,
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.120]   they wouldn't be able to get access to all that information
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.480]   without either this really stupidly long password
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.520]   I have attached to it,
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.520]   or without even be able to simply open the file
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.360]   and take a look at it manually.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.240]   Also, it has now obviously Keychain access,
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.800]   sorry if you're saying the word obviously twice,
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.280]   I'm trying to stop myself from doing that.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.800]   (laughs)
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.840]   Keychain access isn't the only app out there
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.320]   that's used for, that can store information securely.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.440]   The big advantage of it though is that it is an app
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.240]   that's going to be on every single Mac that you own
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:36.240]   for the foreseeable future.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.200]   So if two years from now, three years from now,
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.680]   four years from now, you come across this old file
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.400]   of what you know to be very, very secure
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.680]   and very, very important information to you.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.800]   It's not as though you're going to have to find
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:54.080]   a two year old copy of an app that they stopped making
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.800]   a year ago to try to open it and get access
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:57.720]   to this information.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.000]   You will still be able to simply open up this Keychain file
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.560]   with the current Mac you have,
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.760]   with the car operating system and get access to it.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.960]   So that's why I tend to use it as my one,
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.620]   as my go to place to store information securely.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.360]   I love Keychain access.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.880]   I completely agree with you.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.440]   In fact, this is where I store my vera sign certificate
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.000]   for digitally signing email and all sorts of stuff.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.760]   It really is a kind of a brilliant technology
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.460]   that's been OS 10 since the beginning, I'm sure.
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.120]   - We should do a bit on it.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.800]   For instance, you want your Keychain access password
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.520]   to be the same as your login password
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.480]   'cause then when you log in, it will automatically unlock it.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.920]   But if you do change it, if you want more security,
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.280]   you can actually have a secondary request for a login.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.240]   I mean, there's all sorts of nice features.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.600]   - Yeah, it also has a really cool password generator
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.760]   that I use off all the time where you just press a button
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.600]   and you just tell it what kind of a password you want.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.800]   Do you want something really, really secure,
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.640]   just a little secure?
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.480]   Good, okay.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.480]   Do you want something that's memorable
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.720]   or something that's not memorable?
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.760]   And it will give you two nicely hashed English words
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.640]   that kind of go together.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.160]   That makes it very, very easy to remember
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.000]   this really complicated password that you can come up
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   with yourself but definitely exists there
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.560]   and it will be stored inside the Keychain
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:16.120]   so that if you do forget that your bank accounts password
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.880]   as KJLLRFO101.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.400]   If you go have that, those 43 letters don't come
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.280]   tripply off the tongue.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.000]   You can always go back and get it.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.720]   - This is, I think people don't know about this
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.000]   and it's fantastic.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.320]   - Watch the app, poke around it
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.800]   and you'll find a lot of cool features
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.120]   that you might want to use for this your life.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.520]   - Yeah.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.360]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.320]   Great OS10 tip.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.880]   And now ladies and gentlemen, it is time
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:42.600]   for our software picks of the week.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.880]   Would you like to start Mr. Lindsey?
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:45.720]   - Sure.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.880]   So I'm in Tokyo.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.040]   - Yes, yes.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.800]   - And so I felt like it was important to possibly look
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.520]   at an app that we've been using here to get around.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.800]   So there's a, I have a lot of subway apps
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.800]   I tend to kind of collect them.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.960]   And this is a great one.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.680]   It's called Go Tokyo.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.760]   And it's like a little guide
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.520]   and it's just on your iPhone, it's like $3.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.360]   I got the Go Tokyo Plus, of course, which was,
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.200]   it's so funny that you, the Plus is only $3.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.640]   I think the Go Tokyo is free.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.040]   And what it does is it gives you,
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.960]   some people will use a taxi in Tokyo,
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.240]   but if you do, you're crazy
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.680]   because the train system here is probably one
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.040]   of the best in the world.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.440]   And so, but the key is just to know where you are
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.000]   'cause these stations are huge.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.080]   And you have to know, so that you have,
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.280]   you can search for stations,
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:34.480]   you can, you've got a train map, a station map
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.000]   and the station maps are important
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.840]   because if you're in Ginsa, you have to know,
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:40.160]   like there are a whole bunch of ways to get out.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.120]   There's a whole bunch of other lines that are going through
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:43.120]   and you gotta know which, you know,
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.360]   how to get from one to the other.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.920]   And this gives you these great little maps
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.480]   that are on the wall here and there,
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.760]   but it's great to be able to sit there
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.440]   and actually figure it out on your phone
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.360]   when you're in the train, you know.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.920]   - I have to say, I always, whenever I travel,
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.440]   will download the same thing in Paris,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.360]   just as you did, I will download all of it.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.840]   There's always great apps for that kind of thing.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.840]   - Well, and what's, Americans, you know,
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.200]   pay a heavy price for being so car-centric
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.400]   because it is such a, it's so awesome
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.040]   to take trains all over the world,
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.200]   whether you're in London or Paris or Japan.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.760]   Not only can you get around really easily and fluidly,
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.120]   but you really get a feel for the culture.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.560]   Every subway system really tells you a little bit
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.760]   about the culture that you're in,
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.720]   the way that it's set up and the structure
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.000]   and anyway, and this is just a really great little application
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.360]   that makes it a lot easier to get around Tokyo.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.600]   And if you're ever in Tokyo,
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.800]   definitely don't stay in a hotel,
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.120]   get into the subway system.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.680]   You can get so many places so quickly and so inexpensively,
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:50.080]   but you definitely need an app like this
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.120]   to make sure you know where you're going.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.320]   - Yeah, wow, that's great.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.520]   500 stations, 13JR lines for private,
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.200]   we're always go Tokyo, 299 iPhone or iPad.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.080]   We're with every penny.
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.960]   - I used a DK's, has some great guide books,
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.640]   and there's a top 10 Paris,
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.360]   there's a big one for the iPad,
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.920]   if you're carrying an iPad with you,
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.400]   but the top 10 Paris is great for just like,
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.520]   and it was all the places we were visiting,
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.640]   I would just look in there and lots of good information,
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.040]   but not the Metro, there's a separate app for that.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.520]   - And then I have a whole bunch of Metro ones,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.040]   this one, this Go Tokyo was suggested by Leon LaHua,
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.040]   who is one of our producers, so she's here.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.440]   And so I was trying to figure out what she was,
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.000]   she was like doing this crazy rain man,
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.160]   she just knew where everything was,
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.320]   while we were going and found it.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.680]   - I know what everything is.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.680]   - What are you using in the Go Tokyo?
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.520]   - There are, you're right,
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.760]   there are a ton of Paris transit guides.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.080]   - Yeah.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.960]   - Holy cow, holy cow.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.040]   Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.160]   - This is a really cool app for the iPhone,
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.440]   that someone introduced me to the other night
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.720]   when we're out to dinner at a really, really nice restaurant
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.840]   and the really, the difference between really,
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.600]   really nice restaurants and say five guys burgers and fries
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.520]   is that five guys burgers and fries,
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.840]   they basically illuminate it with like magnesium,
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.520]   not magnesium lance, but open fires of magnesium.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   - No, you're right.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.200]   - So it's sort of this sort of lighting that says,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.120]   eat and get out, we need the tables.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.880]   This is a lovely restaurant where it's very, very dark,
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.320]   subdued lighting and no one could read the menus,
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.760]   except for someone at the very, very end of the table
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.040]   who was using a really, this really cool iOS app
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.640]   called Lumen and what it is,
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:33.000]   it's a digital pocket magnifier.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:33.840]   - Wow.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.680]   - I've got it running here.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:37.080]   All it does is it turns on the camera
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.600]   and it's not just a, it's not really a camera app,
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.680]   it's just designed so that you can,
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.760]   it will just simply, you can just use it
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.680]   as a regular magnifier.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:49.760]   I've got a DVD case here text so that,
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.200]   why isn't, oh God, it was focusing and that was not.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.040]   I haven't been switching in, other it is.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.480]   And so not only that, but you can also turn on the light,
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.360]   not only that, but once you've got basically the bit of text
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.680]   you wanna really take a look at,
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.400]   you can then tap the lock button
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.960]   and now it's like static on the screen.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.120]   So now you can basically zoom in
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.200]   and actually take a closer, closer, closer look
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.360]   at this tiny text that you can't see correctly.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.280]   So there, as a, I'm sure that this is an app
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.680]   that I'm going to be making more and more use of
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.280]   as my life goes on.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.120]   Oh, by the way, you can also email,
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.520]   you can also use this as a camera,
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.760]   you can also send that picture elsewhere.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.360]   But as time goes by, I'm sure that I'm gonna be using this
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.040]   more and more, but even today, the number of times
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.440]   when I need to, I'll take out like some sort of like
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.440]   device that someone sent me and I don't have the power
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.040]   adapter nearby and so I have to look at the back of it
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.800]   to just find out what the power requirements are.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.000]   I'll find that this, this copy decided it would be really,
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.200]   really funny to put that information,
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.600]   print that information in 50% gray lettering on top
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:04.600]   of a 25% gray background at like two microns high.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.400]   And that's the situation which I really am glad that I,
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.640]   I would really be glad that I have this app with me.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.640]   It's only a buck 99.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.720]   It's definitely in that category of buy it now
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.840]   without any intention of every, every using it.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.560]   And I almost guarantee that sometime in the next
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.120]   three or four weeks, there will be a time where you'll just
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.120]   like any of the time in life you're thinking,
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.320]   ah, dang it, this is too small to, oh, wait a minute.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.320]   I have that app.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.720]   What was it called again, loom something?
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.560]   Oh, there it is.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.400]   Hey, now we can read it.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.920]   Aren't I a stud?
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.320]   Although it'd be you saying it, not me.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.000]   - Yes, I am gonna say that.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.960]   Aren't you a stud?
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.800]   - Thank you very much.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.840]   - That's great, I'm downloading it right now, fantastic.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.880]   I have two picks, one a note for people who were
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.200]   programmers or used text editors,
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.840]   there was a great one for many years called Textimate.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.520]   It was designed in conjunction with David Hennemire-Hanson,
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.560]   who was the developer of Ruby on Rails.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.840]   It was a really great Ruby programming environment.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.000]   And then it just kind of disappeared for a while.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.840]   Good news, Macromates has put out a beta of version 2.0.
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.760]   It's not bad yet.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.680]   You can get it at the Macromates website
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.920]   if you're a registered text mate user, which I am.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.880]   So there have been many good choices kind of in response
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.440]   to the disappearance of Textmate and its creator,
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.640]   but good news, it's back.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.040]   So if you are a text mate,
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.640]   use your mic, I wanna check out the alpha.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.080]   As they are quick to point out, it has lots of bugs
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.240]   because it's alpha, but it's certainly good news
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.640]   for people who've been waiting for a new text mate.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:40.640]   And my other pick is from a guy who's gonna be with us
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.480]   in just a few minutes.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.080]   Trey Radcliffe is here in studio to join us for a Twit photo,
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.040]   one of our favorite people in the world.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.600]   Forget photography, just one of the greatest guys
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.440]   in the world.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.520]   And we've plugged this on iPad today,
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.880]   but I think I should mention this on this show.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.720]   Last month, Trey came out with a new app.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.920]   He has a number of great apps for the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.480]   This is an iPad app that's absolutely free.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.520]   We were talking about travel.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.800]   It's called Stuck on Earth.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:11.520]   Beautiful, beautiful photographs from all around the world
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.880]   and some very nice features.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.600]   And apparently if I log in with my name,
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.040]   I'm gonna find some special Easter eggs on there too,
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.360]   but I know my iPad in front of me,
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.360]   so I'll just have to take that for granted.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.560]   But Stuck on Earth from Trey Radcliffe,
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:27.160]   he's the course Stuck on Customs.com.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:31.000]   And just some really nice stuff, it's free.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.800]   And you can put your own save trips,
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.600]   local maps, descriptions, and more into it.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.840]   But there's lots of content that it comes with
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.160]   to begin with.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.000]   Trey is just one of my favorite photographers in the world.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.880]   So a couple of recommendations there for you.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.480]   Well, we are at a time, but I am so grateful
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.800]   that Alex, you got up at five, four in the morning.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800]   (laughs)
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.200]   It's now six in the morning and you might as well stay up.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.640]   'Cause I missed you guys.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.160]   Your day has begun, my friend.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.000]   Yes.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:01.840]   Oh, I got lost.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:02.680]   You're today already.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.400]   So I'm so sorry, but I do appreciate
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.480]   you being here for the show.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.640]   We missed you.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.480]   It's my pleasure.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.920]   Hey, and by the way, next week,
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.360]   I am doing a webinar on live streaming
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.640]   since I do all this live streaming.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.160]   You are the king.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.000]   And it's free.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:16.840]   It's free.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.440]   It's filmmakingwebinars.com
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.240]   and you can do a search for live streaming
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.920]   or Alex Lindsey and you'll see it there on their website.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.760]   So, but definitely check that out.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.600]   It's free.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:27.680]   All you gotta do is register.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.080]   It's actually a go-to webinar.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.960]   And so I'll be walking people through some of the basics
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.240]   if you're trying to think about how to do this
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.240]   for whether it's your school or your company
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.360]   or you know, you want to turn it.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.960]   And you think this might be a good business for you.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.000]   I'm just gonna kind of give you an overview
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.600]   of the things you have to think about to do that.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.720]   One M or two in filmmaking webinar.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.120]   It's one M.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.200]   Nope, it's two M's.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:54.760]   Film making webinarsplural.com.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.760]   And right on the front page,
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.640]   they're introduction to live streaming, Alex Lindsey.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.480]   So definitely check it out.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.120]   Register and come join me and it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.400]   He's already, Alex has already,
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:04.720]   has taught me everything I know about streaming,
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.520]   including, by the way,
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.720]   I think we're gonna have to buy an elemental.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.560]   Oh man, they are so awesome.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.840]   Wirecast has been crashing on us every day.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.280]   Our stream dies once a day now.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.480]   We have to restart.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.720]   So I think we're gonna buy one of those boxes.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.120]   Has it been good for you?
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:20.960]   It's been great.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.800]   You know, we use both of those.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.680]   So we use Wirecast,
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.600]   we're using Wirecast today actually for the stream.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.440]   There are certain things that Wirecast has
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.320]   that we use, you don't use, but we use,
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.840]   which is being able to add extra slides at the end
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.880]   if there's, you know, things we're doing transitions for,
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.120]   switching entire pipelines in the back end.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.560]   And so there's a lot of flexibility
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.000]   that we get out of Wirecast that we love.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.080]   But as far as a, you know, a big heavy iron
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.400]   when it comes to streaming,
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.120]   the elemental is pretty amazing.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:49.960]   So we like it.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.160]   - At that price, it better damn well be.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.480]   (laughing)
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.280]   - I got my checkbook out.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.720]   - Yeah, it's not $10, but it's,
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.600]   if you're doing a lot of streaming,
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.320]   and you just want something that is, you know,
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.680]   once again, you get to a certain point,
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.480]   we got to a certain point where we just had to start.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480]   - We have to have it.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.320]   - And some iron.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.640]   - Yeah.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.720]   - So that's what, I guess that's what's in our future.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.960]   - It'll be a great Christmas for Leo
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.080]   and his whole family when they find an elemental
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.440]   under the tree and nothing else.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.000]   (laughing)
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.240]   - Not a good Christmas for his friends and relatives,
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.000]   all who will be getting a donation has been made
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:29.840]   in your name.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.760]   - A gift to the twin elemental.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.200]   A gift to fun.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:34.040]   - To streaming.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.880]   Andy and I go, thank you for being here all the way
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.640]   from Bast in Massachusetts.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.000]   Andy writes for, of course, the Chicago Sun Times
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.720]   where he is the king of the hill,
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:44.840]   and it comes to technology.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.840]   You can also find him at cwru.com.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.680]   - Yup.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.920]   - And his review of the Kindle Fire.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.840]   All positive, well, mostly positive.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.720]   Kind of positive, sort of positive.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.680]   - Thank you guys for being here.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.520]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.440]   Thank you all for being here too.

[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.080]   In fact, it's fun if you watch live.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.680]   You get there's a pre-show and a post-show
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.760]   and there's lots of swearing that we edit out.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.880]   But then for the clean family-friendly version,
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.720]   except for occasionally when you went to a Bum re-ent
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:20.960]   to an end, you couldn't get the download available
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.360]   at twit.tv as well.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.400]   In fact, subscribe.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.680]   There's audio, there's video, the whole thing.

[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:34.920]   Break time's over.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:45.240]   (upbeat music)
