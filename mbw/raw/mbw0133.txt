[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.740]   We all go to talk about Apple stuff.
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.780]   In studio with me today, I'm very happy to say I, Justine.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.680]   Justine, Justine Azeric.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680]   Good to have you here.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   Yes, I'm excited.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.420]   Whenever Justine's in town, she makes her way up
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.120]   the long Highway 101 corridor.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.020]   It's a long drive.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.820]   It is a long drive.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.460]   I thank you for doing that.
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.620]   You made Dadein do it.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.960]   Yeah, he drove.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.900]   Also here, Mr. Andy Ennaco in Mule's workshop.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.800]   Hello, Mule.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.000]   Hello.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.500]   I'm old Mule.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.740]   I'm a trademark character that will soon
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.400]   become the latest internet video sensation.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.740]   Now, we've yet to monetize the Mule concept,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440]   but I'm offering all the sponsors of this show
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.980]   to come on board onto the ground floor
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.480]   and allow me to upgrade from the no-name baloney
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.320]   to the store brand ham at the Deli counter.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.780]   That's really the goal for the show.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.220]   You also need to go to educate and form entertainment.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.120]   Cheer with the cheaply.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.020]   Boy, I'm tired of generic stuff.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.920]   He's doing it for the boars head.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.860]   Well, that's not in the quarter one, actuals,
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.760]   but we're hoping by second year profitability.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.300]   Also with us, Mr. Scott Borne.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.500]   Hello, I just don't have anything to compete with Mule's
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.840]   workshop, but I am wearing my Hawaiian shirt
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.980]   in celebration of the sixth day in a row of a high here
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.580]   in Gig Harbor of 41 degrees.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580]   Oh, man, it's cold.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.880]   Oh, man, how do you do it?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.180]   Well, when I went to the bank yesterday
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.420]   wearing the typical Tommy Baham, a uniform,
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.720]   the bank teller looked at me and said, you're optimistic.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.420]   [laughter]
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   The ever-optimistic Scott Borne.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.160]   So, kids, what's in the news?
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.760]   I haven't noticed a lot of Mac stories.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.460]   What's going on?
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.060]   Times of Mac.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.760]   It was times of Mac news.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.560]   Well, you know what?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.900]   I think everybody, despite how you may or may not feel
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.000]   about this, the Mac heist thing tonight at 8 p.m.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.300]   is a big deal.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.540]   Well, I was interested to see the name brands
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.440]   that they've got doing that.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.140]   They've got at least--
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.040]   Seems like a betany Veronica and Chris Perillo
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.140]   hosting that tonight.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.840]   Like, it's some sort of award show.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.540]   I have no idea.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.140]   I got the email.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.040]   I was like, what is this?
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   Well, I didn't ask you.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.840]   I don't know, but it looks very cool.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   Have you done-- you did the Mac heist thing once now?
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   No, I never have.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.680]   No.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.420]   So, what is it that they do, Scott?
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.380]   You know, Mac heist is--
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.020]   we don't know.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.620]   This is the first time they've ever done something quite like this.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.220]   They're going to do it live on the internet
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.800]   and such a way that everybody's going to find out
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.260]   what the bundle consists of.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.760]   But we all know how they kind of work.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.300]   They bundle a bunch--
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.200]   That's Phillip for you is a hell of a marker.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.800]   Oh, it's an incredible marketing system.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.340]   He's made this a massive story.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.940]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.240]   Even though it really isn't--
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.840]   they're announcing what their bundle's going to be.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   Yeah, here's the thing.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.180]   It's marketing 101.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.920]   Anticipation and things that lead to urgency and exclusivity
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.520]   are triggers for almost every human being.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   We all want something special, unique, powerful.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.160]   So, this is a wonderful marketing point.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.460]   And I have to say that looking at past bundles,
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.600]   there's some good deals now.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   The real controversy, of course, comes
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.900]   because some people don't feel that the developers are getting
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.700]   paid enough.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.600]   However, the developers are all over 18,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.140]   as far as I understand, in making decisions of their own free
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.140]   will to participate.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.240]   So, I say Bahambug.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.540]   Yeah, a year ago, we spent a lot of time talking about this.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.780]   We talked to some developers who thought it was a bad idea
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.380]   for developers, particularly Rich Segal of Bearbone Software.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.020]   And then, the week later, we had Phillip and some of the others
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.420]   from Mac Heist come in and a couple of their developers.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.720]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.220]   Well, aren't the apps only available for a certain time?
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.120]   So, then after that--
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   No, they're supposed to be.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.360]   Well, see, that's an interesting--
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.860]   You mean, are they like limited editions?
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.760]   I'm not sure I've never really participated in the high--
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.060]   I think they're full versions.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.160]   I mean, I think they're full versions.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.500]   Oh, yeah, they're full versions.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   Aren't they just available for download or purchase
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.000]   for a certain limited time, correct?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.340]   Well, what they did last year is you bought a bundle, right?
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.280]   And the bundle gave, you know, for a $69,
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.540]   you got hundreds of dollars worth of stuff.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.440]   And what you have to do is look at what the bundle is
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.740]   and are there programs in there that I need
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.480]   that I would buy otherwise and we don't save me money?
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.380]   The problem is it's kind of a hodgepodge of stuff.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.720]   You know, there's some interesting stuff,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   some stuff that's less interesting.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.420]   I think, Justine, is your question,
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.760]   no, that doesn't last forever.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.460]   I mean, you have so many days to buy.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, like it's a limited time offer.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.960]   Yeah, of course.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.060]   I mean, if people like these apps,
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.760]   like I think it's a great promotional tool
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.200]   for a lot of these developers who otherwise wouldn't
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   get their name out there and nobody would even know about it.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.700]   And they're doing a, you know, I mean,
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.000]   they're basically piggybacking on really good marketing.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.440]   You know, I mean, that's the key to the whole thing.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   Look at this.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.240]   Join us live.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.880]   It's if you go to Mac heist.com.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.540]   Join us live.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.880]   If I were Perala, I'd be a little hurt
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.680]   because they've got Lisa and they've got Veronica.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.080]   I don't see a picture of Perala there.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.120]   He was on the email.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.420]   Yeah, no, I know he's going to be there.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.060]   But in the web page, they only show,
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.620]   "Away, maybe he's underneath this thing."
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.420]   Okay, I got to get rid of it.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.420]   I see.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.620]   They've hidden his face under this drop down.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.620]   Aww.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.420]   I can't get the drop down off of Perala.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.220]   I'm pretty sure that's Perala under there.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.720]   Yeah, he's under the drop down.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   He's under the drop down.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.620]   It looks like a teaser for some sort of like a new sci-fi
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.460]   female cop show on the FX channel or something.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.360]   Yeah, I mean, they're really selling this.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.660]   The bundle reveal show.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.760]   That's funny.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.860]   But then, you know, haven't they been doing?
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.500]   I know Lisa's been doing it.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   I know Lisa's been like every week.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   They come out.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.900]   She comes out with instructions about doing something.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.500]   And so, you know what?
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   It might be, I think they might have made it
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.100]   a little too complicated.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.100]   I watched the first one.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.100]   I was like, "I don't have time to follow this.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.100]   This is you, my man."
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.100]   You can overplay that stuff.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.000]   And many people do.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.600]   But we'll see how it works out.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.000]   Definitely a cool idea, though.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.500]   I just don't-- I mean, it's like QVC.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.100]   I mean, why am I going to tune?
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.100]   Tell me again why I'm going to tune in to watch
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.600]   them reveal what products they're going to sell in the bundle.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.100]   I'm sort of at the point where I have to make sure
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.600]   that I'm outside doing something other than tuning into this show.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Because at a certain point, okay, maybe I'm curious.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.200]   But when it gets to this level, I'm just, you know what?
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.100]   Your punishment is that I have to be-- I have to be doing--
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   What is the opposite of watching this show?
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.200]   I've had that with TV shows, too, where it's like,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.800]   you know what two and a half men has just gotten across the Terminator
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.100]   from simply bad to actively annoying.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300]   And I need to-- It's the opposite of John Cryer.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.500]   What is the opposite of--
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   They even have a dashboard countdown widget.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.700]   And I--
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.800]   Okay, now it just got set.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.400]   It's just like, who's doing this?
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   I mean, okay.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Who's doing this?
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   That's crazy.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.800]   There may be a new computer in this bundle.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.700]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.300]   Yeah, $12 for a new computer.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.500]   But maybe, I don't know.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.800]   Works like a lot of publicity.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.200]   It's working to some degree because I got, you know,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.400]   four or five dozen tweets about it saying,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.500]   "Hey, be sure to talk about this on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.000]   We're excited about this."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.200]   From them.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   These are just from my regular followers.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.200]   Really?
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.000]   I even got several emails and I don't ever remember
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.300]   even signing up for it.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.900]   Uh-oh.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yeah, I haven't received any-- I haven't received anything from them.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.800]   Well, I got press emails, but I think that's just normal press release.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.100]   It's yours where they says, "Consumers like..."
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.100]   That's not good.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.400]   Uh, and the underscore DAVE_, for instance,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   just sent me a tweet saying, you know,
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.300]   "The big reveals tonight, Eustre, mate, PME eastern."
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.700]   They must have some multi-level marketing scheme going here.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.100]   Somebody's got a lot of friends coming.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.300]   How do they enlist people to do stuff like that?
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.800]   That's...
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.800]   Well, I'm going to do a search.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.300]   Let me do a search on Mac Heist and see if somebody...
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.700]   Also, they're counter-programming it against idle.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.000]   I don't know if that's a good idea.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   Even Fox moved house to Monday nights for, you know,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.700]   screen that season.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.800]   I mean, I really shouldn't be...
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   I love house.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.500]   I shouldn't be mocking this since, in fact, I did watch...
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.600]   I did watch "Dancing with the Stars" again last night.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   It was.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   And I'm going to watch it again tonight.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.700]   So there, it's working.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.800]   I spent many more hours watching this crap than I'd ever want to.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.700]   I definitely agree.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.200]   I've never...
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.300]   But you have to watch live.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.800]   I've never watched "Dancing with the Stars."
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   Did you not watch it?
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.800]   Well, I don't have actual cable, so I mean, I watch it post.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.500]   But...
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.800]   So you have to watch live.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   Because you can only vote for the half hour after the live show.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.600]   I mean, I still voted for him, but I couldn't watch.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.500]   But you only have half an hour after the live show.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.600]   Oh, so you just voted for him without seeing him.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.800]   I mean, I sure he did great.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   I mean, you already have heard...
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.000]   You guys ever tried Tebow Leo?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   You can't Tebow.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.100]   No, you don't... You don't... You don't...
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.200]   If you want to vote...
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.000]   No, you can Tebow it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.800]   But then you have to vote with us.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   That's a cool...
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   You just have to somehow remember what kind the show ends are.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.000]   I mean, if we're not for the Marvel's adventure
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.700]   of Dr. Antonio V. Fast Forward button,
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.900]   I would not be able to watch this show at all.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's like, if I have to watch 90 minutes...
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.700]   Oh, it's horrible.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.700]   They dance, and then there's 18 minutes of commercials,
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.700]   and then they give you the results,
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.100]   and then there's 18 minutes of commercials.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.300]   That's the most painful...
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   I want to be on this show.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.600]   I want to dance with the stars.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.900]   You should be a dancing...
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.500]   Can you dance?
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.900]   Not dance at all.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.900]   Like, it's embarrassing.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.600]   Really?
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.200]   Yes, it is atrocious.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.300]   Well, what's weird is that...
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.100]   I was actually beat Belinda Carlisle to survive to the second round,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.800]   which is like...
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.500]   I mean, she's in the go-go's.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500]   Like, she should be able to dance.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.300]   I can't believe this.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.800]   But she was, in fact, fairly wooden.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.400]   Did you watch?
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:43.900]   She didn't watch.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.700]   I didn't know.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.100]   I watched the first thing he was on.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.000]   And you know...
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.700]   Our friend Steve created some controversy
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.600]   by slamming the show's producers
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.100]   and then backing off and apologizing.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.100]   Does he apologize?
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.900]   He did.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.200]   Because he was a miffed,
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.000]   because he felt that the votes...
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.900]   They were paying no attention to the internet votes.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.700]   Well, they never tell you what the internet votes are.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.400]   They only kind of imply that there's some internet voting going on.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.300]   Make sure you vote.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.700]   They don't charge you, at least.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.400]   Like, idle those.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.500]   I know it all 13 times.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.400]   I do too, both times.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.100]   And it's easy because we have AT&T phones,
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.900]   because we have live phones.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.100]   So you just press, you know, type vote.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.500]   You have to type vote 13 times.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.900]   You can vote on your phone and online 13 times.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.900]   Yeah, and you can email.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.700]   Oh, really?
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.300]   I mean, you can email.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.400]   Yeah, they take email too.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   Oh, jeez, that's an awesome...
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.000]   She calls.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.900]   You can text, you can email, and you can call.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.800]   But I don't...
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.300]   I have to confess to never having voted on any of these things,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.200]   because I think that the...
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   This is my first final...
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.000]   The final winners are already picked.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.300]   Well, this is what Woz was saying.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.200]   He said, "They wanted us, Belinda Carlisle, and me to be in a day..."
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.500]   They wanted me to be in the dance-off at the end of the show,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.000]   because it would be good for ratings.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So they ignored what I believe was an internet vote tally
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.700]   that protected me from any chance of being in the dance-off.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.800]   You know, I don't even want to make it.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.200]   This is the rules, or labyrinthine and Byzantine.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   I think Woz should win.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.200]   Woz says that the producers don't tell you the votes.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.800]   They ignore the votes because they really want to stack it the way they stack it.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.600]   And this will be...
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   You know what? This will be the test.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.800]   If Woz's theory is true, he will survive tonight,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   because he shouldn't have survived the first night.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.700]   He really is a dancing tele-tubby.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.800]   He does not.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   That's what the Italian judge called him.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.900]   And it's true.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.000]   In fact, at the end of his dance, the second dance he did,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.600]   he lands on the ground with like a thunderous...
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.100]   It's like Scott, if you were I did this, with this thunderous boom,
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.200]   he like falls on the ground and then goes up on his elbow and goes...
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   Ha!
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.400]   And it was like, oh, that's awful.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.500]   It's a belly flop.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.100]   I love it.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.500]   There's a guy someplace who's got a list of 7 million things
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.300]   that's going to happen to me in my life, and that's not on the list.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.200]   Oh, man.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.400]   Yeah, you'd never catch me doing it.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.500]   But if you wanted to do it, Justine, I think we would see to it that you won.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.800]   That would be a lot of fun, but I'm telling you, I can't dance.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.600]   Well, this is a big step forward.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.300]   I mean, they have now...
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.900]   They've had a first...
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.800]   Their first geek.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.300]   I would imagine next season it'll be the Internet celebrity.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.500]   And who's a bigger Internet celebrity than I just did?
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.700]   Why did an article because there was Twitter.com/votewas.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.500]   And I think votewas.com, they have like the whole website dedicated.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.800]   And they interviewed the guy that did the site.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.500]   And he said that I should be the next dancing with the stars.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.100]   Well, he's in our chat right now watching.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.300]   He's obviously a fan.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.400]   I don't know which chat he's in, but I'm told that he's in our chat.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.200]   So hilarious.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.000]   Well, why should we settle for less than the best?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.500]   We should put a team on the Amazing Race.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.900]   Now, that's the reality show.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.900]   Oh my gosh.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.500]   Oh my gosh.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.900]   You keep it loose with your dignity with air.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.600]   That's the greatest show ever.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.900]   And we could win that because we're geeks.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Just because I can do the part that involves nothing but sitting behind the computer, I'll go.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Well, no, see, Amazing Race is exactly right for people like us because the people who fail like for the first three shows
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.200]   and the people who don't read the directions.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.800]   Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.500]   We are the people on tech support who said, OK, and so I suppose you did shut down before installing.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.900]   No, that important.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.200]   Yeah, that's actually step two in the instructions.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.900]   It won't work if you don't read if you don't shut down before you install.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.800]   What?
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.000]   Wait, we were supposed to we were supposed to walk from here to the checkpoint.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.800]   Yes, as indicated by step three that said, walk to the checkpoint.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.900]   Well, I'm watching tonight.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.400]   I am watching tonight because this is so this is how they get here.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.500]   This is really a ball.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   This is terrible.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.200]   I can barely again.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.000]   I love was and I want to see them and and I do DVR and watch it like on DVR.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.900]   But I can't do this for two nights, man.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.700]   This is such an awful show.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.900]   It's how it's a horrifying.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.300]   And they get you for two nights again money and Tuesday because they should they do the dancing Monday and then Tuesday.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.700]   Someone will be voted off.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.300]   It's it they draw this thing up a Paul.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:58.100]   This is this is the sort of show that would work great in 1974 where there were only three channels and no ability to record anything.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.100]   Well, we all vote vote for was tonight, right?
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.600]   Was over was that's really all there is to it.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.900]   Did I vote last night?
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.900]   I forgot to vote.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.300]   Oh, you can still vote online.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.500]   What kind of I can vote for half an hour noon.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.200]   No until noon you can vote.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   So ABC.com everybody get there.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   Okay, I'm going to vote.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.500]   Go it gets like go.avc.com. That's the other thing.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.200]   These guys get you know you cannot remember the URL.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.400]   You have to Google dancing with the stars to get their website is so pathetic.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.000]   They can't you know could you get dancing with the stars.com.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.100]   No, that would not be a corporate within commensurate with our corporate policy.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.100]   It's like ABC dot go dot prime time dancing with the stars.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   But what is ridiculous?
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.200]   I just want to vote.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.100]   So where do I vote?
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.100]   No, geocities.com in there.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.000]   It might as well.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.700]   All right.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.100]   All right.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.200]   All right.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.100]   You guys would you take over the show because I got a.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.600]   All right.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.900]   Story number two.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.200]   Get ready to get irate.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:06.400]   Steve Balmer says Steve Balmer says the tide has turned against Apple in the computer market.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.000]   Speaking of the conference in New York.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.400]   On March 19th, Steve Balmer was asked about the momentum, the big Mo.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   That Apple has experienced in the desktop and notebook computer market.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   We've got the proof.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.900]   We've seen the results.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:26.000]   The Microsoft CEO quickly jumped in to correct that impression, alluding to more recent data showing apples growth taking a hit.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.900]   Then he said something.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:32.700]   That could single handedly re-fan the flames of the Mac PC rival.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.800]   Are you ready kids?
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.200]   What voice should I use for Balmer something really annoying?
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   Apple like go ahead.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:40.700]   You do it.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.300]   You do it.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.200]   Apple gained about one point.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.300]   But now I think the tide has really turned back the other direction.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.300]   Balmer said via webcast.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.900]   The economy is helpful paying an extra.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:17:01.300]   Oh, this is the Microsoft the Apple tax of Microsoft's been hitting the paying extra $500 for computer in this environment.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   Same piece of hardware paying $500 for more to get a logo on it.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.200]   I think that's a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.500]   Microsoft spokesmen is repressually saying we're sorry grandpa got access to the computer.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.600]   When you went to the computer.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:26.900]   So remember that we talked the other day about the fact that Bill won't let Melinda have an iPod or an iPhone or an iMac.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.800]   So business we can have a turkey vomit zoom anytime.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   Yeah, well, exactly.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.500]   Business Week's editor in Chief Steve Adler asked Balmer if he owned any Apple products himself.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.700]   A secret iPod maybe.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.400]   No, none.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.000]   I don't.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.600]   My son's my wife does it.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.000]   Iron liar pants on fire.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.700]   You're talking to a guy though whose dad worked for Ford and once Ford sold Land Rover and Jaguar, we're selling the cars to get fords.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.800]   So you may have a weird outlier in me.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.500]   Those poor deprived children.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   That is pretty pretty harsh.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.400]   I understand he uses Microsoft live search for all of his searching to he never uses Google at all.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.100]   You know that would be a that would be a curse to have to use Microsoft live search all the time.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.900]   I love this.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:18.300]   Listen, I know some of the people Microsoft and surprising it's surprising to me some of them are brilliant.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.800]   Some of them are really cool.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.400]   Some of them are really trying to work on very, very cool stuff.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.200]   They don't get the credit.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   They deserve that said there ain't enough money in the Microsoft treasury to get me to be an all Microsoft guy.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.000]   Well, how about being an all Apple guy?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.100]   Are you an all Apple guy?
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.900]   Well, that's just that's just because that's the way to be.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.200]   Okay, it's funny actually Intel.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.800]   They sent me a delta test out.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.200]   Yeah, I really I felt like I just entered this whole new world.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.600]   Like I mean, I really like it.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's pretty quick, not going to lie, but it just I could never go back.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.600]   Is it running this stuff?
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.400]   What's that?
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.200]   Is it running this stuff?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.500]   Yes.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.300]   Well, then that sort of seals the deal, doesn't it?
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.100]   I mean,
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.700]   you guys are such bigots.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.000]   Let's just say I'm a Mac user for life.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.100]   We're just going to put that out.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.200]   You know, wait till you see Windows 7, Windows 7 is not so bad.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.500]   I'm running it on MSI Winden on a Dell.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   Here's my favorite part of Mac break weekly where we defend Windows.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.600]   Well, hey, the Windows guy defends Mac.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:31.700]   So here's the thing, I know that you you have to deal with a lot more Windows people than Mac people because the radio show.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.900]   I mean, let's face it more people own Windows and Mac.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.400]   But I hear this.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.300]   I've known you for a while and I hear this frequently like, well, wait till Windows 4 comes out then they're really.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.900]   That's true.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.000]   And never goes through.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.700]   And that's going to Windows 6 Windows 7.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.800]   That's going to be the ticket.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.900]   We'll be hearing this from you when it's Windows 39.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.500]   I brought it really.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:20:00.000]   I think I think it was seven is is is is the first version of Windows that a Mac user would like.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.900]   That's my that's my supposition.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.800]   We'll see if I'm right.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.700]   I really want to try out.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.100]   What was it?
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.740]   It was the Microsoft Word Smith, the thing that you you say this tune,
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.500]   song Smith song Smith something I'm not sure.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.000]   Yes, you need Windows for that the weirdest app ever awful, but you need to you need Windows for that.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.900]   I want to try it.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.100]   So I'll be writing my review on that too.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.700]   Isn't it funny?
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.200]   It's like, well, you need if you want to run Final Cut Pro, you need a Mac.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.400]   But if you want to run song Smith, you need Windows.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.800]   You do.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.500]   There you go.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.700]   And see in the commercial they used a Mac for.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.700]   They just covered it up.
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.400]   We won't tell anybody though.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.100]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.300]   Has anybody seen that new Adamo or a game?
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.600]   It's a person, but the Domo the pictures are beautiful.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.400]   It's basically it.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.500]   Is that designed to be an air killer?
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.600]   Yeah, I would say so.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   It's $2,000, a little more than the air.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.100]   So my question is why would they do that given the fact that air sales are so slow.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.300]   Yeah, well, I don't know.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.900]   Once the air starts heating up and getting warm by doing anything, it's just it's useless.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.800]   Yeah, this is more powerful than an air.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.400]   It's a little bigger.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.500]   It's a little thicker.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.600]   It is metal.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.700]   Brushed aluminum.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.800]   It's a lot where they call it a luxury laptop.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.200]   What it is, I think it's an acknowledgment by Dell.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:22.600]   Contrary to what Steve Balmer says that there is a market for still today.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.900]   There's some taste for more expensive luxury higher end computers.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   So they're looking at they're looking at Apple's market.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.000]   I don't know if their air is specifically the air, really maybe more aimed at the Mac book.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.800]   Pro market.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   It actually looks kind of nice and looking at it right now.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.700]   It's beautiful, isn't it?
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.100]   Wow.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.300]   Yeah, Dell's been talking to me about this for a few weeks now and they're supposed to be sending me one soon.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:56.000]   It really there are people who don't like plastic and there are people who don't like big gaps in the in the in the design where the battery doesn't quite meet the rest of the body quite quickly.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   So I don't think it's I don't think two grand is a ridiculous amount of money to spend for a notebook with real performance and that's really going to be the difference if they're essentially selling a nine hundred dollar laptop for two thousand bucks, which in some ways is what Apple was doing with the air.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.100]   They're selling a basically a thirteen hundred dollar Mac book, nothing for two grand.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.000]   Then might be a pretty nice machine.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.800]   I'm looking forward to getting it.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.800]   Domo, A-D-A-M-O by Dell.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.100]   It's the place and you see how they're selling it.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:28.300]   They're selling it with models and you know, very fancy artistic type of people.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   It says prepare to fall in love.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.900]   Discover.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.600]   I thought that's it.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:42.300]   Yeah, that's a great message for these tying economic times when P7,000 people show up for 12 firefighter jobs.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.200]   Well, but that's what Apple's doing too, isn't it?
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.200]   I think Apple's toned it down.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:56.300]   If you look at the new commercials, they're more like, for instance, touting individual aspects of the product line, like its green nature going away from the luxury stuff.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   I don't think they've ever really so much touted the luxury side as they have, you know, internally said, well, we do try to make higher end products, but I think anybody that's going with a purely luxurious style marketing campaign in this economy is going to get a little blowback.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.100]   Well, I think we're just seeing part of it.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:21.900]   I mean, this isn't as ridiculous as I think the ASOS has a line of Lamborghini notebooks.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.600]   Yeah, so see you.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   That is ridiculous.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.200]   It has a, you see the Ferrari Lamborghini.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.700]   I think it's Lamborghini, whereas they make a big point of how it's the exact same Lamborghini paint.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.200]   It's got the Lamborghini badging and it's this ridiculous amount of money for this notebook.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   That looks kind of cool, but it's essentially a yellow notebook.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:49.300]   If they again, it depends on if there's performance, if there is an aspect to owning this notebook that goes beyond a, hey, look, I got a cool looking notebook, then they're in there with a shot.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:24:04.500]   I mean, remember that one of the things that we all love about Apple is the fact that they do believe that a beautiful object can be the beauty of a design can in fact be a feature of a piece of technology that's not just flash over substance.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:19.500]   The fact that it is this slim and you can hold it in one hand and carry it around with you from open from office to office and put it inside the newspaper pouch of your notebook bag and not have to fill up the main compartment actually makes it more portable, more accessible and therefore more useful.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.500]   It is more like a MacBook Air speeds that are slower processors.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:30.700]   It probably has more slots because it's, you know, more more connectors because it's, you know, it's Dell, but.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   But for a lot of people, I mean, that's all they need.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.000]   Looks like ethernet, HDMI through.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.400]   Yeah, I mean, USB ports.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.700]   I'm just not willing to slap Dell about this again.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.300]   It's weird that.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   Exactly the same timetable last year, a couple of weeks before this conference in Colorado, Apple let me the MacBook Air and within two days, it's the concept sort of failed on me because I just could not make use of a one USB port computer.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.400]   When I'm out there for an entire week and I've got pictures coming in, I've got videos coming in, I've got all kinds of storage problems.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:18.600]   And at the same time, so at this same time of preparing this little mini this Dell mini nine netbook and convincing myself that maybe I can actually leave my regular MacBook at home.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.900]   I can rely on this $350 notebook for the entire week simply by virtue of the fact that it has three USB ports.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.000]   I'll have no problems.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.200]   You know, the keyboard is a little bit small, but I can take my cheap, dinky little full size keyboard for when I'm back to the hotel room and typing.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.500]   Seriously, I have no problem dumping all my photos from my camera and my videos and that sort of stuff.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.900]   So like I said, the proof is in the details.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:49.000]   If this is a perfectly nice, useful little sub-skinny netbook, then that might actually work out fine for Dell.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.400]   I just want to jump in real quick, though, and say, you know, it's 2000 bucks.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   I have friends at the professional photographers of America watching us right now.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.000]   Hi guys.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:07.200]   If they're going to spend 2000 bucks, those people are going to spend it on a MacBook Pro so they can do some Photoshop, some aperture, stuff like that.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:16.900]   I think that the MacBook Air is a little overpriced, but certainly it's going to be an easier sell if that's the area you're in 17 something versus, you know, 2000.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:25.300]   I am anxious to see how it competes just because I think anything that does compete forces Apple to take a longer look at what they're doing, which is a good thing for us.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.500]   I mean, I love traveling with my air, but honestly doing photos video.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.500]   I mean, it won't work.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.900]   It's like pulling teeth and it overheats and then I have to just kind of give it a little break.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.200]   Yeah, it's slow.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:36.800]   That's not good.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.400]   Traveling it.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.300]   Mine doesn't.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   Mine doesn't overheat.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:46.500]   I love it for what I use it for, which is strictly if I'm going to be on a trip where I just want to send email and browse websites and write.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.200]   Then I don't care.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.600]   I feel bad because I sent Abby to France with one and she's complaining about the overheating.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:52.900]   Really?
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   But she doesn't even mind that overheated.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.700]   If you're actually doing processor intensive, get one of those little, I think, Belk and has little cooling USB heater or heater.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.800]   You put it under.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.900]   It's got three fans on it.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.400]   It plugs into the USB sits under the laptop.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.500]   That probably make a big difference.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.600]   It makes a huge difference.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:15.100]   It's got a USB little hub so you can not use your only free port to call your laptop.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:22.500]   We've got more stories, including the 320 project, which I think is kind of interesting and more.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.200]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our sponsor, GoToMeeting.com.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.100]   Now on Mac, if you use GoToMeeting on PCs, you'll be glad to know that you can actually start a meeting now on the Mac.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.200]   You could always be in a meeting on the Mac.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.900]   But now they actually let you start meetings on Mac and Tush.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.900]   GoToMeeting is that great software that lets you hold meetings wherever you are.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.000]   You know, you can start the conference call.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.200]   Say, wait a minute.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.400]   I got to show you this.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.800]   Go to GoToMeeting.com.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.900]   No matter what computer you're using, here's the meeting ID.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.100]   You enter the meeting ID.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.300]   You're in the meeting.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.900]   Suddenly you're seeing the PowerPoint where they're seeing the keynote.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.000]   You're seeing the websites, the drawings.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.200]   You can even collaborate together, even if you're on different kinds of computers, you can collaborate together.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.700]   It lets you travel less, get more done, close more sales.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.700]   Great for training, great for collaboration and now free for 30 days.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.700]   I want you to go to GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.100]   These are the folks at Citrix. I know them well and they really do great stuff.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.500]   GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.100]   If you've tried other online meeting software, perhaps you're just a little frustrated.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.000]   I don't blame you.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.100]   I've tried some of the others.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.900]   They're awful.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.800]   GoToMeeting makes it very easy to set up, very easy to use.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.600]   One low monthly rate.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.700]   So you don't have to worry about the number of meetings or how often you meet or how long you mean.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.000]   I mean, go toMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.300]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.900]   No obligation.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.800]   Just see what you think.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.300]   Maybe you should have Macbreak done over GoToMeeting and invite a few hundred thousand of our closest friends.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.200]   And see that thing.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   You know, I've really been trying to think of ways I could use this in the production of a show.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.800]   And I've given lectures with GoToMeeting.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.100]   I had a couple of hundred people in a room and given talks and that's worked pretty well.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   So I don't know.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.100]   Do you think they could handle an audience our size?
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.100]   I don't think so.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.600]   Even on this stream on the video stream, there's 2300 people watching.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.200]   I don't know.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.700]   That's a good question.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.700]   We could do the famous Macbreak weekly.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.900]   What websites did we take down this weekly?
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.700]   Let's not take down our sponsors.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.300]   Actually, take it down right now by going.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.800]   Let's everybody go to GoToMeeting.com/Macbreak.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.100]   Nice.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.400]   Anyway, that's a pro.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.200]   There you go.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   And we think we just didn't want you to have to like think this was going to be an easy spot.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.500]   I want to hear from your buddy.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.800]   Yeah, no, no, never is with you guys.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.300]   That's fine.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.900]   I like it.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.600]   No, I like it.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.200]   I like the peanut gallery.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.100]   Go to me.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.800]   The fire is expected not to burn out until tomorrow.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.600]   And if you're burned out by high prices,
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.800]   head on to the Berlin geese Chevrolet Palace on Route 13.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.900]   That's why Paul Harvey would always and I kind of respected this.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.900]   He'd always say page two and then he'd launch it to the commercial so that you know,
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.900]   he didn't do those those segues, right?
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.100]   Parach to.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.600]   Yeah, but the problem is he did it so fluently.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.100]   You still didn't still thought it was.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.100]   So I think I think the problem was that was actually printed to the bottom of the page.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.000]   He's just writing.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   He just read it.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.700]   Hammer mill bond.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.000]   Twenty wait away.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.100]   But sorry.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:25.600]   Sorry.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:32.900]   So any thoughts now that we've been living with the iPhone 3G for a week,
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.900]   anything that we missed last week that you've noticed that is a big story.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   So the story is coming out that the AT&D did it again,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.300]   leaked some information confirming my suspicion that there'll be a new iPhone in June.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.500]   You've been saying that.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:48.800]   Yep.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.700]   They're also selling an unlocked version for what was it?
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.300]   699 and it's not it's actually not unlocked.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.100]   It's it's just that there's no contract.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's still locked.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.800]   A.D.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.500]   So how crazy is that?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.600]   It's just that it's just that you don't have a contract.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.000]   Right.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.600]   Wow.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.100]   Wow.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:14.800]   So so essentially what you're saying is that you get the privilege of buying your and paying for your entire to your contract in advance.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.700]   Wait, no, it's not the.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.500]   Okay.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.800]   Maybe not paying for the entire car.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:27.900]   But how many months would you have to have it before you would and drop it before that would be cost effective, like five, six months on a $60 month minimum AT&T contract?
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:32.400]   I think 699 is pretty steep, but maybe that's closer to the real unsubsidized cost of the phone.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.500]   I mean, that's the point, I guess, is that well, we subsidize it because we're going to get you for two years.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:44.900]   But if you do if you the thing is, Andy, you still got to pay if I mean, what's the point of having it if you're not going to use it and then you pay the 60 bucks a month somebody.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.900]   If you better.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   If it would make any sense whatsoever for someone where they need to have an iPhone for the next four months because they're in this network or they're working on this project or whatever.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.900]   It would now make sense if you need it for only eight months after which you stop using it.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:06.400]   I mean, what I like about unlocked phones from other carriers is that they are willing to they make it a very, very simple transaction saying, well, the reason why.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.900]   We're selling you this this this Windows mobile phone for a hundred bucks is that we know we were getting a contract out of you.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:18.500]   If you're willing to pay us the exact cost of the phone, we're willing to sell it to you so that you can use it on any carrier and the price can be kind of steep.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.900]   I mean, I did I paid like something like a hundred and fifty hundred and eighty dollar premium on my Windows mobile phone a couple years ago.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:29.400]   But the advantage is that when I'm in London, I can just pop a sim in it and actually use it with whatever is going to be convenient.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:37.900]   That is a good thing and I mean, honestly, like I AT&T is okay, but actually making phone calls, especially to other AT&T customers.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.400]   It's it's like a chore.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   But you get a lot of dropped calls now.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.900]   I'm getting a ton of drop calls.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.400]   It's getting worse.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   I mean, half the time I turn off 3G just because I feel like it's usually switching back between edge.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   Oh, you think that's what's going on? Oh, I feel like it.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   And then it's been a little better now that I switched just to edge.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.900]   I had to turn off Wi-Fi because the battery life sucks again.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   Yeah, it's they made it better with 2-2 and then they made it worse again.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.400]   No, it was like overnight.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.900]   My phone would be dead.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.900]   I'd even have a plug didn't.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.400]   It would still die.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   It's like, is this possible?
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.900]   Because it was better, right?
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.400]   Am I?
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:09.900]   I'm not imagining this.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.900]   No, I know because I even tweeted about it not too long ago.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.900]   The once I did the update, my battery life was.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.400]   They fixed it and they broke it again.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.900]   Yeah, you know, it's very strange.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.400]   I'm always interested in these stories because I'll hear people from who people who I respect.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   So I know like are no dummies and they're having horrible problems.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   And then I'll look at my own experience where I'm not having any battery problems.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:35.900]   It's the problems of switching from 3G to edge are usually a regional problem.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.400]   But, you know, I'm in Metro Boston.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   Maybe it's California.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   I don't know.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   And I have a.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.900]   Do you make a lot of calls with your phone, Andy?
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.900]   That's the rub.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   I've tried to lead a basically my phone line is sort of a spam filter.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.900]   If you call me instead of email, you fail.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   That means that you don't know me very well and I'll have to really recognize that area.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.900]   So you wouldn't experience the drop calls because you're not on the phone a lot.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.900]   Oh, that's true.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:01.900]   But I do.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   But I do use the 3G and the edge enough that I really do notice when I'm suddenly on an edge account
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   or when I suddenly don't have access to the digital network.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.900]   That happened to me once last week for no apparent reason.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.900]   But.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.900]   And I don't know if that's the same problem or different problems.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.900]   And you didn't notice a change in battery life going from 2 to 2 to 2 to 1.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.900]   No, not at all.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.900]   I definitely did.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.900]   Oh, I did.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.900]   And I'm using the original iPhone and I'm still getting like all day long battery life.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.900]   No problem.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   Well, there's no doubt about it.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.900]   The original iPhone had better best battery life.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.900]   That's interesting.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   You wouldn't expect that.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.900]   I know.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   I'm never going to upgrade that chucker.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.900]   Well, there's no hardware coming.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900]   It looks like.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.900]   So what else about 3.0 if we learned in the week interviewing?
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.900]   Anything else that.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.900]   There's support for video in there.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.900]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.900]   Well, you know, this is the digging for buried treasure thing that people do.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   They look for screens and there's a video screen.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   Well, the big deal is that tethering is absolute just like they said last week.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.900]   Tethering is definitely in there because people have actually gotten it working.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.900]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   And it's a full feature.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.900]   It's not like, oh, well, there's a hidden thing where if you tweak this and adjust this setting,
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.900]   then you can write an app that supports tethering.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.900]   No, there is actually a just like you pulling down on a wall sconce in the castle.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.900]   The wall spins around revealing the laboratory.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.900]   If you if you change something to a configuration file, suddenly there's a brand new panel in
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.900]   the operating system that in the networking preferences that says tethering on off on.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   Okay, cool.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.900]   You're tethered.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.900]   Good.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.900]   Wow.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.900]   I'm excited for search in mail.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.900]   Yeah, finally.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.900]   The actual, you know, logging into Gmail on the web just to try to search for a phone number.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.900]   Right.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.900]   That's been a real pain.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.900]   That has actually bothered me.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.180]   Mostly I just use it as a phone.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.300]   I do occasionally want to rely it on as an email, you know, provider for me.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.540]   And I do wish I could search better and I have to go to the web version of Gmail to find
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.900]   stuff, which is kind of a murk.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.540]   Well, it's the search has two really cool things about it.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:09.140]   Number one, without anybody really knowing it, we finally have our improved application
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.540]   launcher that we've all wanted because it works the same way that spotlight does on
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.540]   the desktop.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.940]   I know that I want to launch a Tweety and but it's some somewhere buried on page four.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.660]   I can just simply tap search for TWE and it'll show up and you can tap it and launch
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.660]   it.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.780]   But I want to know though is if developers can write their own plugins to support the
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.540]   search, if it only supports apples built in apps and only on the terms that apple decides
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.380]   that it's going to be supported.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.980]   That's not as cool as simply saying, I know that I made a note to myself about a diner
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.220]   somewhere in Northampton.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.860]   A diner in Northampton.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   Oh, yes, there it is.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.060]   It's a tasks manager and here's where I put the address.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:51.300]   Also, and this might be super geeky, but the guy Joe Hewitt who did the Facebook connect
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:56.620]   for the iPhone and the Facebook iPhone app, which is quite a nice app, has released a
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:03.420]   library called the 320 project because it's a 320 pixel screen wide that people can use
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.500]   to create their own iPhone apps.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:11.020]   It has a lot of nice stuff in it that's kind of for free, including a photo viewer, a message
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020]   composer.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:20.780]   This is only a program would be interested in this better text fields, URL based navigation.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.540]   This is nice stuff and this guy has done a great job with the Facebook.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.380]   In fact, I like Facebook for the iPhone, but I like to do Facebook interface.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.340]   So do I.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.220]   I've no longer used Facebook on the web.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.620]   I just use it on the iPhone because it's so much.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.420]   It's like the old interface.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.740]   But he really knows what he's doing.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.380]   So he's done a nice job of this.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.900]   This should improve, I think.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.660]   This is the kind of stuff that Apple would have been nice if Apple put in their own SDK.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.540]   But in fact, most program environments have people writing libraries like this.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.780]   It's a sign of maturity in the environment.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.220]   And so I think this is a good thing.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   It's pretty slick.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.220]   Have you seen VIXML also?
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.220]   What's that?
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.300]   It's kind of another interactive environment for the iPhone kind of.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   Is VIXML?
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.740]   I know they were actually before they were supposed to have a contest and I was going
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.340]   to be one of their judges to have developers creating.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   It's kind of like a.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.580]   Oh, you get tapping, shaking, tilting, swiping, pinching.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.580]   It's pretty cool.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.580]   That is really neat.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.500]   Aren't those the lyrics to run DMC's new album?
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.980]   The way the iPhone offers awesomeness.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:36.020]   So this is for, if you can write a webpage, you can write VIXML.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.380]   Yeah, so I feel like it's kind of--
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.100]   Again, it's a framework to make it easier.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:45.260]   Like sort of those, you know, back in the day when GeoCities had your wonderful templates
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:50.020]   for your websites, you just kind of pick your templates and drag and drop things everywhere.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.020]   But it's just kind of like a drag and drop iPhone app.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.060]   I'm trying to figure out is it for apps or is it for the web?
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   It's for apps.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.060]   So it's--
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.900]   So for instance, they have an app called True Flirt that's powered by VIXML.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.700]   One of my favorites they have was for Valentine's Day.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.340]   They had little candy hearts, like in a little box that you could shake.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.580]   Yeah, because it's completely pointless.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   But--
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.580]   Easy to write.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.580]   But people were downloading it.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.580]   Because you can-- yeah, well, that's great.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.380]   I mean, that's the kind of thing you need.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.780]   I think it's more important even than the $50 million venture fund.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.700]   It's making it simple to write applications and simple to submit them.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.220]   And I think Apple's doing a pretty good job.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.540]   They claim at least at the launch of 3.0 last week that they've sped that process up
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.740]   to down to a week now.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.220]   Those are the kinds of things you need to do.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.580]   It's crazy because some of these developers are just like, hey, I'm a 15-year-old kid.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.140]   I just need to say, fun, can you please check it out?
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   Like, sure.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   And this is really, really good.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.140]   Isn't it neat?
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   It's amazing.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.620]   I think that's a-- and that's a very good sign.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.940]   And it's what Apple needs to do to succeed against the palm pre and these other phones
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.140]   is that there's going to be a Windows Mobile Store now.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.780]   There's going to be a store for the Palm pre.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.700]   There's going to be a store for-- I can't remember.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.500]   I guess-- well, there's already a store for the G1 for the Android.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.940]   So I mean, this is what you have to do.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.300]   You have to make it easy to make the apps so that you have more apps in there.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.420]   Help me, I think this is a wrap-up.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.060]   But do you think that the palm pre is going to say palm?
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.620]   I think they'll make them attractive enough that someone will come in and buy them and
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.940]   keep them running for a couple of years.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.100]   I don't think it'll be the big mobile success story.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:34.940]   I mean, I have my own opinions of the palm pre.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.180]   And I think it's OK, interesting idea.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.340]   And in a non-iPhone world, it would be really revolutionary.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.940]   But as is OK, it's a neat idea.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.580]   I'm really surprised when-- again, when I hear opinions from people whom I respect,
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:50.140]   saying that, oh, Apple's in big trouble, this is because it could be real competition,
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.740]   I really have to keep calling people and emailing people and getting more information because
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:01.940]   I just don't see what makes the palm pre on a user level or on a developer level anything
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.620]   more than an interesting OS with a couple of unique features.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.540]   I just don't see this revolution in any package.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.740]   Well, we'll have to see.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.660]   I mean, I'm holding off judgment until I actually have one of my hands.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.940]   The Android and the G1 went wrong is that the G1 hardware is so underpowered that it just
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.140]   feels sluggish compared to the iPhone.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.180]   But the excitement that's behind it and all the developers is--
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.180]   I agree.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.180]   I agree.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.180]   I think it's--
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.260]   If they get some good hardware running Android, I think that's going to be a real challenge.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:40.340]   It really does feel like Linux done right if you follow where the system of the evolution
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.500]   and the acceleration of how cool the features are going to be and how cool the software
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.220]   is going to be is just going to keep accelerating.
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.420]   This year, it's kind of cool.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.420]   It's not something that I would even consider getting instead of an iPhone.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.340]   Next year's apps are going to be even better.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:01.060]   Year after that, I hope that Apple's still working on iPhone 5.0 because I'm really keen
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.300]   to see what the Android OS is going to be like in 2011.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.820]   It's even like the app games are amazing.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.300]   It's like they're porting over-- I've seen a bunch of the games for Wii that they're porting
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.700]   over to the iPhone.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.700]   I was right.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.700]   Like I bought it for Wii and then--
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.700]   Well, like what?
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.700]   What game?
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   The price is right.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   I still playing that hairdresser.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.700]   Oh, the price is right.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   I thought you meant the price was actually right.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.700]   No, the price is right.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.900]   The game, the price is right.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   Wow.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   The actual price is right.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   Wii game is like 50 bucks.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.380]   And then why would I pay that?
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.660]   And then I bought the game for $5.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.660]   Wow.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.660]   Same exact game.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.700]   See, I'm still playing Sally Solons.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.100]   It's the last time you were here.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.100]   I beat it.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.100]   I got to Hollywood and now there's--
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.100]   You done?
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.700]   Like you're like-- you become like a Josey Bear and that's it?
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.700]   It just quits.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.700]   I'm like, come on.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.500]   I just spent like five hours of playing this game and I want to continue on.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.100]   I want more.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.740]   I need-- I just think-- can I just figure out-- there's something you can teach me.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.540]   Where does one get the free time to play a game for five hours?
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.540]   That's one of the time.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.540]   Airplanes.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.100]   Airplanes before I go to bed.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.100]   That's my--
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.820]   And I know that because you Twitter before you go to bed too.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.820]   Because you go to bed.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.820]   I really should go to bed.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.820]   I'm not going to bed any minute now.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.820]   I'm going to go to bed.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:07.820]   And then it's--
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.820]   I'm playing an iPhone game.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.820]   Three in the morning.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.820]   I've got to go to bed.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.820]   I wake up because sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night to see who's Twittering.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.260]   And one of them is frequently justing.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:21.460]   The other cool thing is going back to the example of Sally Salon where she ends at Hollywood.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.460]   Right.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.820]   Now having those in-game kind of paid level.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.820]   Kind of--
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   Yeah, they do-- kind of deal.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.820]   That's going to be--
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.820]   I like that.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.820]   That's going to get people because I'm going to be like--
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.820]   You can subscribe now to a game.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.820]   I just beat this.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.820]   Oh, but you can pay two dollars to keep on playing.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   That's going to hurt the credit card.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.020]   No, I'm with you on that.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.420]   One of the games I recommended-- Pocket God a couple of weeks ago.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.420]   Love it.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   You get new levels every week, right?
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.420]   So there's always more to do.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.420]   It's such a stupid game.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.420]   It's so stupid.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.780]   But there's always something new to do.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.780]   Like electro-cuding the lightning.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   This is a little islander.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.780]   That game is great.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.780]   I'm glad to know.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.780]   So pointless.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.420]   See, we have God complexes.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.020]   We either want to run a salon or we want to zap natives.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.020]   That's it.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.020]   Pretty much.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.420]   Something like that.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   Let's see.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.300]   Any other big stories in the news before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   You got a lot of them, Scott.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.060]   We should mention-- Yeah, go ahead.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.740]   We should quickly mention that China finally gets the iPhone.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.180]   They didn't have it?
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.180]   No.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:30.300]   They had it like a third of all the iPhones sold were in China, but I didn't realize that
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   wasn't legal there.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.340]   So that's one of the new countries, huh?
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.780]   That's one of the new countries.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.780]   Oh.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.220]   Congratulations, China.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.780]   Do you think, Scott, that the next iPhone will have video?
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.620]   I do.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.980]   And I think it's a mistake.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:50.940]   But I think that the extremely loud minority has probably got the ear of the right people
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:56.140]   and that there's the cool factor drives the initial sales of these phones.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.420]   Regular people mostly want them to be a telephone.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.420]   They do a video camera.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.340]   But it's not the cool factor.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.260]   Remember that Apple makes iMovie and Apple has all these cool video distribution systems.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.340]   If you have iPhone as a capture device, as a collection device, it makes iMovie that
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.740]   much more important and that much more imperative.
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.020]   There are very few people who really want to walk around all day with a video camera
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.020]   in their pocket.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.780]   What if you could make a flip mind at all?
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.780]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:24.940]   All this presupposes that you're going to have enough battery life and for any of this
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:25.940]   to matter.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.860]   And I just-- I mean, you start throwing GPS in there.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.900]   You start throwing video cameras in there.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.460]   You know, I mean, at some point in time, the battery's going to say, "Chomp!"
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.660]   OK, but there's this really, really cool and complex technology known as an off switch
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.940]   in the settings panels that simply advises you that, "Hey, you're running."
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.060]   And also, if it would be possible to put a battery indicator of some kind--
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.060]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   They did both of those things.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.580]   I mean, I absolutely see your point.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.940]   But I don't really use certain features.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.700]   I'm glad that I can turn them off and save battery.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:55.780]   I almost never use Wi-Fi.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.700]   I almost never use Bluetooth.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.700]   Those things basically--
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.700]   They will save a lot of battery.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.700]   That'll save a lot.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   Right.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.700]   And they keep that turned off.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.980]   And that's the difference between people who legitimately complain that the iPhone is
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.420]   useless to them because they can only get maybe three, four hours of use because they're
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.420]   talking all the time.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.420]   They're using-- they rely on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.620]   People like me get to-- don't understand that because they get two or three days worth
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:19.620]   of work.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:24.020]   I would, again, I would happily turn on the video camera if, again, I'm just walking along
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.180]   and I see something just awesome, just like a-- just like, you know, that classic scene
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:35.740]   for the movie where you just see this flimsy little plastic bag.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.340]   When the sun is low on the horizon, it's been just sort of tossed around a little bit
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.620]   in an alley.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:44.380]   And I was in New York a couple weeks ago and I was just like that saying, "That's just
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.380]   like that movie.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.380]   Oh, it's so awesome."
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.620]   Oh, I don't have a video camera.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:48.620]   Damn it.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.620]   Oh, man, I'll just sit here and watch.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.620]   Well, that's what--
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.620]   People carry a mineau around.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:56.420]   And I think if you had that kind of quality in your phone, that would be awesome.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.140]   I'd like to see a better camera in general.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   Definitely.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.740]   I mean, I use kind of a beta version of Quick on my iPhone.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.740]   Me too.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.740]   And it's great.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.540]   I mean, the frame rate's like two seconds.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:09.140]   But still, I mean, your battery, it's just like, oh, well, yeah.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:14.540]   I put it in one of those battery add-on cases.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.940]   Oh, carry one of those around all the time because it just doesn't last.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.540]   I use the one that has a light built into it.
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.540]   I can never remember the name of it.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.540]   Fast-track.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   Fast-track, yeah.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   Yes.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.540]   That's the one I have and that's a good one.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.460]   I don't usually need to use it for anything but the light is a key light when I take pictures.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:32.020]   But see, if you had video and the fast-track on there and that light, which stays on,
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.420]   I've got a pretty good solution there.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.420]   It's the power I've ever used.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.940]   My point is, Leo, we're getting these things to the point where people are going to start
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.660]   complaining because there's no microwave built in.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660]   I mean, it's a telephone.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.660]   Oh, Scott.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660]   It's not a telephone.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.300]   It has a bit of telephone in years.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.820]   Have you ever turned on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS?
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.220]   Make sure that the selectivity is set to maximum.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.980]   Then just put it on top of a pop-tart.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.140]   Leave it there for about 20 seconds.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.140]   It's a powerful one.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.500]   It's a microwave after all.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.500]   Palpably warm.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.740]   I'm pretty sure there's a YouTube video where they pop popcorn.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.180]   Yeah, those are fake, but they're fun.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.180]   It's still really funny.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.180]   They're really fun.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.100]   They get four of them aimed at a popcorn.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.100]   And there's actually a whole meme.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.100]   That's a whole meme.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   But it turns out there's a hot...
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.100]   I've heard that Andy Griffith contingent here at...
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.260]   You don't want it.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:19.020]   I don't need it and I want a phone with big numbers and big buttons.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.660]   We just need a telephone so we can call Goober and tell him to bring over a gallon of gas
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.660]   for Aunt B's car.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.460]   I want one that can...
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.100]   You know, you should make that your ringtone, Scott.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.100]   Would somebody send me that please because that would be fun?
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.140]   I thought he might have ringtone.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.700]   He goes, "Oh, I got it.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.100]   Goober, what's that sound coming from?
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.100]   Oh, gosh.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.100]   That's what you need for your ringtone.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.100]   I hear something.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.100]   Where did it...
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.500]   I almost dropped my fly reel.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.140]   It was so annoying.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.140]   So a AT&T has confirmed.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.300]   Let me put another onion on my belt.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.100]   They have the three you're begging me to.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:01.260]   AT&T has confirmed that they're going to get high speed packet access up to 7.2 megabits
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.460]   per second, twice what it is now.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:11.340]   And they even say that sometime this year they're going to start delivering HSPA7, which
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.620]   will be 20 megabits a second.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:20.700]   And the main point of this is that it doesn't require much hardware upgrade, that this
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.580]   actually can run on their existing hardware.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.180]   The software upgraded the electronics to give them that kind of speed.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:31.660]   Now, put a video camera in an iPhone.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:37.380]   Quick, you know, you could be doing what we're doing here in a complicated studio in the
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.380]   field.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.380]   It's crazy.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.380]   And you, I think you just, Dean, would use it right away.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.380]   Oh, just...
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.140]   I could totally see you using that.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.140]   Definitely.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.460]   I mean, you were doing the Justin TV thing.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.500]   This is basically Justin TV in your iPhone.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.420]   And I don't have to put a camera on my head.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   Right.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   That was kind of dorky.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.420]   Oh, what?
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   A dorky.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.020]   Apple's threatening podium or podium.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:06.700]   If you say it, "podium," then you say they're threatening them because it's a pod.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.820]   It's a stand for your iPod.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.020]   I call it a podium.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:14.260]   Yeah, "pode" is in the name, but Apple says you've got to cease and desist using that
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:19.340]   name because we own the pod trademark.
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.740]   This is what happens when you have lawyers on staff, folks.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.740]   Yeah, they're going after invasion of the body snatchers next, for sure.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.740]   The potty snatchers.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:28.740]   Oh, that's right.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.740]   There were pods, right?
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.540]   There were pods.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.220]   Available in a range of fashion colors, no less.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:42.340]   It's actually a very good example of why we simply need some trademark law reform so
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:49.660]   that the need to defend your mark is no longer prevalent in case.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.980]   The case law now says you've got to defend your mark even if it's maybe a violation
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.300]   or else you can lose it.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:00.540]   I think we just need to see that case law stripped out and have the courts come in and
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.580]   say, or at least the legislature come in and say, "We're going to codify this in such
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.220]   a way that says you don't need to defend against every impotable."
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.820]   Well, it's more complicated.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.100]   You have to protect yourself against dilution of the term so that doesn't become like Kleenex.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.220]   That's much more complicated.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.220]   That's my point.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.220]   It's complicated.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.020]   But you don't have to go right and left defending it anytime somebody uses your trademark if
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.820]   it's in a different arena.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.940]   If it's podium, come on.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.140]   Actually, Leo, there would be a lot of lawyers that would disagree with you.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.300]   Guess they're more aggressive.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.620]   Well, I mean, I own several trade marks.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:42.080]   I own several trade marks and we've had to do numerous interventions just because my lawyers
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:47.620]   advise me, "Look, if you don't, then the way it goes, you can lose the trademark and
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.220]   those trademarks cost a lot of money."
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:55.540]   Charlie Miller is a name that sends chills up and down the spines of Mac owners everywhere.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:02.340]   Last year, he found a safari flaw, was able to use it in the annual Pwn to Own contest.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.180]   This is at the Kansas Sec.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.220]   West, Canadian Security Conference in Vancouver every year.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.180]   This year, he did it even faster.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:18.380]   The rule is, "Okay, you get an up-to-date MacBook with all the patches installed.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.380]   You can tell us a link to click on.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:26.660]   And if you manage to take over that computer, you win it and $10,000."
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:32.260]   He did it in ... They clicked the link in him within seconds.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:38.220]   He'd controlled the MacBook Air and won it with a security flaw and safari that he won't
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.220]   reveal.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.780]   He says, "This is worth money.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.900]   I'm not telling you what they say, but that's for security flaws."
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.380]   And to be a hot ... It's not like he's going to be selling it.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.460]   It's selling it to some sort of Russian syndicate.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.820]   Very correctly, if he's worked hard enough to find a security flaw, this glaring, if
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.780]   he wants to apple to hire them, hire him as a consultant to walk him through it, then
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.860]   that's certainly his prerogative.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:02.460]   I hope he's one of those good guys, though, as opposed to just one of those bond villain
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.460]   type of people.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:08.580]   You don't think he has some sort of obligation, many security researchers do feel that they
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.380]   have an obligation to reveal it.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.980]   Not to the public, but to the company first.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:18.660]   I think that you do have a moral obligation, I think, to when you find a weakness, if you
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:24.660]   truly are a white hat instead of a black hat, you basically have an obligation to get this
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.820]   fix as soon as possible.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:29.380]   If the company is responsible for fixing it is ignoring you and leaves it on page ...
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.380]   That's right.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.020]   Then you have a right to escalate.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.060]   There's some period of time, I don't know what it is, three months, six months, where
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.660]   you presume it, "Hey, if I could find it, other bad guys are going to find it.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.660]   They need to fix it.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.660]   They have to fix it.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.660]   We better reveal it."
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.660]   It's interesting.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:47.580]   There are all kinds of these little hat competitions, again, very legitimate competitions
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   to design the locate and fix security holes and all kinds of browsers and all kinds of
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.820]   operating systems.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:54:00.300]   Unfortunately, whereas if you discovered a flaw in, say, October, you'd be like, "Wow,
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.500]   I should actually really get the word out on this and make sure it gets patched."
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.860]   The way that since there's so many of these competitions out there, wait a minute.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:14.460]   If I keep this in my pocket until February, I can definitely crack the system in 10 seconds,
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.460]   get the $10,000 prize, get the air, and then have them patch this thing.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:22.980]   You just got to hope that these people are the first people to figure this out, to figure
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.980]   out this weakness.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:28.980]   Do you want to know another adjective for these types of security consultants?
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:29.980]   Yes.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.980]   FBI suspected.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:33.580]   Well, that's true.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:38.140]   You can't now release it to the Russian mafia.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.140]   Dino...
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.140]   Syrian mafia, they're good, though.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   They're good.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.140]   They're okay.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.140]   They can keep it.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.220]   Dino Dizovi, who is another security consultant, he presented at the source conference in Boston,
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.220]   says, "Yeah.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.580]   Mac OS X is a lot of fun to exploit."
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.420]   He says, "Heap memory is badly guarded.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.300]   It's easy to discover where critical libraries are."
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.820]   He says, "There are flaws in various programs and system components allowing heap memory
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.060]   to be altered."
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:03.980]   He says, "Writing exploits for Vista is hard work.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.940]   Writing exploits for the Mac is a lot of fun."
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.180]   He used to work for Microsoft as my guest.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:15.300]   Then he ended the commercial saying, "And I'm a PC."
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.740]   I'm Dizovi, and I'm a PC.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.700]   You don't see that in the Apple commercials, do you?
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:23.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.700]   I don't want to be with it.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.700]   I'm still waiting to hear, though, about the massive viruses and progenities.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.020]   No, you're right.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:34.420]   The question is, because it's a smaller group of people...
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:39.820]   Well, if we listen to Steve Bomber, apparently it's not so small anymore, so where's the
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.820]   beef?
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.620]   Well, Scott, who's to say that someone hasn't already gotten access to your system?
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.460]   Well, I just know that...
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.460]   Here's what I know that isn't happening.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.580]   Everybody dresses up in a big supervillain uniform and takes over the big screen in Times
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:56:00.580]   Credit, and I'm like, "Ha ha!
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.580]   I now have all of Scott Born's critical information.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.580]   You have six hours to figure out what I'm going to do and stop me from doing it."
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:13.580]   That's actually what's really scary in the PC world is that there are, in fact, estimates
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:18.580]   vary, but tens of millions of computers that are owned by bad guys, but the owners do not
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.580]   know that.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.580]   When I'm really talking about the land, he's the stuff where the Trojan horses, the things
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.500]   that I don't know, Scott, that's old school thinking.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.500]   You do not know.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.300]   Now, I'm not saying that's happening on the back.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.300]   I think there's been any credible evidence to this.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.300]   I understand.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.300]   That's what you're saying.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.780]   We don't have a problem where you can't really trust websites because you think that there's
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:39.460]   going to be random people with random exploits and trying to load up your system with rotations.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.940]   But the problem is it does mean that, Scott, you're a very successful influential person,
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.220]   stuff on your hard drive probably has value.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:52.540]   There are times when I'm not exactly high-profile, but there might be people who, if they're
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:59.100]   if they want to own the machines, let's say 1000 people that might have interesting information
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:02.460]   on their hard drives, my name might come up around 900, 950.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.460]   I don't know.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.980]   So all it takes is for one person, one person who read a press release with a URL embedded
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.100]   in it saying, "Oh, here's a, we're going to be selling the MacBook Air that's completely
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.660]   compatible and Apple can't sue us.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:18.060]   It's only going to cost 99 bucks or is a link here for information."
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.580]   And that would be a bad day for me if I found out two years later.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.580]   Two years later, it finally breaks that there's been this trouble.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.540]   Well, if they break into my hard disk, all they're going to find is information I've
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.780]   been providing to the IRS for my stupid audit.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.420]   Is that still going on?
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.300]   Oh, it's just, it's miserable.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.460]   It's going to never stop.
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:37.980]   They keep saying, "Well, what about this?"
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.820]   And then they call in another year's worth of stuff.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.660]   And then my favorite thing that happened, I won't go into this because I'll get in trouble,
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.500]   but they said, "We're going to rule against all your expenses for 2007."
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:51.660]   I said, "But you only asked for 2006 documents and the guy smiled and said, "Yeah, I know."
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.620]   What are they got against you?
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.580]   Are you a known terrorist or something?
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   No, no.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.820]   It's just sort of like, people don't sue people that are broke and the IRS does not
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.380]   have people that are broke either.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.380]   Good.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.380]   I'm safe then.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.380]   Quit it.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.380]   Whew.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.780]   Man, dodge that bullet.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.460]   We'll be working it out.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:15.300]   I have lawyers in account.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.740]   Yeah, that's what they would find on MyHardDrive today.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.740]   But I understand your point and I am.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.980]   Especially when you say something like Charlie Miller saying, "Hey, look, I can exploit this.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.860]   I can do this."
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:32.900]   I do think that some of this, I've seen some of this hype float around now for a couple
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.340]   of years.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:42.500]   What my point was, I don't see evidence of massive takeovers of Max and such.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.620]   And maybe it's happening.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.980]   Maybe there is no evidence.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:52.020]   But when I don't see the evidence, I still find it hard to be alarmed.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:56.100]   There's no known big, huge thing going on.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:01.420]   I've learned from people like Andy how to protect my networks and such.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:04.820]   We go to basic levels of protection.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:09.940]   Everything's encrypted and we don't do bad Wi-Fi habits like logging on to free public
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.940]   networks, etc.
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:14.060]   We've established a VPN here.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:20.020]   But after you've taken a certain amount of reasonable precautions, I think you can move
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.020]   on.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:26.020]   Well, I think if there were, if this were happening in a massive scale, we'd know about
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.180]   it because people would find it eventually.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:32.020]   Also, there are enough true white hats out there, especially in the Mac community, that
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:36.460]   if anything ever got out in the field, I think that the word would get out really, really
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.100]   quickly and a huge community would arise to smash it down pretty hard.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:44.780]   But it does bear remembering that it's not that the Macintosh operating system has been
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:49.260]   touched by the hand of God to be the most secure and infallible system out there.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.040]   That a lot of the reasons why we don't have to deal with a lot of the mess that the window
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.380]   side has to deal with is that we are 8 to 9 percent.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.700]   We are a fraction of mere sliver of the pie.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.260]   We're not an attractive and cost-effective target.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.260]   That's right.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.860]   And I do dread that day that I have to provide us protection on my computer.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.940]   I know.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.660]   So we should just enjoy it now while we can.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.580]   That always wrinkles me when I'm setting up Windows machines.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.420]   It really is like a protection.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   I know the Symantec and Norton and all these other companies that are legitimate companies,
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.620]   but you always feel like, "Nice computer you've got here.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:26.260]   Be ashamed if there ain't been any viruses where they come in there, but in a key logger."
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.340]   But tell you what, won't I leave one of my boys here?
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.020]   It only cost you a hundred bucks a year.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.180]   We'll keep those things.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:39.780]   It is the feared Irish English-Australian buff guy.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.380]   They're terrifying, aren't they?
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.380]   They're the worst.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.380]   My apologies to...
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.380]   They're the worst.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.700]   I hate those guys.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.700]   I hate them.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.860]   You know what I mean?
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:54.740]   It's like, "I'm giving you $70 a year for virus definitions for a problem that really
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.580]   should not be happening to begin with."
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.780]   Okay, that's fine.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780]   Good.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780]   Glad we understand each other.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.100]   You can now buy and rent films and hide deaf on iTunes.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.100]   I thought we could do that before.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.100]   That's a two.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.100]   I did two.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.100]   Me too.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.100]   So why is this?
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:16.100]   March 19th, 2009, according to CNET, customers can buy hit titles for $19.99 in high-def.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.100]   Yick.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.100]   Reynolds before '99.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.100]   Maybe CNET is something.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.900]   I know it's like an old...
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.700]   Alex Lindsey put this in here.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.900]   I know I've been downloading, of course.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.940]   It's not the best show ever, but Gossip Girl.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.500]   If anybody watches it, I'm a big fan, so I've been downloading that on iTunes.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.220]   When I download the HD, it also gives you the standard definition?
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.540]   Yeah, I've been getting the Office in HD and I get the standard definition as well.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.500]   It's so annoying, though, because then it takes you to the camera.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500]   Double download, I know.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.020]   So I just actually canceled the HD, download the SD, and that's a perfect line.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.580]   It says here that...
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.460]   I did double check, and there is a press release on the Apple PR wire from just about three
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.460]   days ago.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.700]   I announced this from Apple.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.300]   It sounds from the press release.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.140]   Now we're asked, catalog titles were available in HD.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.300]   Now they've gotten the latest hits.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.940]   Box offers favorites, including Quantum of Solace and Twilight, and studying HD of the
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.020]   iTunes, starting today.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:15.580]   They also want you to pre-order Quantum of Solace, apparently.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.940]   By the way, the reason they send you the SD version is because your iPhone can have
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.420]   your iPod touch and stuff like that.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.300]   Just stick with the SD, as you say.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.140]   I'm not buying HD anymore, because it's fine.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.140]   It doesn't even matter.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.300]   I don't even want to watch the show once.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.300]   It'll be done with it.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.300]   Who doesn't have the best?
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.300]   Who doesn't have the best?
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.300]   If it's Quantum of Solace, maybe...
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.300]   I'm going to get the Blu-ray.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.300]   Let's face it.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.300]   I'm not going to...
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   Download it.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.060]   Anyway, let's take a break.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.060]   Come back.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.180]   We're going to get your picks of the week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.180]   So prepare them.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.180]   Think about them.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.300]   Congetate while I tell you about my pick.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.740]   Or maybe Andy has a pick for Audible.com.
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.540]   Do you have an Audible pick for us, Andrew?
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.580]   I always have an Audible pick if you want to go all over the world.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.580]   You are so good.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.140]   No, no, no.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.540]   Because I do picks on all the other shows, so I'll let you do the Audible picking on this
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.540]   show.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.700]   Let me just first tell people what Audible is, in case they don't know.
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.940]   How could that be?
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.460]   If this is your first time listening to one of our shows, you may not have heard of Audible.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.460]   It is a...
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:16.460]   Basically, think of it as an online bookstore filled to the brim with great audiobooks,
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.940]   performances.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.540]   Most of them unembridged of the great works of all.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:27.100]   I mean, bestsellers, brand new stuff, thrillers, science fiction, classics, nonfiction to, history,
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.260]   science, business, self-help.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:35.540]   It's all there at audibleaudible.com.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:40.580]   And if you want to sign up now for an Audible Gold account, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.260]   You try it free for 30 days.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.820]   Your first book, you get the credit toward the book, yours to keep even if you decide
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.820]   not to stick around.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.380]   So it's kind of like getting a free book.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.540]   That's why we like to give you a recommendation.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:54.860]   And that's exactly what Mr. Andy and all co is going to do right now.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:59.100]   I promise all our overseas listeners I will not do anything approximating an English
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:03:59.940]   or Australian.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.940]   That's...
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.420]   That's one of the...
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.180]   There are two things Americans do that people...
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.780]   Oh, I hate it.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.340]   One is like start wars in other places.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.660]   The other is do try to do the Jackson Club.
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.100]   I can't tell which is worse actually.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.260]   Well, I definitely the worst...
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.260]   Well, anyway.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:24.260]   I don't like inspirational books every time.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:29.940]   I feel as though one second of at least one full day of possibility of joy in my life
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.060]   has sucked out of my body every time I see a new volume of chicken soup for the wallpaper
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.860]   or soul or whatever.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.820]   Because every time I see one of these inspirational books, I just imagine some guy like in a filthy
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:44.420]   t-shirt with pizza sauce running it on the front, smoking a big cigar, hasn't shaved
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   it for four days.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:52.460]   So look at every sunshine is like God's rainbow kissing you with joy.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.460]   There you go.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.460]   Okay.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.460]   You should feel better now.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.460]   All right.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.460]   Good day's work.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460]   Good to work.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.460]   That's with $40.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:07.020]   But there's a definite example I make for a really great series on NPR called This I Believe.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.420]   There was a radio series starting in the '50s where they would approach luminaries famous
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:17.020]   people and just ask, is there anything that you particularly believe that you think has
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.580]   influenced your life greatly?
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.580]   And the only rule is that you only have about 500 words to say this essay.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.860]   You can't be negative.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.580]   So you can't say, I believe that all Democrats are wrong.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.380]   I believe that all Republicans are idiots because I as head of the Democratic Party,
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.380]   you know, you have to be positive.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.580]   It has to be about you.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.780]   You can't use it to do anything else.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.140]   And you would think that this would be a series of essays all about, I believe that the
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:46.380]   stars of God's fairy chain and every time a wee fairy knows it knows a baby is born.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.220]   You know, most of these essays are just really well.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.220]   Here's what I've been through in life.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.620]   And here's something that I experienced.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:58.300]   And here's things that give me pause to lean back for a second and just think for a moment.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:04.180]   One of my favorite ones was from Penn Gillette, who was approached to do one of these, this
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.700]   I believe essays.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:11.820]   And he decided to do, I believe, he wanted to do, I believe there is no God, but that violated
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.540]   the, no, you can't say you're against something.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.660]   You have to say what you do believe, right?
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:21.180]   So he did one of the most brilliant and thoughtful essays on what being an atheist means to him.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.740]   And you know, if people, I think that it was, it was exactly the sort of thing that it really
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.620]   proves the, the primacy of this sort of concept.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:33.400]   Whether you agree with this belief, whether you disagree with this belief, you will definitely
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.260]   be illuminated because you're talking, you're hearing a personal story about how someone
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.760]   thinks.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.600]   And some of them do tend to be more up there in the clouds.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.980]   But they have, they've produced two different books of collections of these, these audio
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.400]   essays, some of them going all the way back to the 50s, some of reason as just a couple
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.560]   of years ago, some of these are done by very famous people.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   They got Eli Wiese-Viesel.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.960]   They've got some by Stud's Turkle.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:01.360]   They got some by, you know, Eleanor Roosevelt, John Updike, all those guys.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.840]   But some of the most interesting ones are people from just average people that you've
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.160]   just never heard of because they have, they have their own website and they just simply,
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   when they revived the series a few years ago, they just said, look, here's a URL.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   Please submit an essay.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.640]   If we like it, we'll have you come in and record it for us.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.280]   And it's one of my, they do podcasts and unfortunately they're ending it.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.560]   They're bringing it to a close sometime in the next month or so.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.080]   And so the easiest way to get it will be through these audio book collections.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:32.760]   But whenever it comes up on my playlist of freshest podcasts, oftentimes that's the
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.200]   moment where I have to reach over and press the pause button on the iPhone on my dash
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:40.640]   and just think about what I've just thought, I've just heard and how it's relevant and
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   how I react to it.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.520]   It really is just marvelous, marvelous stuff.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.040]   I hope I didn't insult people by saying, you know, if you don't like to think about
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.240]   nice things, this probably isn't for you.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   That's not what I meant.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.720]   But like I said, if you, you know, you probably never, if you're a right thinking person,
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.840]   you've probably never even considered buying a chicken soup for the blah, blah, blah soul.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.060]   This isn't for those people.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:03.480]   This is for folks like us who just have have an ability to think about the higher thing
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.480]   sometimes.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.520]   I'm not going to say anything, but my son loves chicken soup for the teenage soul.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   But okay.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.520]   Sorry.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.520]   Okay.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.120]   Someone gave me a copy of again, something like, you know, it's a chicken soup for the
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.720]   guy who's upgrading from SCSI to firewire souls.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.720]   That maybe is going a little far.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.560]   That might be going really far.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.560]   You know what?
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:28.480]   I don't, I really don't think that when I look at a firewire 800 cable, I'm going to see every
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.120]   link of copper as a different shining moment that I'm making from leap to leap, both across
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.240]   the stream of life.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.760]   I think I just going to plug it in and see if the light comes on.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.840]   You know, I mean, this is absolutely nothing like that.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.440]   I almost never come across one of these essays where I'm thinking, Oh God, what kind of
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   cheese is this guy selling?
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.680]   You're a cynic face it.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.680]   Let's face it.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   You're a cynical man.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.360]   I'm an optimist and I'm a great student of human nature.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.200]   Like I said, my admission here is going to last at least another 200 years and my final
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:01.840]   report will be most favorable to your continuing to exist as a colony.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   Thank you.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.520]   I'm pulling, I'm pulling for you guys and books like this, I believe really make me think
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.120]   you guys are going to pull it through in the long run.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.160]   This I believe and the Enocho.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.860]   Thank you for your recommendation.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.640]   This I believe part one and part two unabridged by Jay Allison.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.520]   He's the NPR producer who does the shows really one of the great producers in radio.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.560]   He's just and even if they didn't use my essay, I still recommend them.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.920]   Did you send him one?
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.000]   I said them an essay, right?
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.600]   But you know, I'm sure they get they get tens of thousands, but I was clearly.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:38.080]   Andy, if I would like to read your essay at the end of this show, we would be very honored.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080]   It's on a hard drive somewhere.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.280]   I should record it just to.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280]   Would you please?
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.640]   I would put it at the end of the show.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   Every time.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.840]   What the hell does it not go?
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.880]   Believe that's what I want to know.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.840]   I believe that the man of the video counter in Ellsworth, Maine did not give me change
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.760]   from my $20 bill.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.040]   I believe that I didn't give him a five as he insisted to his manager.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:05.120]   And I believe they're wrong to throw me out of the store without giving me my proper change.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   It's inspirational.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.040]   It makes you think I don't know why that it is.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.240]   Focusing on the important issues in today.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:16.440]   This I believe, article.com/macbreak, you can get this free as your first book to give
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.440]   it a try.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   We love Audible.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   We know you will too.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   We thank them so much.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440]   That went on.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440]   So I forgot we were in the middle of an ad.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.040]   Well, no, that's the the ad.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040]   The ad think of the ads.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.240]   If people sometimes say that, they say, well, the audible ad is so long, but really the
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.800]   ad is actually short.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.680]   It's 30 seconds at the beginning and the end of a pick.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   I'm just kidding.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   I'm just kidding.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.520]   The kick is the is really content.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.680]   So don't think of it as an ad.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.040]   Think of it as a moment that we pause to hear about a great book brought to you.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.760]   And it sounds like a great book, but it gave me an idea for another book that should be
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.400]   done, which is I believe book titles that will never be printed.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.640]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.080]   Such as chicken soup for the soul and a guide to local strip clubs.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.680]   Yeah, I don't know about that one.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.640]   You'd be so proud of my 14-year-old.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   I believe.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.960]   First visit to Hooters.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.400]   His first visit to Hooters.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   I saw that.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   I saw your two.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.440]   What kind of great dad does this guy take him to?
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.440]   I didn't bring him.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.080]   It was they were at the lacrosse game.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.360]   One of the the game was in San Francisco.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.480]   One of the dads who drives a limo picks picks like the six kids up going to the lacrosse
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480]   game in a stretch.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.040]   They drive to San Francisco.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.320]   The dad now this is the undefeated team they're playing.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.520]   They're nine and oh dad says if you win thinking this will never happen.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.720]   If you win, I'm taking you all to Hooters for wings.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720]   They won.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720]   Oh my gosh.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.200]   They beat this undefeated team.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:39.400]   So there was a certain amount of urgency to their play.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.400]   I think he did.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   I think he actually probably did inspire them.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.800]   That was so funny.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.160]   And Henry says, hey dad, the waitress sat next to me to take my order.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.560]   I said, I'm sure that was a great thrill for you.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.520]   He said, I couldn't see anything.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.000]   The sun was shining in my eyes.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   The sun or headlights.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   I don't know.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   Oh dear.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.400]   I'm so embarrassed.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   So let's get to our picks of the week.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.240]   Ladies first, Justine, what would you like to pick for us today?
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.720]   I've got two little treats for you.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.720]   Teleport.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720]   Teleport.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.720]   Can you use this before?
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.880]   It's an extension that you install and it will allow you to take control of all of
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.640]   your Macs on the network.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.800]   I've heard of it, but I have not used it.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.200]   You can drag and drop files between the computers and in the actual preferences, you
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.480]   can just line up your computers and you can just go from screen to screen by going to
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.080]   the edge of your computer and it'll just hop.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   Computer to computer.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.120]   I have like three computers and I actually did recently purchase a television to watch
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.880]   Hulu and my iTunes content on.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   I don't have cable.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.680]   I'm glad you got priorities.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.960]   But I have a TV to watch Hulu on.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.280]   So I have one of my old MacBook Pro up to that.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280]   Driving it?
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.600]   So I just sit, actually this is what I use my MacBook Air for as a remote control or
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   my other MacBook.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   Could use for that.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.480]   So I just go over and I use it as a remote.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.480]   And it's amazing.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.640]   So I have like three computers hooked up, controlling from one.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.680]   And also there's an iPhone app that you can use to VNC and control directly from your
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.120]   iPhone, your computers.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.120]   So it's called Jadoo, J-A-A-D.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.960]   Now this is a different program.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.680]   So there's Teleport and there's Jadoo.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.240]   Teleport is for your Mac and Jadoo is for your iPhone.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:25.120]   So both are pretty amazing for when you're trying to watch TV from your computer.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.320]   She's the queen of remote control.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.320]   It's great.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.560]   If you use them together, does that mean you can teleport to the planet of Jadoo?
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.840]   It's done.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.880]   I use a program that's a Windows Mac Linux program called CinerGee.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.480]   We're using it here on the Skype of Saurus so that I can have one keyboard and mouse
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.480]   control all four of those.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   It's very similar to Teleport.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   It's exactly what that is.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.480]   But people have told me Teleport is really, really cool.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   So I have to give it a try.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480]   Oh, I love it.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.480]   And it can even use the copy and paste from the computer.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.480]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.040]   So it's really nice.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.280]   One thing that this CinerGee does that, but it doesn't do the drag and drop.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   So that's really cool.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.960]   You could take a file from one desktop and drag it over to the other Mac.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   It's great.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   Wow.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   It's amazing.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   That is a nice feature.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   I really like that.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.600]   Jadoo J, is it J-A-A-D-U?
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   J-A-A-D-U.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.720]   Double A-D-U.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:17.160]   And Teleport, two picks from Justine at iJustine.com.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.400]   And now Mr. Scott Bourne.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.640]   You know, we don't have Alex here to do a really expensive product, Scott.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.400]   Maybe you'd like to take his role today.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.240]   Well, I'm not going to get near an Alex, but I'm going to get down around the world.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.600]   Just under half an Alex.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:34.680]   But first I have to say, thanks to Twitter, I figured out what we missed on the HD story.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.480]   It is that they are available for sale.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   Jeff Roy sent me a Twitter saying it's not before.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.400]   They were available for rent.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.080]   But thank you, Jeff.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.320]   My pick of the week is something that photographers will enjoy.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.800]   I know this will come as a shock to you, Leo.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.760]   But you don't have to be a high-end photographer to like this.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.280]   Millions of people sell things on eBay and post pictures on Flickr of little doodads that
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.920]   are important to their lives.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:05.720]   And a company called ProScik, which makes real psychoramas for the movie business, has
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:12.000]   got a product out called My Studio 20, which is a tabletop set up 20 inches long that gives
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.880]   you a real psych wall, one piece psych wall, and a studio light with reflectors for $250.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.120]   And I swear, it gives you like a little miniature photography studio.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.360]   If you want to take pictures of watches or rings or glasses or bottles or things that
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.280]   you might sell collectibles, for instance, on eBay, you'd have to have one of these things
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.440]   to get really good shots.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.800]   And it inspires me to think of all kinds of cool little miniature things I might start
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   doing.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.000]   We're going to play around with it using the lens baby.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.280]   We're going to shoot some miniature stuff and see what we can't create.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.560]   But I was really impressed.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560]   I just got it yesterday.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.960]   I saw it at PMA and they sent me one.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.400]   I put it together last night.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.240]   I will say there's a little bit of assembly involved and I'm not good with assembly.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.800]   So if you're not either, you've got to keep that in mind.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.560]   There are screwdrivers and such that have to be applied to this device.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.920]   But once you get it installed, it's pretty slick.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.960]   And the one thing that these guys do that I haven't seen in some of the cheaper and similar
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.200]   products is they come up with some fill cards that really balance the light around and it
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.080]   helps you to get a nice exposure without what we call specular highlights, which are blown
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.480]   out and completely devoid of any kind of data.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.680]   You don't want that in the tower.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:29.240]   If you don't want anything going past 255 on the histogram because that just means nothing's
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.240]   there.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.800]   So to avoid specularity, they use a lot of fill and it's really quite ingenious.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.120]   So you can find their website.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.080]   I think it's proc yc.com and they make larger versions of this as well.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.080]   So that's my pick.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080]   Very good.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.520]   Did I cause your eyes to glaze over?
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   Yes.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.360]   Tell me again the URL.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.360]   It's proc yc.com.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.080]   As long as I got your eyes to glaze over, Leo, I know I did my job.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.480]   How do you pronounce PROC yc?
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.480]   Pro psych.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.040]   Psych is a psych wall is like a psych.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   Oh, I get it.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.040]   I get it.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   I get it.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   I get it.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040]   You're just a little slow on the uptake today.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   I'm a little slow.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   That's all.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.480]   We're going to get to Andy's pick in just a second and my pick two before we do.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.280]   I do want to mention actually I want to tell you about this, Justine because you're a big
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.280]   time blogger.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.680]   Do you know that square space?
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680]   I don't.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.200]   Oh, I'm loving square space.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.080]   Square space is a blog engine you may not have heard of.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.400]   Everybody knows about type pad and WordPress.com and so forth.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.840]   It's similar to those two in the sense that it's a hosted blog engine.
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.960]   But after that, just leave it all behind.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.480]   I mean, this thing is unbelievable.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.280]   It is.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.280]   First of all, you can drag.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.640]   They have a bunch of beautiful templates.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   Okay.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   But you can then drag using Ajax stuff around on the template.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   You can add widgets.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.680]   It's all very click-clickable.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.880]   It will import your blog from any other blog host.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   So you can try it.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880]   It's a free two week trial.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.760]   You can try it from type pad, from blogger, from WordPress.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.260]   Some other stuff.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:07.260]   Just import it directly in.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.720]   You can see what it looks like.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.160]   Then if you decide not to go with it, you can export it back out.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.600]   And you don't have to give them a credit card, Leo.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.600]   That's one thing I like about it.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.600]   No credit card needed.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.560]   Just go to a quick trial.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.000]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.920]   If you do decide to become a Squarespace customer, use squarespace.com/macbreak to get 10% off.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.760]   Also, I've been blown away by this.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.040]   Kevin Rose is using it now.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.680]   Sarah Lane is using it now.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.320]   We're moving our blogs over to it.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.720]   And I don't want to even say blog because it's really a web publishing engine.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.040]   They have an incredible gallery, photogramme, gallery features.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.960]   They have forums.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.400]   The widgets give you the ability to be like a programmer.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   You don't have to know how to write the code to create a guest book.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.040]   You just drag the guest, and you got one.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   Exactly.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.520]   But if you have things like if you use discuss, for instance, which I do, I say, "Well, I
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.760]   want to use discuss instead of your comment engine."
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.760]   They said, "No problem.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.920]   That's one line of JavaScript."
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:03.920]   It's very simple.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.360]   We'll just add it for you.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.440]   It is really...
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.440]   I'm very impressed by these guys.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.240]   They've done a great job.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.240]   Try it for free.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.720]   No credit card required.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.720]   Take the tour.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:23.360]   They've just got great stats, amazing templates.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.080]   But it goes on and on.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.400]   Mark Eko is using it for their business site.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.960]   It's very impressive.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.160]   It's hosted on their servers?
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.920]   It's hosted, which means you don't install it on your server.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.200]   But there's a real advantage to having it hosted on their servers.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.840]   They use a very sophisticated...
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.600]   I was talking to them about this virtual server technology that allows them to add capacity
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.760]   and benefit everybody instantly.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:52.160]   So you never have to worry about being dug or slash-stotted because you'll never run a
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.440]   bandwidth on this thing.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.080]   It's really impressive what they've done.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.440]   And you can still use your own URL, too.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.840]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.880]   You've got to do that.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.880]   You can see...
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.680]   We're working on my blog, leoville.squarespace.com.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.960]   We're just getting the templates down and then we're going to import some of the data in.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.920]   But it's really, really...
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.080]   I'm really having a blast playing with it.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:21.920]   Anthony Castellena, who's the guy who created this young guy, just as usual, it's usually
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.120]   the case, wrote it for himself.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.880]   Got some good ideas, got bigger and bigger.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.000]   And now it's just a platform that I wish more people knew about.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.840]   We're doing our best to spread the word.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840]   Squarespace.com/MacBreak.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:35.480]   Give it a try.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.000]   It's free for two weeks.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.720]   No credit card necessary.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.640]   And then use MacBreak as the promo code.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.160]   If you want to sign up, you'll get 10% off.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.520]   Offer code, MACBREAK.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.640]   And I just love the fact that you can get that data in and out.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.560]   Search engine optimization, all sorts of stuff.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.320]   This is really exciting.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.320]   Are you WordPress?
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.320]   I'm all WordPress, yeah.
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.600]   So here what you can do is you can try it for two weeks.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.680]   Just import the data and just see what it would look like and play with it a little bit.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   Anyway.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.920]   Not going to force you to.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.920]   You got all your systems set up, but we're moving.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.600]   Do it now, just do it.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.840]   No, we're moving all our stuff over.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   It's very exciting.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.120]   Start smoking too.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.840]   My pick, speaking of blogs.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.880]   And by the way, it's supported by Squarespace.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:27.760]   Now, remember I mentioned Blogo, the blogging engine or desktop client, I guess is the best
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.920]   way to describe it.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:32.880]   But I have some good news from my friend Daniel Jalkut, who doesn't, he does Mars edit and
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.880]   I go back and forth between Mars edit and Blogo.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.640]   I can't decide which I like better.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:41.640]   But now I'm liking Mars edit because they just added the ability to support Tumblr.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.360]   And I use Tumblr a lot.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:51.880]   So now when I use Mars edit to edit my blogs, I can go to my Tumblr blog and post their
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.200]   edit there.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.400]   This is something that's actually kind of hard to do on Tumblr.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.000]   Editing your existing posts is not terribly easy.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.320]   You have full control in just as if we're any other blog.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.760]   And I'm using Tumblr for the quick and dirty little pictures, not dirty, they're not dirty
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   pictures.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.480]   But I mean, the quick posting of pictures, quotes, stuff that I, you know, not full blog
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.280]   posts, I love Tumblr for that.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.320]   And this makes it absolutely super easy.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.560]   I've been a fan of Mars edit for a long time.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.880]   And if you are a Mars edit user, absolutely you want to get the upgrade.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.800]   It just came out today to support Tumblr.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.400]   And if you're not, you might want to give it a try.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.880]   It's from Red Sweater Software.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.080]   I think there's a dash in there.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.960]   Let me just do a quick Google on it.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.000]   Yeah, red-sweater.com/MarsEdit.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.560]   Free 30-day trial, $29.95 if you decide to buy it or upgrade from the 1.0 version for
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.560]   $10.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.560]   Very good stuff.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.040]   Daniel's very responsive too.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.720]   And that's what's neat.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.000]   Works with WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Typepad, Moveable type, LiveJournal, Drupal and Vox,
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.920]   just to name a few.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.920]   And Squarespace, let me add that name.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.080]   I'm signing up right now actually.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080]   Are you?
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   You're going to give it a try?
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   I totally am.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.080]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.080]   Well, let me know what you think of it.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]   I will.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.080]   Yeah, we have friends there.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   We can hook you up.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.080]   Very cool.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   I'm sure they'd love to have you on their platform.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]   It looks awesome.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.080]   They would love to.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.320]   And the thing is, I'm tired of running my own server.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.440]   We have to run our own servers for this and the other stuff.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.360]   But for my own blog, it's like...
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.160]   It's a process, then stuff goes down.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   Stuff goes down.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.520]   You have to worry about backups.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:35.160]   I lost a bunch of pictures and a hard drive failure a couple of months ago and I was still
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.160]   killing me.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.960]   So, I like the idea of having it hosted.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.560]   As long as you can get it in and out.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.560]   And that's the key.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.560]   I think it's really important.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560]   I was using Vox for all.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.560]   I couldn't get it out of Vox.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.520]   I had to go through, jump through hoops to do it.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.880]   Finally my friends, Mr. Andy Ennukto with his pick of the week.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   Andrew.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.880]   Hello.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:24:02.080]   All of us suffered a great tragedy late last year when an awesome and just absolutely standard
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.120]   video tool for the Macintosh called iSquint just up and disappear.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.760]   The developer was a great free tool.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.160]   It was exactly what you needed to take.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.560]   Videos you downloaded off the net or stuff that you ripped off a DVD and just quickly
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.400]   and easily convert them to whatever format you suddenly needed.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.040]   Like if you needed a copy for your iPod or if you needed a copy for your third party
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:27.360]   phone or just needed a really quick simple version that you could throw up into a web
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.560]   link, that was the tool you used.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.000]   There are other stuff like QuickTime Pro that will let you do it, but that's $30.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.720]   And really you just needed to use this once.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.600]   Why spend $30 just to do this one tool?
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.400]   But again, unfortunately, the developer decided that he wanted to get out of the free software
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.400]   business.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.280]   And not only did he, which is his prerogative, I've always thought that he didn't really
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.640]   get into details about why he pulled it, but I have to assume that it was a decision that
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:54.400]   he made out of a desire to improve his life and we can't begrudge him for that.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.480]   But not only did he stop, he didn't just stop supporting it.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.120]   He just actually pulled all the binaries off the nets who couldn't even download the last
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.120]   edition.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.960]   But he was nice enough to release the source code to sourceforged.net.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.080]   And just last week, I think someone released what I think is going to be the new iSquint.org
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.720]   app called VideoMonkey, which you can download from videomonkey.org.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.200]   Oh, I pray you are right.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   I miss visual.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.120]   Yeah, and it's not a direct clone of iSquint and visual hub.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.560]   It uses a lot of the same code.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.920]   And but the great thing is it's exactly the same sort of philosophy.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.680]   It's a free one window, very simple video converter that you can just drag two dozen
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:38.040]   quick times or two dozen different video files of all kinds of different kinds into the window.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.520]   Click one button, go out for waffles by the time you come back and you know, your parts
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:48.560]   of your macro now puddle of attractive plastic on your on your desktop.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.800]   All the files have been converted and it's been done exactly the way you want.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.360]   It's not one it's not one of these like Adobe master edition sweet power tools.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.360]   It's a one function tool that does exactly what you want it to do.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360]   And it does it for free.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   Awesome.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   Awesome.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.360]   Now I noticed this point one.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.360]   Is it pretty reliable?
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360]   It's pretty reliable.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   I was using it over the weekend to once again do the classic thing where I always because
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:15.120]   I use Apple TV a lot and because I've got like gigabytes and I've got like almost a
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.880]   terabyte of movies on my Drobo on the network.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.480]   I always rip all my DVDs at the absolute highest quality highest bandwidth that I can
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.640]   get them at.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.160]   But when it comes time to mix a version that I can play on my iPhone, I don't want to
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.760]   take up two and a half gigabytes of space.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.880]   So I used to use I squint all the time just to say, well, just rip me a really quick,
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.960]   you know, 420 by three 480 by 320 or something version of it.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.600]   So I converted about like a dozen movies over the weekend.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.920]   And the selling point of this sort of tool has always been you just drag it in, click
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.560]   a button, come back later and it's done.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   And that's exactly what happened.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560]   Worked just fine.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560]   Wow.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.560]   Video monkey.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560]   It's about time.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.160]   I've been waiting for now.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.760]   He's it looks like he used a lot of the visual hub code, which was open sourced.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.760]   Right.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.760]   Yeah, exactly again.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.960]   Before before taking all down, he did release his project files, I think to source forged
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.960]   that.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.480]   Like I said, it's not like it's not like the exact same tool rebranded for as with a clip
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.680]   part of a monkey on a tree.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:19.560]   But the way he could have screwed it up is by not getting the philosophy of the tool.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.760]   And this is exactly he did exactly the right thing with it.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.760]   It's a really nice little tool.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:27.560]   And I hope he keeps developing it without adding without adding a second window, shall
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.000]   we say now tell me download it because I'm downloading it.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.680]   It's a dot package.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.240]   And now I don't know what to do with that.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.240]   It doesn't want to open.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240]   Oh, there it is.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.240]   Oh, it did open.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240]   Okay.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.640]   This is exciting because I still have a copy of visual hub that I use.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.040]   Yeah, I packed it up.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.640]   You know, he gave instructions for packing it up so you can keep it.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.280]   But but it'd be nice to have something to keep.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.360]   Was it wasn't running on FFM peg for some reason?
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360]   I think it was.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.840]   Yeah, it was it was it was a the secret of this software was that there's a whole bunch
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.760]   of libraries that work with the standard Unix and Linux and Darwin video conversion that
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.040]   are command line tools.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.920]   And this was the awesome visual front end to all those to the solid.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.720]   It's not like he brought like millions of dollars worth of code from malius.com to do
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:14.960]   all the stuff.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.240]   But it just gives you a hint as to what are the all the power that's available in the
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.600]   open source libraries.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.000]   You just waiting for somebody to create a version that the humans can actually operate
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   as a product.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.720]   So it does look at at least as simple as visual hub in terms of the drag and drop.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.840]   Can you queue and queue stuff?
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.840]   Yep.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.160]   You can just drag multiple things.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.160]   It's exactly the same way.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.520]   Just drag multiple things into that one window.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520]   Select your settings.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.400]   Now, I think that when I'm looking at things that mark this as a point one version of anything,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:51.320]   I think the fact that the quality settings is one big slider that goes the entire window.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:55.680]   That's exactly the sort of thing you want to refine as you keep, you know, you're you're
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.680]   you're happy.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.680]   You've got the thing working.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.680]   It's successful.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.640]   And now you're really excited to get it to actually release it.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.800]   But then like version two, you think, Oh, wow.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800]   I really should.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.480]   I know I want to go to bed that night, but maybe I should have just waited next day.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.600]   Hey, at least has the menu where you can make it for all Apple devices, iPod, iPhone,
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.720]   iPod, touch your Apple TV.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.400]   And it looks like he's planning to do it for Xbox and PSP and we and all those other.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.400]   That's great.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   No complaints of it.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.000]   But no, again, no complaints of any kind.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.320]   It is exactly right.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.960]   And it's free, free, free, free, free, free, which is a great really is a great gift to
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.600]   all Mac users everywhere because this is needed.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:38.840]   This is this is almost a critical tool as all of us get more dependent on digital forms
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.440]   of our media and all of us keep acquiring new devices for watching our TV shows and watching
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.680]   our movies.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.560]   If you don't have a tool like this, man, you can get by without it, but life is so much
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.160]   better with a tool like this.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.440]   And there's there have been some other attempts at this.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.440]   There's video evangelists.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.940]   Somebody's reminding me, I mean, a dig works is reminding me in the chatroom or digi works.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.940]   But this one's not free.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:29:59.940]   It's $10.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.940]   I'm going to video monkey.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:07.220]   It is for the win as they say.
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.220]   Well, thank you everybody.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:14.940]   We thank you for being here and he not goes at the celestial waste of bandwidth C W O B
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:15.940]   dot com.
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:17.780]   And he's also the Chicago Sun times.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:23.300]   Yes, he's one of those ink stained wretches you hear about the species.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:24.300]   A stained rec.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:27.060]   That's time my buddy should be described.
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.060]   You and I.
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.060]   It was fun.
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:34.220]   Scott Kurtz at PvP had these had these really great t-shirts at Webcomics weekend last week.
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:39.180]   I think you can still order them from PvP online where like in the exact typography of
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:43.060]   like a New York post headline that says I'm killing newspapers.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:46.620]   And it's all print by reading Webcomics.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:47.620]   I like it.
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.620]   I like it.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.420]   I got to make sure I don't wear that like when I meet with my editor.
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:53.180]   Newspaper killer Andy and not go.
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.180]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.540]   Here's a guy who only kills bits.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:03.260]   That's Mr. Scott born at scottborn.com which many many different photography resources
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.260]   there.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.100]   His aperture workshops.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.100]   Chance to win.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:09.300]   Are you giving like a Drobo a day away?
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.580]   I gave away 12 11 Drobo's this month.
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:14.900]   One more to go on March 30th ever mad given away.
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.340]   Let's babies given away Drobo.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:20.340]   What happens is I just realized that we don't have enough space here at the studio.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.500]   So I just give stuff away.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:24.300]   Oh, you mean you're not being given these by Drobo and lens.
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.820]   Maybe I'm just kidding.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:26.820]   I'm kidding.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.020]   Oh, yeah, that's going to say.
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:29.940]   What happens is the UPS guy.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:32.380]   UPS guy drops off for eight or 10.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.540]   Like, OK, now what I'm going to do.
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.540]   I got to get rid of him.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.540]   I get him.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:39.700]   I keep telling Scott that someday like Drobo is going to thank him for buying so many
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.860]   Drobo's by making a special one of a kind one that's like the shape of a hexagon with
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:48.260]   like a little dome top so that if as they are guessing he really does want to build an
[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.220]   igloo out of Drobo's.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:55.780]   He'll have that keystone he can drop on the top as the final piece of it.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:00.420]   If that's the plan, that's by the way something something really kind of cool and exciting.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:03.020]   We're just experimenting with this is an idea.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:07.420]   This is sort of like a beta hush hush idea, but we'll tell a few hundred thousand of our
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:11.820]   friends were thinking about maybe making a special edition Drobo available with some
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:14.460]   my photography on the face plate.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.220]   Oh, that would be cool.
[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:19.100]   It's called customizable Drobo's.
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:22.300]   I don't know if we'll be able to pull it off and I hope they don't get mad at me for telling
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.500]   you that, but I'm telling you that because I think it's so cool that people should probably
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.220]   like give us some ideas for how we could pull that off if you want to do it.
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:30.820]   You should do it like you to limit edition.
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.220]   Not only doesn't have a custom art, but you could also give them a lip of a library of
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:37.340]   like some of your greatest photos just for like wallpaper use.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.140]   It's the Scott board limited edition Drobo.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:42.980]   Hey, this is starting to really pan out and the next thing you know, there'll be some sort
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.340]   of Beatles iPod coming with it.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:47.340]   No, no, no, I can't get it.
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.940]   And it should be able to shoot video, Scott.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.580]   Scottboard.com, B-O-U-R-N-E.com.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:55.580]   That's real fun.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:56.580]   Scott, why not Twitter?
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.740]   It's easier if it's some people.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.980]   A lot of people are Twittering Scott these days.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:04.260]   You know, and Leo, you have like a hundred thousand Twitter followers.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.260]   I did not know that.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.620]   Oh, let's not get started on Twitter.
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:09.060]   I get so much hate mail when I use the T word.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:13.260]   But you have like a hundred thousand Twitter followers.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.260]   That's pretty cool.
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.260]   I know.
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:16.460]   That's up there with like the president.
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:19.380]   No, you obviously haven't looked at the list lately.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:20.380]   I haven't.
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.580]   The president has half a million or more.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   Oh my gosh.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.580]   Twitter has been an explosive growth.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:31.220]   I'm a little bit disappointed by that because I have 16, 17,000 followers, but that's by
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.820]   old fashioned door to door canvassing.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.900]   I have never like gotten a hit TV show.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:41.100]   It's like, hey, Mark NBC marketing says, follow my Twitter feed.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.820]   It's crazy that you watch E, you watch any talk show.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:44.820]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:45.820]   You fell in Ellen.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.820]   Yeah, it's a generous.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:47.820]   Yeah, I did.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   That's what broke up.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.420]   Jennifer Aniston and what's his name?
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:52.420]   All right.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.420]   All right.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.420]   All right.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.420]   I guess we have to do the Twitter story.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:56.940]   I wasn't going to do it, kids.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.380]   I really wasn't.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.380]   It's my fault.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:00.580]   Everybody sends me the hate mail anyway.
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.580]   So go ahead.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:02.580]   Jennifer Aniston.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:07.340]   Now, you know, I just saw her cover on GQ.
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:12.460]   I don't know how anybody could ignore Jennifer Aniston, but apparently John Mayer is kind of
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:15.940]   like not, he's ignoring Jennifer Aniston.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.100]   And she's, you know, he says, Oh, hun.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   I'll love you, hun.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.100]   I'm busy.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.100]   I'm in the studio.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:22.100]   I got a record.
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.100]   I'm busy, busy.
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:27.300]   She reads his Twitter's apparently he's got a little more time than she admits to.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.980]   He's Twittering away there going out.
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:30.220]   Having fun.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.220]   She broke up with it.
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:32.620]   She broke up with him over that.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.620]   Would you do that?
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.620]   Larias.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.620]   Yes.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.700]   You lied to me and then I read your tweets and I find out you're not where you're supposed
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:39.700]   to be.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.660]   John Twitter public.
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:46.060]   I bet you Jen is actually a follower of yours.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.340]   I think some people tend to forget that.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.180]   I think people forget when they Twitter that others are reading it.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:54.220]   In fact, I know that when I read some of the things people put up there.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:55.700]   So true.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:02.060]   I wondered that myself was I read your story of your 14 year old son's trip to Hooters.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:03.780]   What that was public.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:10.620]   I don't tweet very much anymore and so I'm just putting comedy bits up there as my new
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:11.620]   thing.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:14.340]   I'm going to just put comedy bits.
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:17.340]   I want to learn to write comedy by using Twitter is my new thing.
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.060]   I'm going to write a book using Twitter.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:23.340]   Anything that says using Twitter too, you're going to make money.
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:24.340]   It's crazy.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.340]   Anyway, enough of that.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:26.340]   Justine's at Justine.
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.340]   IJustine.com.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:28.340]   Is that the best place to go for you?
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:29.340]   Yeah, it forwards.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:30.340]   It forwards.
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:32.340]   It gets to where you're going to be.
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.860]   But it's also mommy packed my lunch.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.500]   It's also tasty blog snacks.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.500]   IJustine.com.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.500]   It forwards.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.500]   It gets to where you need to do.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.380]   She's on TV all the time now doing those mosey ads.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:44.380]   That's fun.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.380]   That's good.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.780]   That was one of your goals in moving to LA is to do commercials and stuff like that.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:49.780]   It wasn't really a goal.
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:52.020]   It was just kind of like if it happens, great.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:54.140]   I mean, the weather's nicer in LA.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.060]   Everybody seems to be there if you need to take a meeting.
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:57.540]   So it's been working out pretty well.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.300]   She's talking like LA type now.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.300]   I'm excited.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.100]   She's taking a meeting.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:04.100]   That's neat.
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:05.980]   Well, I'm glad you come up here once in a while to visit.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:06.980]   It's fun.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   So nice to have you.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:08.980]   Petaluma?
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:10.980]   Well, I'll say I'm just going to say.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.180]   It's going to be such a cute little town.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.180]   It's a cute little town.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.180]   That's the most you can say about it.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:16.180]   It's great.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.180]   I like it.
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.180]   I'm Leo Leforma.
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:19.180]   Don't forget.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.180]   I don't know if you're going to be a vacation destination in California.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:25.180]   When you're on your way to San Francisco and you really need to pee, swing by Petaluma.
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.180]   That's a Justine day.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.180]   I did it.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.380]   I read your tweets.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.140]   You think I'm not following you?
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.140]   I know what's going on.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.700]   I'm reading your tweets.
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:38.620]   Twit.tv is the website where you can follow us on iTunes.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:42.180]   If you want to download any of our shows, we've got dozens of them just to search for

[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:49.220]   We now have a new site called Twit Picks, Twit.tv/Pix, where we take some of the things
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:53.140]   that we mention on the shows, including many of the things we mention on the shows like
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:57.940]   "Cieni and Akko's iPhone fully loaded book, perhaps."
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:01.780]   We highlight them there for your entertainment edification.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:05.680]   Great place to go to see what some of the things that we have picked in the past on these
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.700]   shows, Twit.tv/Pix.

[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.220]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:34.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:37.040]   (upbeat music)
