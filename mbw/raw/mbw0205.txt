[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.040]   your Macintosh needs.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.520]   And I can say that now because we actually
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.840]   will talk about Macintosh today for the first time
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.760]   in a long time.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.880]   Joining us right now from his porch,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.160]   the beautiful on a beautiful Boston day,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.920]   it's Andy and not co of Celestial Waste to bandwidth.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.080]   It's a great day for a tumbler for Ligena and Leo.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.000]   Welcome to I tell you.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   Oh, no, come on.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.240]   That's water.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.200]   We know that is what it is a beautiful day though.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.960]   Look at that.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.720]   It is lovely, especially the day you throw away.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680]   You throw open all the doors, you put in your most colorful
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.840]   summertime frock.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.200]   Yes.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   And just enjoying the daily rebels.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yes.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.240]   I'm enjoying your frock.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.280]   Alex Lindsey is here.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.960]   We don't know how long he's using a MyFi because the fancy
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.400]   hotel Wi-Fi is just not that good.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.840]   I thought I'm bitter.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.600]   So yeah, so it's a brand new hotel.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.120]   And you think that they would have a brand new internet
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.800]   connection that was fast and all those other things.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.760]   But--
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.560]   I think it's probably the case that hotels--
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.160]   Hotel internet is not enough for all of the guests at once.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.480]   And you're just having the bad luck.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.280]   It's almost noon.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.720]   Maybe there's a conference going on in the wild.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.480]   It is a computer graphics conference.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.600]   Oh, no wonder.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.040]   Here is the--
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.880]   Are you down there for SIGGRAPH?
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.680]   What are you down there for?
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.720]   So I'm down here.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.440]   We are covering SIGGRAPH.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.200]   We're going to be doing streaming.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   This week, Media Live tomorrow on pixxscore.tv.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.600]   And we will--
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.240]   or at pixxscore.com.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.040]   And then I'll be doing my typical run around the show
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.400]   and show anything that looks cool.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.720]   So we'll be recording all of those.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   And those will end up on the Mac break
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.200]   and inside the black box, which is
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.280]   we're going to relaunch next week.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.120]   So I'll be running around with cameras and live streams.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.440]   Today is just a--
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.840]   oh, this is going to be hard talking to you, Alex, I think.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.640]   Fortunately, we have somebody to fill in.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.760]   No, no, just hang in there.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.600]   And we'll just live with the robotics.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.080]   And we'll apologize in advance for the Alex's bandwidth.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.320]   Rich Segal is also here.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.200]   He is kind of one of the original Macintosh developers.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.160]   And he also has a bottle of gin from bareloans.com.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.680]   He does, of course, BB Edit, the great text editor
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.440]   that everybody uses.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.080]   Text Wrangler.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.760]   You also have a notepad program.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.040]   Yeah, we have a--
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   it's really a digital junk drawer called Yo-Jimbo.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.400]   Love Yo-Jimbo.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.080]   Thank you.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.800]   I was going to say Yo-Jimbo, and then I thought that can't be right.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.320]   Is it Rachael Mann?
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.560]   What is it?
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   Yo-Jimbo, that's it.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.280]   It's called Floating Wheat Eads.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.640]   It's a competing product.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.560]   Great to have you on.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.480]   In a way, it's nice to have you on today,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.080]   because having a developer--
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.800]   and I like to get developers on the show
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.520]   to talk about the experience of running on the Mac platform.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.000]   But there hasn't been a lot of talk about the Mac platform
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   of late, because Apple's focused so much.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.680]   And we're, as a result, focused so much on mobile,
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.960]   whether it's iPad or iPhone.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.920]   But today, they did us a favor, a little Mitzvah.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.880]   They released a new Macintosh right before we went on the air.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.480]   They refreshed the iMac line to include the i3 i5 and i7.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.400]   And even more, I think, importantly, for a lot of high-end people
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.120]   like you, Alex, they finally let the other shoe drop.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.640]   And they're going to have the 12 core--
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.480]   actually, I think it's dual 6 core Mac pros.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.400]   That's huge.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.160]   That's quite a nice of iron, isn't it?
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.040]   We've been waiting.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.800]   This is the highest end Intel chip that's been out since,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.240]   I think, January.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.960]   It took Apple an uncharacteristically long time
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.760]   to release this.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.680]   And the device itself won't be out till, I think, September.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.600]   Alex, are you excited about the Mac, the new Mac Pro?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.120]   I am.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.240]   I'm very excited about it.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.160]   We've been holding off on getting any more Mac pros,
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.520]   hoping that we're-- this is going to be our way.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.840]   We thought we were going to wait forever.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.000]   I'd love to see a quad version of this.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.640]   It's six cores across four processors would be even better.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.000]   Of course, Apple gave us an inch, and I'm asking for a mile.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   But it seems like they've already
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.680]   got that form factor figured out unless the chips are
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.000]   significantly larger.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.520]   So this is the Nihalum Extreme--
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.320]   or is it a Xeon?
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.400]   It might be a Xeon Extreme processor.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.200]   It's not currently in the store.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.280]   The most they've got right now is the 8 core, which
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   is dual quad cores.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.520]   But this new extreme core from Intel
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   has six cores on one chip.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.000]   So they're going to do a dual, which is a 12 core.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.320]   But you're saying you would like 24--
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   24 crashes.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   A 21 core.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   You know that--
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.160]   This is going to cause five grand for six.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.240]   You want 24.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.920]   So the idea is that Apple will just
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.440]   sell us all one Macintosh, and we can all use it
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.480]   like they're running the country.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.280]   And that's what--
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.480]   You think you have a whole bunch of screens all connected
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.400]   to one machine, that would be just perfect.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   The awesome.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.920]   Awesome.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   That was actually cool.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.040]   Alex, I was actually going to ask you about that.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   He worked like that.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   What is the top--
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.480]   What we define as the top of performance?
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.080]   And what is the limit at which it
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.720]   would be ridiculous to make a machine more powerful than this
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.480]   to put more cores on the mother-mother board?
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.720]   Is there an upper limit?
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.600]   No, not for a pro user.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.120]   I mean, the real limit for a pro user
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.320]   that's doing 3D, that's doing compression, that's doing that
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.440]   is really going to be the bandwidth that gets to those cores.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.880]   So admittedly, it will not help to put more cores in there.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.280]   If there's not enough RAM, if there's not enough to support them,
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.800]   and also if there's not enough bandwidth--
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.160]   and what I mean by bandwidth is the data
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.360]   getting to the actual cores, that starts to turn around
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.600]   to be the bottleneck once the cores get fast enough,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.400]   where you literally can't max them out,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.200]   because you can't get the data to them fast enough.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.760]   And so that might be some of the calculations here.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.200]   They're saying up to 50% speed increase.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.160]   Typically, that's going to be with mathematically heavy resource
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.320]   low problems, because that's where the cores don't need
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   that bandwidth to perform.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.480]   Rich has a programmer.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.760]   Any desire for 12 cores?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.640]   Oh, hell yeah.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.800]   Really?
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.920]   Well, I'm personally interested in these new machines,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.840]   not just because of my software development,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.080]   but also because I use this machine for gaming,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.240]   occasionally, maybe more occasionally, depending on who you
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.560]   ask.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.120]   And so anything that improves baseline performance
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   is just welcome.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.440]   I mean, the faster it goes, the faster I can do stuff.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:27.400]   So 12 cores is 12 GCC compiles going at once in Xcode.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.520]   And as long as the I/O channel can keep those processors filled
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.560]   with data, the thing's just going to run unbelievably fast.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   For what--
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.720]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.480]   I'm just wondering with the solid-state drive offerings
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.080]   that they have.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.800]   They say that you can get up to four, five, 12 gig solid-state
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.320]   drives.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.680]   That would, I guess, then handle the I/O concern.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.960]   You're bottlenecking, yes?
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.560]   Yes and no.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   Certainly you eliminate most of the rotational latency
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.480]   because there's no rotation, obviously.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.680]   Yeah, access time zero.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.160]   Or nearly so.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.480]   But you can still only get three or six gigabits a second
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   off the gigabits gigabytes.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.240]   I forget the order of--
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.560]   Nice gigabytes, yeah.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.400]   Yeah, through the SATA channel.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.960]   So if you can pull that off two or three or four drives at once,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.120]   if your I/O channel can handle that kind of throughput,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.560]   well, that's great.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.200]   But I don't really think you're going to see that.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.120]   What games are you playing, Rich?
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.760]   Lots of World of Warcraft.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.600]   Oh, you don't need this for that?
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.720]   Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.640]   It's not a very heavy duty game.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.520]   Come on.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.080]   And in fact, when I saw the new video specifications,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   the new AMD ATI cards that are available,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.440]   that's even better 512 meg of video RAM standard
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.600]   and upgradable to an even beefier card.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.240]   That's just great.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.920]   And that's one of the things sort of in general
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.840]   where the Mac has always paid a bit of a price
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.160]   is there's been this perception that Apple has been consistently
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.080]   behind the curve when it comes to gaming performance.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.600]   And for the past couple of generations,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.520]   it's been really nice to see them keeping up
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.120]   with what's available, even if they're not exactly the quickest
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.200]   on the draw about it.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.880]   Whenever they do an upgrade or an update,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.640]   you can see that they're sitting on top of things
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.520]   on the hardware side.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.280]   And they're also keeping up with things
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.920]   on the OpenGL software side.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.520]   ATI 5770 is standard.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.360]   The top of the line, 5870 is available with a gigabyte
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.640]   of GDDR5 memory.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.960]   Yeah, that's pretty high performance.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.320]   Always been a problem on the Mac side,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.840]   because unlike the PC where you have many, many choices
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.640]   of cards because it's a standard--
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.760]   kind of standard, a lot of the card manufacturers
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.600]   don't make Macintosh versions of their cars.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.680]   So you always have been a little bit limited.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.240]   A big issue is that typically happens.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.800]   As Apple wants to control the creation of the drivers.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.160]   So you end up with a situation where Apple wants to control them.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.360]   But typically, like Nvidia, especially for the pro level
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.800]   stuff, the quadros, the Nvidia wants to control that.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.000]   And so you get it into the back and forth of who's
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.880]   going to be writing the drivers for these.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.480]   And I think that's been one of the things
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.840]   that really delays a lot of our access to the cards,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.160]   is because Apple wants to do it.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.640]   Because OpenGL is so part of the OS that Apple doesn't--
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.800]   it would have to show things that they don't want to show.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.040]   And so as a result, I think that a lot of people
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.840]   would want to make Mac one, but they can't.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.320]   Apple makes the drive.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.800]   Right.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.160]   I need to be the worm in the Apple here.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.880]   But with this new hardware, Apple is--
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.360]   they put out a press release.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.840]   Of course, they didn't have a press conference.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.960]   In fact, they haven't even changed their front page,
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.400]   except for a little thing down here on the new iMac.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   The big front page splashes the iPhone 4s here,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.920]   and that hasn't changed.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.080]   I mean, it's pretty clear that Apple, even though they're
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.920]   making new Macs, still doesn't see the Mac as--
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.640]   I don't know.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.160]   It's not that they don't see it as important.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.120]   They don't see it as needing marketing, is that it?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.320]   Well, I think that they--
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480]   I really think this is more of what we talked about.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.400]   We talked about it in the past that Apple is really
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.480]   a back burner in the truck.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.040]   I mean, they released a brand new display, a brand new update
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.560]   to their hardware, and a completely new interface
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.120]   to the Mac, the Magic Pad.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120]   Right.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.160]   And they did all of those things and didn't--
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.040]   ran a press release, but that's it.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.520]   I still think that they're back burning that.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.400]   They're like, hey, kid, have a computer.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.120]   They would have-- in past days, I
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.960]   think they would have done a press conference just
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.160]   for the Magic Pad.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.280]   Let's talk a little bit about that.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.600]   This was hotly rumored because of a patent application
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.000]   that Apple had made for a Bluetooth touch pad.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.880]   It's about the same height as the Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.400]   In fact, it's obviously a clear complement
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.480]   to the Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.280]   It's a big trackpad, bigger than the MacBook Pro's trackpad,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.960]   and it has all the multi-touch gestures.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.640]   Andy, is this an important new product from Apple?
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.560]   I'd say so.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.600]   And it's obviously designed to complement
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.120]   their current wireless keyboards,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.640]   the same depth, the same width.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.000]   It will look like just an extension to what you've got right
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.040]   now.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.560]   I think it's kind of significant.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.680]   It's not significant that it's Bluetooth,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.560]   because I think you'd have to put a gun to somebody's head
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.480]   to make Apple put a cord on anything that doesn't absolutely
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.960]   require to have a cord.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   But it's interesting, because it's definitely
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.640]   an incursion of multi-touch into iOS.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.040]   If they want to be more ambitious about support
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.800]   of multi-touch gestures in Mac OS 10.7,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.280]   they're going to need to have a device like this in the field
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.040]   so they can say that, well, it's not just for MacBooks,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.560]   it's for everybody who has desktops as well.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.800]   It also-- you want to put fresh batteries inside your speculation
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.720]   engine.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.800]   A device like this is exactly what you need for good afternoon
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.440]   of just sitting around the campfire
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.360]   and swapping tails about a new Apple TV that
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.520]   builds on iOS and uses this Magic Trackpad
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.640]   as your multi-touch input device iPad applications that now
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.200]   could be used remotely.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.080]   If you want to use the display adapter
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.520]   to turn it into a Roku box or a video projector, well,
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:24.880]   guess what?
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.400]   This is not going to be your projector.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.120]   If you want to use the Mac as a remote game console,
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.720]   now you can have four of these Bluetooth devices attached
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.040]   to the same machine at the same time,
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.280]   with kids holding it like this, like a controller
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.360]   and tapping and spiping.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.160]   It really does invite speculation.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.120]   It's not as though iOS and iOS-based Apple TV
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.800]   would not have been possible without this,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.040]   but it really got me this morning thinking
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.240]   that that would make a hell of a lot of sense.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.600]   Rebuild the Apple TV with an A4 processor,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.760]   build it on iOS.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.840]   It would not be materially different
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.480]   than what we've got right now, but then you
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.040]   have access to the entire app store
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.200]   because everybody who's developing apps for the iPhone
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.920]   and the iPad can now develop apps for the Apple TV.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.640]   It's interesting.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   Again, I really do underscore that this is just Tuesday morning,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.480]   again, pour yourself a big tumbler gin
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.560]   and then just start imagining what you would--
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.040]   if you were a CEO of Apple and you wanted this to happen,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.560]   what this trackpad would mean.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.920]   But it might be just a trackpad, but maybe not.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.760]   That's a really good point because when I first heard
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.880]   about this trackpad, I didn't give it a lot of credence
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.600]   to the rumors only because I thought,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.840]   is there really a big market for a giant trackpad?
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.200]   I mean, what is the market for that?
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.440]   Most people like to use mice.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.000]   They use a trackpad on the laptop
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.400]   because they have to.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.880]   I even know a lot of people who add mice to laptops.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.760]   Yeah, and also you look at how lean and mean
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.280]   Apple's whole product line is, that they don't put a product
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.760]   with a creative product with an Apple logo on it
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.200]   unless it can really support everything else that they're
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.240]   doing.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.000]   And it makes sense in and of itself, if, again, you spec--
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.080]   already you have a bunch of multi-touch gestures
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.120]   that if you look at it this way are available to MacBook users
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.520]   that are not available to desktop users.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.560]   And this product might be just a way to say,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.200]   we have one version of the OS.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.080]   It works exactly the same for everybody.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.160]   If you have a feature in one version of this Mac,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.760]   you will have the feature in all the Macs in the product.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.080]   So it could be as simple as that.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.160]   But it also, if you think about it as a way of,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.880]   they can sort of make those multi-touch gestures expand upon them.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.360]   If they're going to simply say, the Mac is not a system
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.040]   where you're necessarily going to buy a mouse.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.720]   You can also buy this multi-touch pad.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.440]   And if you do, here are all the wonderful ways
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.560]   you can control your machine, maybe even from 10
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.760]   feet away on your sofa.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.360]   Rich, I'm going to guess from using BB Ed,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.760]   that you don't use a mouse at all.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.960]   It's all keyboards for you.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.560]   Actually, I drive with the mouse quite a bit.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.720]   Keyboarding, yes, obviously for code entry,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.760]   there's no really good way to do it.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.800]   But for navigation, for manipulating the interface,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.240]   I think I can even hold it up since it has no wire.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.120]   This very nice Logitech wireless mouse.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.800]   Yep.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.960]   It's the anywhere MX it says on the bottom.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.160]   Rate mouse.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.360]   And it's got the clutch scroll wheel
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.480]   so you can press the button in and go, woo!
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.360]   Yes, exactly.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.240]   It's a great mouse.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.880]   And so I mouse heavily in the UI.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.280]   And as Andy said, the thing that struck me
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.040]   about the magic trackpad is that now you
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.480]   can have a consistent interface, a consistent input interface,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.880]   depending on irrespective of whether you're
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.560]   using a desktop or a laptop.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.600]   Whereas before, it was very clearly divided.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.120]   Laptops used the touchpad and desktops used a mouse.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.960]   And some of you guys may remember many, many, many, many years
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.800]   ago, there was a trackpad interface, a trackpad,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.960]   I think Alps made one.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.680]   They're plugged into your ADB keyboard.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.600]   And there's also the bamboo pad made by Wacom that I use.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.080]   I'm wondering if the bamboo might be a better choice
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.800]   than this.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.400]   It certainly does a little bit more
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.680]   because the bamboo, depending on the model that you get,
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.840]   not all of the bamboo models are larger.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.520]   But on top of everything else, you
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.800]   can also get a model that for just a little bit more
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.920]   will also have a Wacom pressure sensitive pen associated
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.680]   with the two.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.000]   And it doesn't look like this trackpad,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.240]   but this magic trackpad will get you pen input
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.600]   unless you get one of them.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.200]   You get the link sausage input instead.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.280]   I think you're onto something with this idea
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.400]   that this is a piece of the leanback experience
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   of a television product.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.800]   It makes a lot of things possible.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.080]   I start off with the thought, gee, why
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   are they getting into the random accessory role?
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.240]   But then you think that they don't do anything just to,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.840]   because someone, one person at the company,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.440]   wants to do this unless that one person has Steve Jobs.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.600]   Usually it's because it plugs into part of their future
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.120]   strategy.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.040]   So who knows?
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.920]   But interesting.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.680]   I want to talk about more.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.520]   There's new iMacs.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.000]   And I think the most important announcement
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.800]   of this new product line, the new Apple Nickel
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.280]   Metal Hydride battery charger.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.000]   But--
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.960]   I predicted it.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.760]   I called it.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.200]   You all thought I was nuts.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.080]   It's going to revolutionize this industry.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.840]   You laughed, Andy.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.200]   We still think you're nuts.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.520]   I saw the patent filings.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.880]   I didn't believe it.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   And Alex--
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.520]   It's a revolutionary new powering system,
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.600]   where instead of harnessing the energy from your wall,
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.520]   you're harnessing the energy of chemicals of electrons.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.040]   Damn magic.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.400]   We call it iMac.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.960]   Wireless power.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.840]   Alex, are you still there?
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.560]   We've lost the video.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.240]   But I think we still have you on audio, yes?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.440]   I'm still here.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.480]   He's just fading away.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.880]   You actually said it better when you were in Africa.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.360]   He's in Los Angeles, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:54.800]   I did.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.120]   And you know, I'm going to be--
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.760]   It looks like I'll be back in Africa in September.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.120]   And I'm almost certain that I will both look and sound better.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.440]   You have better bandwidth.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:05.880]   LA.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.600]   So folks, just so you know, LA is now a third world nation.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.960]   Before we continue on, though, let me mention our friends
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.880]   at Citrix and go to my PC.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.480]   If bandwidth is an issue, go to my PC
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.160]   is a very good choice because it maximizes your screen
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.280]   refreshes and maximizes the speed with which you
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.960]   can operate with a remote computer with some very
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.840]   Trixie stuff.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.680]   I mean, these guys have been doing remote access longer
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.800]   than anybody.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.040]   They were the first to use things like Delta screen
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   deltas and things like that to really speed up your movement
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.240]   on screen.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.160]   The screen refreshes.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.760]   It's really quite amazing.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.920]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.400]   If you want to try it Mac or Windows,
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.320]   it allows you to access a computer remotely anywhere
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.320]   you can get online.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.040]   You just open up your web browser.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   You go to go to my PC.com/log in and boom.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.920]   There's your computer.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.960]   Your office computer when you're at home.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   Your home computer, if you're on the road, whatever computer
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.560]   you decide to put code on my PC on is accessible.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.720]   Securely, I might add, password protected, 128-bit SSL.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.160]   No one else can use it.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.200]   But you can.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.840]   You can access your computer and work on any program,
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.200]   access any file, check email, even access network
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.800]   resources.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.200]   They're all available to you just as if you were at your desk,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   but you're not.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:27.840]   You're at home.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.560]   You're on the road.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.720]   You're enjoying life.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.480]   Go to my PC.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.600]   Couldn't be easier to install.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.360]   In fact, if you go right now to go to my PC.com/Macbreak,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.920]   you'll have installed before I'm done talking.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.440]   It's that simple.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.640]   And once you've got it installed, just go on vacation.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.040]   Enjoy yourself.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.080]   You're going to love it.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.360]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.000]   Give it a try free today.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.080]   Leo LaPorte here with Andy Inato from his beautiful porch
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.680]   on a beautiful summer day in Dedham, or not Dedham,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.800]   down the road from Dedham.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   You're actually down the road from Rich Segal, who's also
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.040]   with us, along with Bruno the Parrot.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.520]   And Andy and Rich have been joined by phone
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.800]   by the virtual ghost-like voice of Alex Lindsay.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.840]   Hey, Leo, can you try me on video one more time?
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.200]   Sure.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.280]   I'm feeling adventurous.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.480]   I'm open for anything.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.680]   He's walking towards the line.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.480]   That's why I was the only good looking guy on the bright side.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.280]   That's it.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:32.120]   So new iMacs, finally moving to the i3 i5.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.720]   And even i7, if you want to do a build-to-order line
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.520]   of the Intel chips.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.080]   This is a typical slipstream upgrade,
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.000]   the kind of upgrade we've seen from Apple before.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.800]   Nothing spectacularly new, just faster processors.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.880]   I presume faster video as well, although I haven't
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.400]   looked into it.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.760]   That's the case, Rich.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.840]   Yes, the video options have been substantially
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.760]   upgraded as well.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.440]   And again, it's nice to see that happening.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:05.080]   Because for a while, and perhaps arguably even now,
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.520]   the new iMacs, or the current generation,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.840]   the iMacs of the past year or so, have really
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.280]   been first-class desktop workstations.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.720]   It used to be that the iMac was sort of a cost
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.000]   reduced second-run, second-tier performance machine.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.640]   It was basically a laptop inside a computer, big screen.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.480]   In many ways, right?
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.240]   And it was definitely tuned and priced for consumer use
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:32.880]   in the home.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.360]   But lately, beginning really with the aluminum iMacs
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.680]   and continuing with the latest generation,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.800]   they really, really come into their own in terms
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.400]   of performance and usefulness for professional work.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.280]   Obviously, they're not internally expandable for disk storage.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.600]   So if you're doing a lot of content generation,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.840]   if you're doing a lot of video, I
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.120]   suspect that you might find them coming up short.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.840]   But again, as gaming machines, as developer workstations,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.600]   and for 90% of the market, they're really nice machines.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.360]   ATI Radeon, the 4670, or the 5670, if you upgrade.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.800]   Yep.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.680]   And I think that in itself might explain some of the slowness
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.160]   that we've seen when it comes to Mac Pro upgrades.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.560]   Because the iMac is all many, probably 80% of the market
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.480]   needs, maybe 90% of the market needs.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   And I think Apple moves a lot more iMacs.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:41.600]   I think they make a lot more money for unit on an iMac sale.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:49.720]   And so the Mac Pro, as lovely and desirable as it is computationally,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.880]   really is the machine for 10% or 20% of the market.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.520]   And that makes it a harder sell.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.040]   And I think it's--
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.640]   I'm going to guess that it's even less than 20% of the market.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.920]   As someone who has a bunch of these machines,
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.000]   I think that we're really looking at a very
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.880]   a fraction of the market.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.600]   It scares me because I need these machines.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.840]   But I was teaching a 3D class last week in Philadelphia.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.040]   And there was no reason we were using iMacs.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.600]   Why not?
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.400]   Why not?
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.120]   And they weren't even the newest ones.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.680]   And they worked great.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.360]   And that's the problem.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.440]   So I don't know what's going to happen with the Mac Pro.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.680]   One could argue that there's always a place
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.760]   for a high end statement machine.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.480]   Some car manufacturers do this.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.920]   They have high end statement cars that
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.840]   a very, very small portion of their audience will purchase.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   But from a business standpoint, it's
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.560]   hard to argue that you'd want to keep that sort of thing
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.600]   going forever unless you can really afford to do it.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.320]   So I am unwilling to predict what might come next for the Mac
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:01.880]   Pro.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.760]   But--
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.160]   I could tell you what's coming next in my Mac Pro.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.960]   StarCraft 2, I'm excited.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.280]   I'm surprised with your world of Warcraft
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.120]   that you're not a StarCraft player.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.680]   Well, you know, I may be about to come one.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.600]   But stay away from the South Koreans.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.760]   It's all I can say.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.960]   These guys are insane.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.920]   The other thing is this Mac Pro that I have here
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.680]   is a 2006 machine.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.960]   It's four years old.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.800]   And it's probably pretty fast still, right?
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.400]   Oh, it's awesomely fast.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.640]   It's a great machine.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   And it could be the last of the long service life machines.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.760]   Perhaps that's how you look at a Mac Pro as a long service
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.280]   life machine.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.240]   Well, I'm even sitting in front of an iMac
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.600]   that I got a couple of years ago.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.960]   It was the extreme at the time.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.200]   So it's 3 gigahertz core 2.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.600]   And I don't feel any real pressure to upgrade.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.280]   What is it that's putting a demand on the desktop these days?
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.960]   I would guess it's the same in the Windows side.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.360]   Is that people don't feel the urge to upgrade.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.720]   It's a little different in Windows.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.040]   Because nobody wants to install Windows.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.240]   So they buy a new computer when a new version of Windows
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.680]   comes out.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.880]   But that's not the case of the Mac sign.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.160]   Yeah, I think it's more tied to OS upgrades
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.920]   when you finally have the one version of the operating system
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.080]   that finally invalidates every G4 processor.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.960]   That's when the G4 users will upgrade to whatever's coming.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.200]   And they're also probably not going to be going for--
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.560]   But didn't that already happen, really?
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.280]   I mean, yeah.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   It tends to happen every three years, both explicitly
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.680]   when suddenly there's something on the side of the box that
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.160]   requires G5 or better or requires a core do--
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.880]   Intel core, duo, or better.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.680]   But mostly it's a question of performance
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.480]   where you'll have one new library that just needs
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.280]   this graphics acceleration order really work.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.000]   One new tweak to the user interface
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.960]   that it kind of works OK if you have older hardware.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.920]   But if you have something built in the past two years,
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.840]   boy will it ever sing.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.840]   But one of the things that keep telling people
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.800]   when they're trying to make the decision between Mac and PC
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.720]   is that Macs tend to hold on to their utility
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.200]   far longer than a Windows machine.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.120]   They tend to get orphaned far less frequently.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.240]   My one current use desktop Mac is an iMac.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.480]   And I believe it's the 2007 model.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.520]   And it's not like I'm just doing word processing
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.400]   and getting email on it.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   I also do Final Cut Express on it.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.000]   I do a lot of aperture work on it.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.840]   And yes, I can definitely tell the difference between doing
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.440]   edits and aperture on a faster machine
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.840]   and doing it on the sine Mac.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.840]   But still it's plenty fast enough for me.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.560]   And I'm not looking to replace it anytime in the near future.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.120]   I think it's telling that none of us know exactly what
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.560]   your Macs are.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560]   You don't need to anymore.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   And that really has to keep working.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.760]   That's a big defect.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.440]   We want to buy new shiny things, but we don't need to.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.960]   Well, we're spending them all on phones and iPads these days.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   And maybe accessories like the magic.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.440]   Exactly.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.360]   There's looking at everybody.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.160]   Yeah, $69 for the magic pad, by the way.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.440]   That seems a little pricey for what is essentially
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.240]   an input device.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.000]   Well, when you consider that a premium house
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.960]   will cost you about $49.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.720]   And a cheap tablet will cost you about $80 to $90.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.160]   I guess you're right.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.800]   It's probably about $49.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.920]   It's definitely not priced at giveaway prices.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.400]   It's not priced at saturation prices, shall we say.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.840]   I'm really curious to see if they've
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.360]   stuck with the design.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   Since it's a Bluetooth device, it seems
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.400]   to have the same design as on the Bluetooth keyboard,
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.240]   where there's a nice nicely sculpted design flag
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.640]   that round thing.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.600]   And which is nice.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.240]   But the problem is that I find that when I travel, at least
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.840]   with my Bluetooth keyboard, it's very, very likely
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.360]   that that button is going to get bumped.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.520]   And then suddenly, that keyboard is
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.040]   going to be looking for devices to connect to.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.680]   And suddenly, my iPhone is waking up,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.200]   and my iPad is waking up, and the batteries and the keyboard
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   are running down.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.600]   And really, that's the time in which I
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   wish that Johnny and I was born in love
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.000]   with old-fashioned 1973 toggle switches, then sleek.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.920]   Like, give me a mechanical click switch
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.960]   that either is on or off, and that's it.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.280]   I'm clear, you're going to see if they've
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.600]   done anything different with this.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.760]   Go ahead, Rich.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.920]   I was going to say the kind of switch with a flip cover over.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.240]   Yeah, that's what we need, a flip cover.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.800]   All I'll say is that, given that I always, whenever
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.280]   I travel with these keyboards, I take out the batteries.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.520]   That can't be a positive comment on the design.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.280]   Yeah, Alex, go ahead.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.960]   You know, as someone who is a pretty heavy user of the Wacom
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.800]   bamboo, which I just think is the greatest little input device,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   I think the only thing that would tempt me really
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.360]   away from that for regular use would be, number one,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.160]   I'd love to make sure that if I could do multi-touch--
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.320]   all the same multi-touch stuff there, it would be great.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   And also, touch sensitivity.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.720]   I mean, or pressure sensitivity.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.400]   A pressure sensitivity was in there.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.280]   And that's the case for both the iPad and the iPhone
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.440]   and the input devices is just a little bit of touch sensitivity,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.960]   not even at the same level of the high-end Wacoms
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.520]   or Wacoms or whatever you want to call them.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.520]   But 256 or even 128 levels would make a huge difference
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.360]   in the kind of applications that could be created.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.920]   Also, and I'm excited about this.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.240]   It won't be available until September.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.680]   The Mac Pro not until next month, in September,
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.120]   we'll be able to see 27-inch cinema displays,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.000]   16 by 9 aspect ratio.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.240]   It's going to look a little bit weird.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.080]   It's going to be a wide screen.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.360]   But a very good price, $999, just $200,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.040]   over the 24-inch display Apple selling now.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.720]   Still not competitive.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.080]   I have to say that as somebody who paid $2,500
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.400]   for a 30-inch Apple cinema display five years ago,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.560]   I am outraged.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.920]   Outraged, I tell you.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.360]   Yeah, I think it's a good deal.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.520]   I'm excited about that.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.760]   Yeah, no, the new displays look great.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.720]   And the price certainly seems to be competitive.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.160]   And I am happy to see that the big billboard display
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.520]   isn't going away.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.160]   The 30-inch?
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.080]   Well, the 30-inch itself, I'm sure,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.640]   is going to get discontinued as soon as the 27 is available.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.040]   But in general terms, that 2560 wide.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.720]   And yeah, the new one is 16 by 9, and the old one was 16 by 10.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.760]   I mean, in general, just having a display that wide
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.840]   is great to have around.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.600]   I get tremendous amounts of work done online.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.040]   We years ago figured out that there
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:31.600]   was a very clear relationship between build times and display
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.720]   size and the bigger the screen, the faster your builds are.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.200]   Really?
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   Is that true?
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.600]   Well, that was the story that everybody told me
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.200]   to get to the 5-inch.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.040]   It is true that all the research shows
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.480]   you're much more productive with a larger screen.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.360]   And I bet that's really true of people who are coding
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.400]   or doing graphics of any kind, anything where you have
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.480]   multiple screens and windows open.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.000]   I used to poo people because I was like,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.600]   I worked on Star Wars on a 17-inch screen.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.400]   You can work on--
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400]   You can work on--
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.560]   Good.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.400]   And I have to admit that now our standard purchase is a 30
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   and a 24.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.280]   And that was Eric's idea, actually, on your side.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.080]   He wanted to get a 30 and 24th college too much.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.200]   That's one of each, 130, one big one.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.600]   Is that for-- what is that for the timeline?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.840]   Is that for--
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.080]   Well, yeah, what you can do is you can put--
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.400]   like, as we get new ones, that's what we've been buying.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.160]   So you can put interface stuff.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   You can put timelines--
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.560]   On the 24.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.760]   On the 24, and then you have just one big screen.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.840]   And we still-- there's 24 of the minimum.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.360]   We try to get as many 30-inch screens out there as possible.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.200]   But we've been kind of--
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.920]   as we buy new computers, the standard setup is the Mac Pro
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.240]   with three drives installed, a fast card, and two monitors.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.720]   Because it really does speed things up a lot.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.560]   It's one of those little things that goes a long way.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.520]   Also, a new battery charger, which actually
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.920]   is pretty competitively priced.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.040]   You get, what is it, six nickel metal hydride batteries?
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.880]   It's a two battery charger.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   So where is it for?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.240]   I believe it's a two battery--
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.560]   It's like two battery at a time charger.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.160]   What I was trying to find in the tech specs
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.400]   is it doesn't tell you how many milliamps you get.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.280]   So you don't know exactly how powerful they are.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   I would guess it's 27 or 2800, which
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.400]   would put it competitively with what most nickel metal hydride
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.880]   rechargeable batteries go for.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.760]   It is definitely cheaper than what
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   you would pay for for a set of energizers.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.640]   They're also making the green statement that in.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   When the batteries are charged up, it uses--
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.560]   I think they're saying it uses 15% of the energy
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   that an average battery charger uses after the batteries
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.920]   have been topped up.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.000]   So it uses a very, very--
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.400]   It's not like it keeps like vampiring power off of your power
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.080]   all at first place.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.840]   It's a pretty good deal.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.960]   30 bucks for five nickel metal hydride batteries and chargers
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.160]   is very competitive, I think.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.880]   And surprisingly, it uses the same power core adapter
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.120]   as all your other accessories.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.720]   So if you have international adapters
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.360]   that work with your other power bricks, it'll work with this too.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.960]   Interesting, isn't it, though?
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.120]   I mean, the only products that they're mentioning in it
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.760]   are that when you want to recharge your wireless keyboard,
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.320]   your batteries are close at hand.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.800]   And I thought that one of the things
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.760]   that they were talking about the wireless keyboard earlier
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.640]   is that you won't even need to carry a battery charger because
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.600]   it uses power so sparingly.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.360]   So it's a curious item on the product.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.320]   It's their green thing, isn't it?
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.680]   I mean, they're just trying to be green.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   Well, they're not--
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.160]   That's the reason why the press release for the screens
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.200]   and the new iMacs tell you about how recyclable
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.520]   the display technology is.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.840]   That's not the reason why they would commit to doing
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   a whole new product, is it?
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.800]   So what do you think, Rich?
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.600]   To be honest, I'm not really sure what to make.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.440]   I'm looking at the battery charger info now
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.760]   and in the store, there aren't any tech specs.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.440]   So yeah, as Andy says, there's nothing about their capacity.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.600]   I mean, obviously, you're not going to make a diehard ad
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   with these things.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.360]   It's interesting.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.200]   There's six of them so you can have a pair in your magic mouse
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.320]   or your trackpad.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.520]   You can have a pair in your keyboard--
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.000]   And then a pair in the charger.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.160]   And you can have a pair on standby.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:25.520]   So I wonder if it's sort of one of these confluences of--
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.360]   people are always complaining about the batteries dying
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.760]   on their peripherals and there's a market opportunity
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.720]   to hop in here and say, OK, well, not only do we have a solution,
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:46.320]   but we now have a solution that involves recharging and reusing.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.760]   Instead, we have a message that involves reduction and reuse
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.880]   instead of discarding old batteries, which I think is by no means bad.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.840]   This sounds like a Steve thing.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.440]   If we're going to make a lot of things that require batteries,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.960]   we better really strongly push people towards rechargeers.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.400]   I was going to say it's part of an end to end thing now.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.640]   All of our peripherals take batteries now.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.080]   Got the trackpad, got the mouse, got the keyboard.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.760]   They all take batteries.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.680]   And so now the message is, OK, here's one last step in the chain.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.080]   Well, and I don't think this is going to be even a last step,
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.960]   I think that the issue is that Apple has a constituency
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.120]   that will spend a little bit more for it to be designed a little bit better,
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.760]   for it to work a little bit better.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.720]   And there's no reason why they can't keep on just adding more
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.800]   of these little add-ons and everything from bumpers to the gears
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.480]   to everything else.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.640]   There's no reason why they can't keep on building
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.560]   that vertical market out to anything that touches the computer
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.240]   or their iPhone, that they're building something
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.280]   that is just a little bit more expensive,
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.480]   but it's also just a little bit more refined.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.720]   I don't know.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.360]   But at least when they're building that bumper case,
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.880]   the reason why that they built that
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.440]   was because they're the only people who have access
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.800]   to the new shape and the new size of the new iPhone.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.280]   So that was definitely not only an opportunity for them,
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.080]   but also they could tell themselves, well, also, we're going to be giving people--
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.480]   we're going to be the only source for at least a month and a half.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.920]   Let's make sure that this product is out there,
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.480]   because our customers want cases with batteries.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.000]   They can get batteries just about anywhere.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.600]   I mean, if you extend this launch fix to silly lengths,
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   it also opens the door to, well, we're also
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.680]   going to be selling vegetarian burritos,
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.240]   because our CEO is a vegetarian.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.880]   And we think that it'd be good for everybody
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.000]   if they stop eating the pork burritos as you get a chipotle.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.640]   You know, I can see them doing that.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.200]   In fact, Steve's wife for a while
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.160]   was going to do a vegetarian food line, I believe.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.960]   So just don't put the Apple logo on it.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.560]   Maybe that's another--
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.200]   I don't know.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.960]   Are we looking at iPhone 5 with like--
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.440]   so it runs on 6 AA's?
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.400]   I don't know.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.480]   If they started making coffee at the Apple store,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.000]   do we think people would buy it?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.200]   Yes.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.520]   I think yes.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.840]   Apple branded coffee beans.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.400]   Apple beans.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.680]   Yeah, they know.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.160]   But what's interesting is that--
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.080]   I guess there's a little Apple premium on this.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.920]   You probably could get six nickel metal hydrides
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.520]   and a charger for less than $30, but not much less.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   There's not a huge premium on this.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.240]   Well, OK.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.920]   So I'm actually looking at the Amazon product page
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.360]   for a product that I have used and enjoyed for quite a long time.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.480]   And it's a lacrosse technology battery charger.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.280]   I use that too.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.320]   I love it.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.360]   It comes with-- the bundle that I'm looking at is--
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.120]   it's $42.50.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.040]   Three bucks more.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.200]   And $13, I think.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.800]   Actually.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.320]   OK.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.800]   That's right.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.160]   And it comes with some of their own branded nickel
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.040]   metal hydrides.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.920]   But these rechargeable batteries are widely available
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   in many brands.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.320]   And it's a smart charger.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.480]   I can't speak to its power draw.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.080]   I'm sure that it is one of the offending chargers that
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.200]   draws too much power.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.440]   But it's very practical.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.160]   Lars gets them an enormous workout,
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.920]   because there's a Nintendo Wii in the house,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   and there's an Xbox.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.920]   And so there's lots of game controllers
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.000]   that need AA's all the time.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.120]   But yours-- I think mine does.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.720]   It has gauges on it to say you can recharge the batteries.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   You could say how much the charge is, how long--
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.360]   I mean, it's got a lot of information on it.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.240]   It's LCDs for each.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.440]   And it's six batteries, as I remember.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.760]   Yeah, it holds four batteries.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.520]   The charger charges four batteries.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.120]   Four, OK.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.840]   It's a very geeky, very tweaky, techie thing in a way
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.680]   that I think Apple respects a lot of their customers.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.280]   Don't want to have to fuss with them.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.600]   Certainly I don't fuss with it.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.520]   I just put the batteries in and charge them.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:43.960]   Anyway.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.840]   But I don't know how we got 15 minutes out
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   of a battery charger.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.080]   But--
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.440]   And that is the battery charger.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.080]   That's the battery charger that can get us in the 15 minutes.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.200]   It's a stupid battery charger.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.560]   Well, I think we skipped over one thing.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.760]   I mean, it's Apple AA batteries.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.160]   We should just be happy they fit in any AA battery holder.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.520]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.200]   Don't have to buy a special Nintendo
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.720]   Wii in order to use these things.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.240]   I'm a little disappointed, to be honest,
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.040]   that they don't come with an iPod connector on them.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.040]   See, that would be interesting if they sold
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:24.880]   like an officially supported like 4 AA battery iPod power
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.400]   or iPhone power adapter.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.960]   And if you really committed to that--
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   Wow.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   With a hand crank and a little windmill.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   Speaking of the--
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.160]   A treadmill for the hamster.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.440]   Speaking of the bumper cases, I ordered mine immediately.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.400]   And I'm very happy to say that my iPhone will be able to get
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.720]   normal antenna reception September 2.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.520]   So it's a little bit of a delay, although I'm starting
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.560]   to see on the net, people are saying who got the same email
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.760]   from Apple that Apple said that there's our shipping.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.040]   So I guess it really is a question of how many they can
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   crank out and at least is free.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.160]   I wonder how many people reacted exactly the same way
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.760]   that I did where we didn't--
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.360]   I didn't go from by style.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.440]   I didn't go by need.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.640]   I immediately went on Amazon and found out which one of these
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.920]   cases is the most expensive one they're offering.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.320]   That's the one that I want.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   I want the two-piece carbon fiber.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.360]   That's because of spec case that goes for $34.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.600]   That's the one I want.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.400]   You did it by price and--
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.160]   Of course I did.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.920]   I already have a black bumper case.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.440]   And so for one of them.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.120]   So I had another coming in.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.640]   It's like, why would I want to get anything less than the
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.480]   most expensive?
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.520]   I'm an American for God's sake.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.200]   What do we think about this crazy-ass rumor that the
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.680]   reason-- and it keeps coming up-- the white iPhone is delayed
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.600]   is because not because of the paint color, not because of
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.960]   any production difficulties.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.040]   By the way, those don't seem very credible reasons.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.880]   I mean, you would think they'd have figured out how to make
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.360]   these things before announcing them.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.200]   But for whatever reason, people are saying, no, no, the
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.000]   white iPhone's going to have a new antenna design.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.480]   You believe that, Rich?
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.520]   How much profanity am I allowed to use in expressing just
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.720]   how stupid I think that I'd be using?
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.760]   You could say it's bullpucky.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.560]   Get the other card out there.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.080]   Bullpucky.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.320]   That's got to be the most ridiculous thing I've heard.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.360]   It doesn't seem possible.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.160]   I know how long.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:25.080]   You know, I can see Apple doing an ECO, doing an
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.160]   engineering change to address something in the
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.000]   manufacturing process for the antenna.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.040]   But the notion that they're just holding up the white
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.880]   iPhones for that, no.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.480]   It was already previously disclosed.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.240]   I forget the source for that now.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.720]   But it's around there out on the internet somewhere,
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.360]   like it's believable.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:55.280]   That they were having yield issues with the white finish.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:55.640]   I think--
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.480]   Because the tech process--
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.080]   I was saying that.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.160]   I can't remember.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.080]   That's possible.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.720]   And that, to me, is--
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.520]   And gadget said that.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.120]   And gadget.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.360]   To give them credit.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.480]   And they haven't had issues in the past with white.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.000]   I mean, having there been yellowing and stuff like that.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.600]   There has been yellowing.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.680]   That's a very good point.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.320]   Yeah, the white MacBooks, the plastic on the white.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.440]   Yeah, they were horrible.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.960]   That's why I found that explanation very, very credible.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.280]   I mean, if they could get them all the exact same color,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.200]   that wouldn't be a problem.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.240]   But I think the problem was that they're looking at, here are
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.600]   50 white iPhones.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.960]   And there are four different shades of white inside the sample.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.360]   We want to make sure that if any two people hold their iPhones
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.040]   next to each other, white will be white will be white.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.440]   That makes sense.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.000]   And I think it still was related to the antenna
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.280]   in the fact that Apple is extreme--
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.800]   like before, they might have put it out.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.040]   And I think that at this point, they
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.280]   are extremely sensitive to any kind of pushback.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.360]   So if there's two variations, and if there's one variation that
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.720]   shows up every 50 phones, I think that Apple would be tempted
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.880]   to not release it because they want
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.800]   to make sure that they don't have to deal with another antenna
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.300]   again.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.680]   Right.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.440]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.520]   When we come back, we're going to talk about change gears
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:09.800]   a little bit.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.880]   Talk about a very big change in copyright law in the US.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.560]   You can now reverse engineer your dongles.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.720]   But before we get to that, let us mention our friends at Gazelle.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.880]   If you are looking-- if you're a hankering for a new iPhone--
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.000]   and I'm sure many of you are--
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.720]   you're probably saying, but, but, Kali, what am I
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.760]   going to do with the old iPhone?
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.600]   Or worse, how am I going to get the money out
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.320]   of the old iPhone to pay for this?
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.520]   Well, here's the beauty part.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.480]   Gazelle, my friends, will buy your iPhone from you.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.160]   I want you to go to Gazelle.com, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.680]   Gazelle is a really neat service that buys your gadgets.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.680]   Gives you a fair price for it.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.720]   They'll send you a box.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.360]   You pop the gadgets, and you can do multiple gadgets in one box,
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:55.760]   by the way.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.040]   That's kind of handy.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.320]   You pop your stuff in the box, send it back to Gazelle.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.040]   Their product experts evaluate it, erase any data that's
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.520]   on it, and then send you a check.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.360]   Cajets in 20 different categories--
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.120]   Xboxes, PlayStations, Wees, GPS, video games, laptops, cameras,
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.040]   e-book readers, mp3 players, and, of course, smartphones.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.120]   And you get cash, or, if they're not worth anything,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.000]   they will recycle them responsibly for you.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.960]   So look, if you've been sitting on a lot of electronics
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.640]   and thinking, what am I going to do with this?
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.200]   Don't have a garage sale.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.520]   You could do it on eBay, I guess.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.240]   But why not let Gazelle sell it for you?
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.480]   And if you want a 5% bonus payment for your used gadgets,
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.120]   go to Gazelle.com and use the bonus code MACBreak2.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.120]   That's MACBreak and the number two.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   And Gazelle will send you 5% additional over and above,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.920]   over and above the price that promise you online.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.600]   So it's very simple.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.160]   You just go to Gazelle.com.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.320]   You enter in whatever it is the device you're going to sell.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.840]   It's, let's say, I've got a--
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:04.560]   oh, I don't know-- Apple iPhone 3GS 16 gigabytes.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.520]   Make a call successfully?
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.560]   Yes, free of water damage.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.760]   Yes, by the way, I love this here.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:12.840]   The graph below it showing the price as it's gone up and down.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.520]   It's been going down quite a bit ever since the iPhone 4
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:15.800]   came out.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.440]   And then they project what the price will be next month,
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.200]   the month after, the month after that.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:25.120]   So you get an idea of what the price delta is.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.400]   Let's say it's in good condition.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.200]   I have the AC adapter and original cables.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.680]   And it'll tell you how much it's worth $122.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.560]   They'll send you the box.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.360]   You pop it in there.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.400]   If it matches what you said, they'll send you the check.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.160]   If you want more information, the live chats
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.200]   available on their web page right now, 9am to 10pm Eastern
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.280]   time, just go to Gazelle.com.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.160]   And don't forget, when you add it to the box
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.720]   to use MACBreak2 as a special coupon code,
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.200]   you get 5% more off.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   It is such a great deal.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.520]   Responsible recycling too.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.680]   And if you're a nonprofit, a great way to raise money,
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.640]   Gazelle will set up a product page, a cake sale page for you.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.200]   And we're trying to raise money for uniforms
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.320]   for the soccer team.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.640]   You set up the Gazelle page.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.200]   And then just tell everybody, send your gadget to Gazelle
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.040]   and we get the money.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.200]   It's a great way to raise money.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.120]   G-A-Z-E-W-L-E.com.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   Don't just sell it.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   Gazelle it.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   Use the MACBreak2 coupon code for a special deal.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.040]   Librarian of Congress has freed our phones.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:32.640]   Hallelujah.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.480]   Free at last.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.040]   Free at last.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.400]   Periodically, Librarian of Congress does this.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.040]   He is the keeper of the copyright.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.840]   Of course, the DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.600]   determines really what is copyright, what is fair use
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.560]   and all of that.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.600]   But every once in a while, the Librarian of Congress
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   will issue a ruling that explains, enhances, elaborates it.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.920]   Apparently, it has the force of law.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.480]   It's not just some guy saying, who I think is this.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.960]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, part of the Digital Millennium
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.840]   Copyright Act requires them to every three years
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.240]   hear petitions for modifications to it.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.760]   So the idea being that when this was ratified,
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.840]   something like 10, 15 years ago was it, the idea was that,
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.760]   as technology changes, to make sure
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.200]   that something that was a good idea back in the Clinton
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.040]   administration is still a good idea
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.800]   or is now no longer a good idea.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.040]   So it was-- we really had the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.000]   to thank, because they're the ones who prepared all these briefs
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.040]   for this periodic reexamination.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.120]   Yeah, glad you said that, Andy.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.680]   I really want to give EFF credit.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.960]   I'm a monthly donor to the EFF, because I just
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.920]   think they do such good work.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.560]   And this is a very good example.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.720]   They filed the briefs.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.960]   And it wasn't, by the way, just for phone users.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.760]   Two years ago, the Librarian said that it is legal to unlock
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.360]   a phone, a used phone.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.760]   It's legal to do so you own it.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.480]   They clarified that this time around.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.280]   They said, yes, it really is.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.520]   And they also said it's legal to jailbreak a phone.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.600]   That is, to modify the phone so it could run software,
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.640]   not authorized by the company, as long as it's legal software
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.040]   in its own right.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:08.640]   They also said things like librarians and professors
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:14.280]   and teachers can unlock CDs or DVDs for using clips
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.160]   in a fair use context in education.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.280]   Yeah, they specifically said that fair use does apply
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.520]   to things like commentary, even satire education.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:30.640]   It still doesn't affect specifically ripping a DVD
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   for using your own library.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.960]   That wasn't affected by this particular finding.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.480]   But now you can't stop someone from doing a--
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.200]   from including a review of the Phantom Menace that
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.840]   includes clips from the Phantom Menace DVD
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.640]   and putting it on YouTube.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.400]   It's kind of huge.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.840]   I mean, it's always--
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.680]   One of the things about the DMCA is there
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.440]   was no fair use provision in it.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.000]   Well, it said that it was OK to do some things,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.760]   but not other things.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.920]   I think the big problem that was--
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.800]   that's been created, that the EFF was trying to fight here,
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.960]   was that corporations were abusing
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.080]   the Digital Millennium Copraic Act.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.360]   Apple was saying that, well, no, you can't jailbreak your phone
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.640]   because you can't distribute this application for jailbreaking
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.720]   iPhones because that violates our copyright
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.640]   under the precision provisions of the Digital Millennium
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.560]   Copraic Act that is absolutely illegal
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.040]   and will turn the federal government on you
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.680]   because you're violating the law and the Library of Congress
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.720]   has said, no, because this guy is not
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.600]   giving away free copies of your iPhone operating system.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.400]   They're just releasing a utility that will exploit a security
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.560]   hole that you yourself left inside the product
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.120]   to make it do things that the customer who owns this phone
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.160]   wants to make it do.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.240]   That is definitely not something the Library of Congress
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.080]   cares about.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.400]   Go peddle your papers.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.000]   So it also gave professors the right
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   to do research on copy protection
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.640]   and not be liable for that.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.240]   And it means you can also reverse engineer a dongle.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.560]   That is horrible dongles.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.400]   Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.240]   One of the specific call-outs for this one
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.000]   was that if you have a piece of software that's
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.720]   like five years old and it requires a dongle in order
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.800]   to make it work, and sometimes these are thousands of dollars
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.080]   with a software, just one single installation.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.600]   And if this company goes out of business,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.160]   it is not a violation of the DMCA to use an exploit
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.760]   to remove the copy protection from that piece of software.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.200]   Because otherwise, your software would be unusable.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.680]   Again, consistently, this is--
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.560]   Go ahead.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.680]   Is it only that?
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.160]   Can you reverse engineer the dongle at any point in time
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   or home?
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.000]   No, no, no.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.640]   Not universally.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.440]   If it's still copy protection to prevent you
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.760]   from copying the software, the specific exemption
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.000]   that they applied this time is that if there's no other way
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.600]   to run this software because the company stops supporting
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.760]   your computer or stops supporting that product,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.800]   then as someone who legally purchased a copy of the software,
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.640]   you still have the right to use it.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.400]   And if the only way to use it is to remove this copy protection,
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   then that's what you got to do.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.480]   For orphan dongles, Alex.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.080]   Orphan dongles only.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:54.560]   Right.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.400]   Pulled it off.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.120]   And little orphans are now allowed to be reverse engineered.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.360]   Lisa, can I have an install?
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.520]   Apple's response, the canned response, the only one
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.840]   they could give is, well, it still violates our warranties.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.280]   And that's all they could really--
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.080]   I mean, I wrote a column this morning about it that says,
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.760]   that's great because it's good that the court has said
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.680]   that the fact that you paid a lot of money for this device
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.960]   means that you have a right to do certain things to it
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.160]   that the company that sold it to you
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.040]   doesn't necessarily might not like.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.800]   But it also still means that jailbreaking a phone will still
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.480]   give you access to a very tiny library, a very poor software,
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.600]   of which maybe four of these utilities
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.360]   are worth their time, mostly Nintendo
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.720]   and the Apple's email, which is a very good thing.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.520]   And so, I think it's a very good thing
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.960]   to do with the internet.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.800]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.440]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.840]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.440]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.840]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.640]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.840]   And I think it's a very good thing to do with the internet.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.840]   Apple, here are the consequences.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.680]   This is a little bit like the drug ads you see on TV.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.440]   Side effects may include device and application instability,
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.280]   unreliable voice and data, disruption of services,
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.680]   compromise security, shorten battery life,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.960]   inability to apply future software updates,
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.760]   sausage fingers, if caution, if jailbreaking lasts
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.120]   more than four hours.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.640]   It's all the doctor.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.240]   Flu-like symptoms.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.800]   Now, Apple's pretty clear that they don't want you to do it,
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.160]   but they just don't have any legal way to stop you anymore.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.400]   Apple strongly cautions against installing any software that hacks the iOS.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.640]   And mostly this was targeted not at the users,
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.840]   but at the people who are distributing the software.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.960]   It basically takes a really big club just out of their bag
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.800]   and breaks it in half across the government's name.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.960]   So it's legal to not only jailbreak,
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.440]   but to write software that jail breaks?
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.120]   It can't-- the right exactly.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.560]   The opponent's utility.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.800]   Now there's really no way for Apple to prevent that
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.720]   from being distributed.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.480]   It's a legal piece of software.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.720]   Before they could say, we insisted you take this down
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.000]   because this is essentially a burglar tool.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.800]   That's not legal to distribute burglar tools.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.120]   Now the Copyright Office has said that,
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.280]   no, it's not a burglar tool, by all means,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.360]   distribute it all you want.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.600]   What I want to know, though, is that if it's now legal to sell that
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.760]   as a service, meaning if someone wants to have a lemonade stand
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   at the county fair saying, bring in your phone,
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.200]   we'll unlock it for you.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.000]   If that's OK.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.240]   Because if so, I'm sure that you could
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.040]   do a booming business saying that, send us your old iPhone.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.600]   We will do everything we need to do
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.120]   to make it workable on the T-Mobile network.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.320]   Not only will we unlock it, but we'll also
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.480]   make sure it's configured to use the 3G network.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.480]   We'll make sure it's configured to use voicemail.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.440]   Because once you've got the T-Mobile sim in there,
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.480]   you're about 85% there.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.920]   The rest of them are features that will not work
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.360]   unless you do a lot of really specific configuration.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:59.560]   Which is why I usually say, if you could jailbreak your phone
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.320]   and use the Verizon network on it,
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   that would be a really serious win, unlocking your phone
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.520]   and using it on the T-Mobile network.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.200]   That's just-- I mean, they're cheaper ways
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.960]   to flip the birded apple than once it will not result
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.360]   in reduced reduction of your 3G coverage.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.880]   Well, for me, the only thing I'm tempted to jailbreak a phone
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.520]   is just so I can get the video out.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.040]   Right.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:20.960]   You know, that--
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   I think it's mostly the case.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   When people jailbreak a phone, it's
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.040]   one or two particular applications on CDIA
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.640]   or somewhere that they want to run.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.520]   Or they want to stick it to the man.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.640]   EFF says it's about 1 million people.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.960]   They believe about 1 million people have
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.880]   jailbroken their iPhones.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.960]   That's less than 1%.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.800]   It's a small number.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.920]   Although Apple, I'm sure, is breathing a sigh of relief.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.080]   They don't have to prosecute Steve Wozniak
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:49.320]   for on television breaking Kathy Griffin's iPhone in a car.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.760]   Oh, that's not the first time her--
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.800]   OK, I'm sorry.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   I need something to be broken.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   I'm going to drop it off.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.160]   That's the first time a founder of Apple
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.040]   said it hard.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.280]   Let's not even guess.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.400]   We shouldn't even guess.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.200]   We just don't know.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.040]   Apple faces a lawsuit over overheating iPads.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.320]   I don't usually do lawsuit news because nine times out of 10,
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:17.360]   these lawsuits are going after deep pockets for stupid reasons.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.920]   This one is so egregiously stupid.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.240]   I can't help but bring it up.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.160]   The complaint filed three days ago in federal court
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.600]   in Oakland seeks unspecified damages and class action
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.960]   or group status, claiming, quote, "The iPad does not
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.080]   live up to the reasonable customers' expectations
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.560]   created by Apple because it overheats so quickly
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.400]   under common weather conditions."
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:45.800]   If you leave it in the sun, it turns itself off.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.360]   And it's always hot enough to try anything.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.560]   What's the deal?
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.760]   I mean, this is one of the few devices in the world
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.160]   that doesn't actually get hot when you're using it.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   You have to leave it in the sun to get it hot enough.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.920]   And then it's just protecting itself.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.080]   Anyway, I just love these.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.000]   But usually we don't want to report on them.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.560]   It's like, I don't want to give these guys any ammunition.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.720]   But that was just so egregiously silly.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:17.840]   What do we do?
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.920]   Oh, I want to talk a little bit about--
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.000]   I'm going to make enemies again here--
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.080]   Apple's decision to put out videos on YouTube
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.240]   showing dropped bars on other companies' cell phones.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.440]   We'll do that in just a little bit before we do.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.400]   Because I got some feelings about this one.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.560]   But before we do, it sounds like Andy does, too.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.280]   I want to mention squarespace.com.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.840]   Squarespace is a great place to go to make your next website.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.640]   It makes it easy, but yet looks professional.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.280]   You know, often those two don't go hand-in-hand.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.800]   You go to the easy design website, building site,
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.960]   and it looks like everybody else's website, kind of junkie,
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.640]   not squarespace.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.160]   My goodness, if you just go to squarespace.com right now,
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.480]   click the link at the top that says examples.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.880]   And take a look at what people have been doing with squarespace.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.400]   You'll see that every squarespace site is unique,
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.600]   is beautiful, is powerful.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.240]   Squarespace is truly fantastic, used
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:18.000]   by some of the best companies and people
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.400]   in the world to do beautiful sites.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.120]   And it's easy.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   You don't need to be the designer to use squarespace.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.040]   Anybody can do it.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.760]   Just go to squarespace.com/macbreak right now

[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   on WordPress or Blogger or TypePad or Moveable Type.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.200]   Just import it right in, import it right out, too,
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.400]   if you want.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.160]   Beautiful photo galleries, incredible social integration
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.440]   with all the major sites automatically.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.040]   Easy to put widgets on your page that show your Twitter,
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.120]   your Facebook, your LinkedIn, your Flickr.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.040]   You get great stats.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.480]   Their VPS technology, their Java Virtual Server technology
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.920]   means you never run out of bandwidth.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.680]   Form building data collection, intuitive editing,
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.960]   great iPhone app, best app ever for blogging.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.080]   And the amazing sites that look fantastic.

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.280]   So Apple has, they released another one with the phone
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.360]   and I use the Droid X.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.520]   They've done one with the Aries.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.640]   The Aries, I think you can get those bars to drop
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.480]   by hold it a certain way.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   But I was watching the Apple Droid X video.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   And yeah, boy, it sure looked like those bars dropped.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.160]   The death grip.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.360]   And yet I can't get it to happen.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.160]   PC Magazine said they can't get it to happen.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.680]   Engadget said they can't get it to happen.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.640]   It seems like, well, okay, there's two grounds
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.600]   to be a little perturbed by this.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.160]   A grounds one is, is this really the way to respond?
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.000]   Here's PC Magazine's response video.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.120]   They're trying to get the bars to drop.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.880]   Is this the way to respond to the antenna issue?
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.800]   - Yeah, this is just silly.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.960]   This is like the end of Lenny Bruce's career
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.240]   where every single time he'd go on stage,
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.840]   he'd spend half of his time talking about
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.960]   how the government is trying to shut him down.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.760]   You know, it's like you've made your point.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.400]   I thought it was a good point when you took the stage like that.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.760]   Every time you keep trying to come up with these new videos,
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.280]   not only are you giving another spin to the controversy,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.680]   but you're also giving people more stuff to fight against.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.240]   I mean, I think I'm on record.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.880]   My track record establishes that I'm fairly pro-appled
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.520]   and I like, I tend to like their products,
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.320]   at least I'm not in for any extra grind against Apple.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.040]   And yet the first thing I did was,
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.920]   okay, well, I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.880]   And I wonder what he has to say about this.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.760]   And I happen to have a Android X.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.480]   So, okay, let's see how, nope, I can't get me to make the signal.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.760]   - I try every way I could not get it to go down.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   And it keeps, unfortunately, I got a little bit steamed about it.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.880]   My Android X review was still on the drawing board.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.840]   I felt like I kind of had to add like two sentences saying,
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.840]   and in response to Apple's video saying that the Android X
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.680]   has a signal problem, like, when I hold the Android X normally,
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.160]   I cannot get the signal to drop.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.520]   I'm like the iPhone 4, which without a case,
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.160]   I don't know what they're testing here.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.840]   - I think just a jelly donut.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.680]   I think you switched over to some sort of a fetish porn.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.000]   (laughing)
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.400]   - Oh, I'm so messy.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.280]   - You know, you've got a magazine decided to test everything
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.160]   with the death grip, including jelly donuts.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.320]   And by the way, the jelly all the--
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.640]   - The jelly donuts, it doesn't work.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.800]   But it is very hard to understand, A, why Apple's doing this,
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.360]   and B, how they got to happen, to be honest with you.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.040]   - I think someone got inside Apple's head.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040]   They just got to him.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.200]   - They found somebody with a really fleshy palm is what?
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.760]   - They, well, it does, it does.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.760]   I guess it shows a hypersensitivity on.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.440]   And believe me, as the king of hypersensitivity,
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.440]   I'm not accusing Apple of anything, but hypersensitivity.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.400]   And I know this happens.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.720]   But really, is this really the way to respond?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.280]   When somebody says you got a faulty product?
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280]   Well, so do they?
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.120]   - Well, the thing is, is that that's exactly
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.280]   what's happening here on this show,
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.640]   is it gives them, it's another news cycle.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.280]   So they've just brought this all back up.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.880]   - Exactly, I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.720]   - Yep.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.880]   - Right, we were ready to let it go.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.080]   We were ready, like we had set our piece,
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.120]   you had gotten your droid, and we were ready to move on
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.480]   and talk about Apple, other Apple products.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   And now we're talking about this again.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.160]   - I hear a lot from people saying,
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.880]   okay, enough about cell phones.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.360]   But you know what, don't tell me enough about cell phones.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.400]   Tell Apple enough about cell phones.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.400]   - I think it was actually quite devious,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.640]   'cause they knew that if they released this video,
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.120]   you'd talk about it on air again,
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.360]   and then people would keep saying,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.760]   "Mean and Asci, things about you live."
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.920]   That's what it's all about.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.800]   They're trying to get me. - Don't write it to the trap.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.600]   - I fell into the trap.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.560]   You know, it's kind of an interesting video on YouTube.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.040]   It's very well done, but there's no narration at all.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.180]   It's just a picture.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.680]   And it's almost like, you see, it speaks for itself.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.520]   And it's just, it seems childish somehow.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.140]   - If you hold it this way, and then use the Photoshop
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.400]   clone stamp tool to clone over part of the blank screen
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.200]   to the left of the bars,
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.400]   you can easily get it to drop to zero in the picture.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.880]   - They're gonna get Robert Rodriguez
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.400]   to direct the next Deathcrip videos.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.200]   - Deathcrip, the video.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.280]   - The only thing that I can guess,
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.960]   and it is just a guess, because I have to agree with Alex,
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.760]   that every time you bring something like this up,
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:05.400]   you make people aware of it again.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.400]   You freshen people's awareness of it,
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.960]   and certainly if you want something to go away,
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.720]   that's not how you do it.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.840]   The only thing that I can guess is that maybe they're doing this,
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.120]   I was gonna say prophylactically or preemptively,
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.800]   just in case somebody gets it in their head
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.600]   to bring some sort of legal action to say,
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.160]   yes, this thing was defective and you knew it.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   - Oh, yeah, maybe.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.680]   - And instead, they can come back and say,
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.080]   well, okay, here is every phone in this generation,
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.920]   including the latest from another manufacturer,
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.800]   and they are all subject to the same problem.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.680]   But that's just a guess.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.440]   I agree with without actually being in the room
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.280]   where the decision was made, I can't speculate.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:00.040]   I can't say with any authority why that would have been.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.200]   - But Rich, remember that time that you had that release
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.040]   of "Mell Smith" that exploded and killed those seven kids?
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.920]   At some point, you decided, you know what?
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.840]   I'm not gonna play the press game anymore.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.880]   At this point, we fixed it.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.920]   You know, it doesn't do that anymore.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.000]   - Much.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.680]   - They probably shouldn't soak that manual
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.320]   in jelly gasoline instead of on fire,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.160]   but hey, we're not gonna be played judgment game.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.720]   At some point, you have to let the news item die.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.040]   - Listen, I have been in favor of seat belts
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.920]   on school buses forever.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.760]   - Yes.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.080]   - Exactly, and I don't think that people covered
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.000]   that part of the story.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.400]   It was, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.240]   This link from somebody in our chat room
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.400]   suspiciously named Fartsky.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.400]   Apple to deliver cut price computers to Taiwan after error.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.000]   US computer giant Apple agreed on Tuesday
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.480]   to deliver computers to customers at massive discounts
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.000]   after mistakenly offering them at bargain prices.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.440]   Friday, the company discounted a desktop computer
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.440]   and a server on the Education Apple stores a Taiwan website
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.680]   for about 40% off.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.160]   People caught on 41,000 units were ordered
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.820]   by these bargain hunters.
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.520]   The Mac mini was listed at,
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.400]   19,999 Taiwan dollars.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.280]   I don't know what that is in the US American currency,
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.480]   but there's about almost half what it would have been.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.080]   The eight gigabyte Mac mini snow leopard server,
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.020]   priced lower than the four gigabyte.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.840]   And Apple, Dell when this happened last year said no,
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.120]   and it's still being sued by many consumers.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.040]   Apple just said, all right,
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.280]   and may have lost as much as $40 million
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.040]   in the ensuing aftermath.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.280]   That's a lot of money to lose over a web error.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   We've seen that happen before.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.320]   In fact, we talked to Tony Shea,
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.280]   who is the CEO of Zappos.com.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.360]   His one of his high-end sites did something similar
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.560]   and lost millions in a few hours, and they honored it.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.600]   I think it's the right thing to do as costly as it is.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.600]   - Well, in some venues, it's the law.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.680]   I mean, we've probably all seen in the Sunday newspaper
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.720]   circulars, the fine print where it says,
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.040]   not responsible for typographical errors,
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.280]   and there's a reason for that.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.200]   - That's right.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.480]   - But it would not at all surprise me to learn
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.960]   that in places like Taiwan, if you make a mistake,
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.040]   you're on the hook for him.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.760]   And frankly, I'm gonna really be thrilled
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.360]   when those 12-core Mac pros are on sale for $500,
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.200]   'cause--
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.040]   (laughing)
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.840]   - I'm buying five, giving them to my friends for Christmas.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.080]   - Exactly.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.760]   - Time for our picks of the week.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.280]   Now, Rich, I didn't warn you, we brought you in
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.320]   in such a last minute that I didn't give you a heads up
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.560]   on this one, but I'll let you think about it
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.640]   for a little bit, your favorite bit of Mac hardware
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.520]   or software you'd like to recommend.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.040]   Of course, you don't have to recommend anything
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.800]   from bare bones, 'cause we know it's the greatest
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   for Jimbo and BB Edit, our must haves,
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.840]   text Wrangler, the free one, just must haves.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   - Is there any, you don't do mail smith anymore,
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.760]   or I think you sold it.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.320]   - That's correct, a while back, we did the,
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.000]   we the company, bare bones discontinued mail smith,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.760]   and actually structured the licensing
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.600]   so that I am continuing to work on it
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   as kind of an extra product and keeping the code alive,
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.280]   which is about the only way it could happen.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.760]   There was code in there that couldn't be,
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.800]   oh, but yeah, there's still a lot of proprietary tech in there,
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.880]   so we didn't want the product to just go away
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.040]   and leave its users dangling, so this is what worked out.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.240]   But yeah, no, not for a pick of the week,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.040]   I wouldn't recommend any of my own stuff.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.000]   - Well, think about something and you can pick it
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.720]   in just a little bit, but right now I'm gonna start
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.680]   with Alex Lindsey, who is in the third world capital,
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.640]   Los Angeles, where he can barely scrape together
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.960]   a cup of bandwidths.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.920]   - And while you guys were talking,
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.840]   the phone dropped off, and I had to go back and go,
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.160]   "Oh my God."
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.240]   - Wait, are you an AT&T customer else?
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.320]   - Yes, yes, I held the phone the wrong way,
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320]   and I, you know, so--
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.360]   - At least your test stuff.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.280]   - So my recommendation, I just got this great little stand
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.720]   for, it was actually sent to me for my iPad,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.120]   and it's called the Element Case, have you guys seen this?
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.880]   It's called the Dual, and here's the thing,
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.160]   it's a great travel stand for your iPad.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.280]   Now I have to admit, I actually like the Apple Case,
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.800]   you know, that I use, but a lot of times I want something
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.880]   a little bit more with a little bit more beef,
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.040]   you know, that's really gonna hold it,
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.800]   and so they sent me this case, and what it is
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.200]   is basically a little bar, it's like a circular bar,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.960]   and it's got three little holes in it,
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.920]   that you can just pop the little, another,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.760]   basically like another piece of metal into,
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.120]   that will let it stand at three different heights,
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.360]   and it turns out they're great heights,
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.000]   so you can change it, but it's very mechanical,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.160]   it's very sturdy, and it packs into almost nothing.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.400]   So as far as putting it in my bag when I'm traveling,
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.480]   and I was concerned, if you look at it on the website,
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.240]   you'll see that it looks like a weapon.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.160]   - It's heavy, anodized metal, I mean it's aluminum, yeah.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.520]   - This is like really high quality,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.560]   and I was like, I'm not sure, so I literally took it
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.720]   on the plane, just to make sure that no one was gonna give me
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.440]   any problems about taking it on the plane,
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.480]   'cause I was not sure that, you know,
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.360]   it was in the real possibility to believe that someone
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.920]   could hijack a plane with this thing, and--
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.920]   - Don't say that out loud, dude.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.520]   - Yeah, exactly, so I probably, maybe I ruined it
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.080]   for everyone, right for that comment, but no, no,
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.840]   it's just a really, it's heavy duty, it feels solid,
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.400]   and when you open it up and you set it,
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.360]   if you're on a plane and you wanna set it down on your tray
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.720]   to watch a movie or to work, you can set it up
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.360]   in different angles, and by taking away,
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.800]   just really well designed, by taking away the,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.600]   the kind of pushing it back and forth,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.920]   it's super simple, it's not gonna break down,
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.720]   it's got the rubber in the soft areas,
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.440]   right where you want it to be, and it really holds it,
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.560]   and it will hold, even with the Apple case,
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.680]   the iPad in the Apple case, you can still pop it in there.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.520]   - Oh, okay.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.960]   - So it'll do both, it obviously doesn't fit quite as
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.240]   comfortably, when you take it out of the case,
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.320]   it fits perfectly.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:29.040]   - Jewel is spelled J-O-U-L-E like the unit of energy,
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.840]   - And it is from elementcase.com.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.200]   - Yeah, and it's a great little travel case,
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.320]   if you're looking for something really sturdy,
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.240]   that you wanna be able to put back in your bag
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.800]   and have it not take up a lot of space.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.520]   - 129 bucks, I'm sorry, 129 for the,
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.120]   the regular one, the black or anodized silver is 139.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.560]   - Yeah, it's a little high end on the price,
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.720]   you know, I think that it was a little pricey,
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.800]   but it definitely, you know, it's solidly made,
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.520]   and I guess it's made, for those who are sensitive,
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.120]   I believe it's all made in the US,
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.600]   so it's all made locally.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.640]   - Yeah, very cool, thank you, Alex.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.920]   - There's shiny bits of metal,
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.480]   and really who can put a price on that?
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.080]   - Absolutely, says Rich The Watch Fanatic.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.440]   - Yeah.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.000]   - Alex, thank you for your pick, it's Andy Inako's turn.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.960]   - My pick is an app that made a lot of buzz last week.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:27.200]   It's a new kind of magazine for the iPads
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.080]   called Flipboard.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.320]   - Oh, I love it, yep.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.720]   - And I became an addict, like,
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.440]   I went through the usual like phases
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.080]   of tying out new software, where it's like,
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.360]   oh my God, this is most incredible,
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.920]   I was like, okay, calm down,
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.560]   start evaluating it objectively.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.680]   Oh, it doesn't do this.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.520]   Oh, it doesn't do that.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.880]   Oh, why doesn't it do that?
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.280]   Then, oh, wait, it does do that.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.560]   I just said, okay, there is a way, okay, got it,
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.120]   I've got it, got it, got it.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.480]   It's a wonderful app, because what it is,
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.800]   you know that the iPad's gonna be a great app,
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.760]   a great system for reading news,
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.680]   and reading blogs, and reading online magazines.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.400]   And for now, it seems as though the various folks
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.880]   that come up with only two very, very simple solutions,
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.160]   which is, they will either package together
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.000]   like a special digital version of Time magazine,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.840]   or as usual, you can just subscribe to RSS feeds
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.280]   in NetNewswire or something like that.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.880]   What this app does is, it ties into your Twitter feed
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.680]   and your Facebook feed.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.960]   And what it will then do is,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.480]   now this is just a Twitter group
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.560]   that I've just set up here.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.400]   What it does is, it realizes that
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.880]   what your Twitter feed and your Facebook feed do is,
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.960]   it's all your friends who give you links to things
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.120]   that they think that you might be interested in.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.000]   So what the app does is, it simply looks through
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.880]   your Twitter subscriptions and your Facebook subscriptions,
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.720]   and it looks for articles and pictures
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.840]   that have been linked to via people's, your friends' tweets.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.040]   And it does something really incredible.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.440]   It just puts it together into this very, very beautiful
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.040]   presentation, just like this.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.160]   And it will build out all this content
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.440]   by sometimes it will go through a combination
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.920]   of checking out the RSS feed that's,
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.280]   it will visit the page is actually being linked to.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.320]   And we'll use that to pull out a couple of paragraphs
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.560]   to build a very preview.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.600]   And if the article is actually something
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.680]   you're interested in, and you can even look at the comments
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.240]   that people have been leaving about it on Twitter
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.440]   in that conversation stream, once you actually
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   want to read it though, you've clicked on this read
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.480]   on the web, and then it will open the actual web page.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.680]   So you have an opportunity to look at the original web page,
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.880]   the full article with all the ads and all the other content
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.360]   that the website creator put together.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.800]   And it really is wonderful because not only
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.200]   is it for your own feeds, but this is something
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.440]   I didn't understand at the very beginning,
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.680]   the top page is all kinds of different channels
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.640]   you can set up.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.040]   And anything that can be described on Twitter
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:57.800]   can be a channel.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.080]   So if you want to have an iPad edition of the onion,
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.760]   all you have to do is set up a brand new section that simply
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.000]   says that is simply linked to the onion's Twitter feed.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.680]   And every single link that the onion posts, which
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.160]   is all of their articles, will be assembled into a very,
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.760]   very pretty magazine.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.320]   When you find-- it'll also work with--
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.800]   this thing is something I call the Mojo Wire, where
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.840]   I just put together a Twitter list of just
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.000]   all these different publications that
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.960]   do all kinds of really interesting and really, really
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.720]   cool things to link to.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.800]   So it's a kind of an aggregation of all
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.840]   of my favorite kinds of content, not just one source,
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.640]   but about two dozen different sources.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.120]   And so you can do that to develop your own sections
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.280]   of the content.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   And it really has turned into the way, sort of the default way,
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.000]   that I pick up and I sort of casually read news
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.280]   and read blog posts.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.840]   I still have my RSS reader for your really immersive.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.880]   I want to take a look at every single thing that's
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.120]   been posted, on all of my most important blogs,
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.280]   on all my most important news sources.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.640]   But when it comes down to, I'm just--
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.000]   I'm having my breakfast.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.160]   I want to read for about a good half hour to an hour.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.480]   It's definitely flip book.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.880]   It's become the fulcrum of that experience for me.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.760]   I mean, I'm writing my review for the Sun Times.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.000]   And as I was doing it yesterday, I
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.400]   wish I could put a stopwatch on the progress bar of this review
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.240]   because there'll be a paragraph where
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.440]   I'm writing about linking to specific Twitter groups.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.280]   So I want to say, oh, if you just type in the Twitter
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.240]   account for the onion, and I don't know,
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.120]   is it the onion or is it onion.com?
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.320]   So I'll open up Flipbook.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.760]   But then it's recently been updated.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.040]   And now they're like 40 new articles that I want to read.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:38.680]   And so I'm gone.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.720]   Who never gets an ARRAN?
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.840]   It really is uncanny at finding the article.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.960]   It's such a simple idea.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.000]   But the fact that it's mostly based on articles
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.800]   that friends and people that you know and trust
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.000]   are recommending, it is uncanny at putting together
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   a very, very pretty magazine of content
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.680]   you're actually interested in.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.400]   And because it does such a good job
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.640]   of assembling these content summaries--
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.200]   again, sometimes from the original sources--
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.360]   it is very, very easy to-- it's much easier
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.520]   to look at these 12 or 13 pages in this magazine
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.560]   and decide what you're interested in than it is
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.000]   to look at an RSS feed and say, well, here's a headline.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:15.640]   Here's a headline.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.280]   Here's a headline.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.320]   I have no idea what is linked to from this.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.120]   But I don't know.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   Maybe I'll take a guess and I'll tap on it anyway.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:22.800]   It's beautiful.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.080]   There is some question about the issue of scraping,
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.560]   because that's essentially what it's doing.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.960]   And in some cases, it's scraping more than the RSS feed
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   would give you.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.520]   And so it's making ads out.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.600]   And so I wonder what's going to happen in the long run.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.800]   Dave Weiner, who created RSS, suggested
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.360]   that instead of suing or litigating over this,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.080]   people should just create a way of signaling,
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.440]   here's how I want flip book to display my content.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.160]   The example that's given is the big photo, the Boston Globe,
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.320]   big photo, where they actually are giving you
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.680]   the full quality photo without a visit to the big photo site.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.120]   Well, I talked to the flip book people about it.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.960]   And for one thing, they do honor robots.txt.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.440]   So if you don't want flip book to get access to your content,
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.200]   just add that line to robots.txt.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.240]   It's a very simple mechanism.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240]   Also, there's the--
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.920]   and also, every time that you transact from the application,
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.160]   it's actually transacting through flipbook.com servers.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.480]   So if 1,000 users are--
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.200]   You're silos in here.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.640]   Andy, if you can just undo that or whatever it is.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   Whatever I did.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   OK, hear me now?
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   It's good.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:37.680]   Sorry.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.120]   So you're saying it's pulling from their servers not from--
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.440]   But it does is that the first time that someone asks
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.000]   for content that it doesn't have, it
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.520]   will get it directly from the source.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.840]   So that's a case where it's scraping content.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.120]   Subsequent fetches, it's not able to get it
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.080]   from a cached copy that is already on a flip book server.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.000]   So it's not necessarily a one-to-one correlation
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   between serving content from the source and serving content
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.120]   to flipbook.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.400]   Well, but that could even be worse,
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.560]   because if I'm counting impressions,
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.120]   and you're stealing impressions from me by caching my content,
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.240]   that could be bigger.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.640]   But you're not going to--
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.680]   Really, the big picture situation
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.400]   was the only situation you can really come up with
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.600]   where it is actually taking the end content
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.760]   from the original site.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.480]   Every other circumstance is only taking enough content
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.600]   to create that content preview, the first couple
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.560]   of paragraphs.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.640]   So if you really want to read the article,
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.800]   then you're still going to have to tap the read on the web.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.840]   And that will take you, again, directly
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.880]   to the actual web page, not to a reconformed version of it,
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.880]   but the actual web page.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.380]   Right.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.000]   With ads and everything else.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.680]   They're not caching the actual web page.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.480]   That's not-- they're not caching the actual web page.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   Again, all their caching is the content preview
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.520]   that they're assembling.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.360]   And they also-- they're also telling me
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.600]   that it's not just to be jerks about it.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.680]   There are oftentimes when they really can't--
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.760]   if someone is linking a New Yorker article from four years
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.640]   ago, it's still up on the server,
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.800]   but it's not inside the New Yorker RSS feed.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   So it has to visit the original content
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.920]   in order to build that content summary.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.440]   My opinion, as a guy who has a blog
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.400]   and wants people to read it, is that an app like Flipboard
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.720]   helps people to find my content and read my content.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.840]   And the fact that it helps them to read my content
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.520]   on my original web page if I ever
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.920]   decided that I wanted to place ads on my site,
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.680]   that's perfectly OK with me.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.760]   Right.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.440]   We talked a little bit about on Twitter,
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.920]   and I know they're going to talk about it this week
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.640]   on This Week in Lots.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.280]   And there's a little bit of controversy associated with it.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.920]   But as an end user, it is gorgeous and absolutely
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.960]   having on my iPad.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.400]   And I finally got allowed to sign into my Twitter account
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   today.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.240]   That's a problem because it is a free application,
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.160]   but since it does interact with Flipboard.com servers,
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.440]   and it got so much press, like in the first couple of days,
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.680]   that everybody tried to sign up their Twitter accounts
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.440]   and their Facebook accounts with it.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.840]   They tell me that establishing a new account--
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.080]   excuse me-- setting it up, configuring it
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.880]   for your personal Twitter and your personal Facebook,
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.920]   that is a very, very expensive transaction for its servers.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.360]   And so for that reason, that's why they're
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.440]   having a little bit of a meltdown.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.720]   That's why they went to the invite-in prospect.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.600]   They're telling me that once people are signed up
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.400]   and once they sort of get that super flush effect all
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.040]   disposed with, then they'll be able to serve pages
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.920]   and serve content previews like this without having
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.440]   a fail-well situation on their hands.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.520]   Very interesting.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:31.960]   It's great.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.280]   I mean, it's exactly the sort of iPad.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.680]   I really think that this is an app that will help sell iPads
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:38.880]   because it really has become almost my default.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.680]   If someone has not seen an iPad before,
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.400]   they want to know why it's so great.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.160]   I'm now showing the Flipboard because this is exactly the sort
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.480]   of thing that could not have existed before the iPad.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.640]   And I really think it should be a new direction
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.200]   and how news magazines are assembled and disseminated.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.720]   Flipbook free on the iPad.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.360]   All right, we've given you enough time, Rich, to think.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.520]   Well, my pick of the week is these.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520]   What are those?
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.480]   That's what Bruno's been eating this whole time.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.480]   Plastic beads on quarter-inch cotton
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:15.160]   rope capable of keeping African-grade pairs entertained
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.120]   for as much as three minutes at a time.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.640]   He loves that.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.880]   There are actually a couple of little things
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.520]   that I would pick on this week.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.480]   They're not necessarily new, and I don't know what your criteria
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:28.760]   are.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.640]   Do they have to be--
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.320]   No, absolutely not.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.400]   In fact, we're just interested in what you use or like or--
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.280]   OK, we'll build a little bit of enough, then.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.840]   Here's a couple of little things.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.800]   The first is that lacrosse battery charger that I mentioned.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.400]   Yes.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.680]   I live with it.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.800]   I love it.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.680]   It's made itself indispensable.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:50.080]   And by no means is this to say anything bad about the Apple
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.000]   charger, which I'm sure is a fine product.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.320]   It simply reminded me of how happy I am with the lacrosse.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:02.520]   It's the BC9,009, and you can find it on places like Amazon.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.920]   Well, you have the 9,009.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.120]   So you only have the BC700.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.400]   That makes me leave.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.000]   You're very--
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.480]   the Giz-- it was a pick on our--
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.200]   Giz was a show a few months ago, because they had a deal
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.640]   where you'd get the charger and a bunch of other things.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.680]   I mean, it was like a big package of stuff all at once.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.240]   So--
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.360]   Yeah, this is-- I use it.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:24.880]   I love it.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.360]   I concur.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.640]   And the other thing, which is a little more recent for me,
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.280]   is the Seagate Momentus XT.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.200]   It's a 2 and 1/2 inch laptop-sized hard drive.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:42.240]   But what's interesting about it is that it's got 500 gig
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:48.840]   or up to 500 gigabroting storage paired with 4 gig of flash.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.640]   So it's a hybrid hard drive.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.680]   It's rotating storage, and they use the flash to speed up
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.640]   access to stuff that's hot.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.320]   And because it's static, of course, the cache
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.800]   doesn't go away when you power the drive down.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.600]   And I upgraded my old MacBook Pro with this drive
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.240]   a couple of weeks ago, and it's just been,
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.520]   apart from the space-- the space expansion,
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.320]   it's been noticeably quicker.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.560]   And it's also surprisingly reasonably priced.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.520]   It's about twice the cost of the same drive
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.440]   without the flash.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.000]   So it's a little bit expensive per gigabyte.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.960]   But compared to how much 512 gig SSDs cost.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.480]   That's a really good idea.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.840]   So they give you a little bit of the best of both worlds.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.840]   A little bit.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.200]   It's really kind of right in the middle there.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.960]   And it's solidly on the price performance curve,
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.960]   on the affordable end of the price performance curve.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.520]   Very cool.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.320]   Seagate Momentus XT.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.240]   It's momentous.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.000]   And you're not going to do it, but I'm
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.240]   going to give you the plug.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.200]   barebones.com, Yojimbo 2 is a fantastic--
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.040]   what do you call it?
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:05.160]   Storage chest, I guess, for all the little bits and pieces
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160]   on your system.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.200]   It's kind of a scrapbook, notebook, kind of a program.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.720]   But it's just fantastic.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.520]   Both of these you can try for free.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   Right, you have a free trials on both BB Ed.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.000]   We do 30 demos.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.880]   And actually, we just did a BB Ed update this morning.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.960]   So if you've got BB Ed at 9, you can run out
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.520]   and grab that update.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.720]   Everybody loves BB Ed.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.440]   I think as Apple still does their website in BB Ed.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.800]   When the Apple Store goes down, you
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.640]   know they're firing up the BB Ed.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.280]   I was going to say, when the Apple Store goes down,
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.200]   it's my fault.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.120]   No, no, no.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.360]   It's still hand-code.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.000]   They're sighted, at least as far as I know,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.400]   unless they've changed that recently.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.800]   I think it's a blend of things.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.200]   I think there's a combination of hand-coding and dynamically
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.800]   generated content.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.920]   I'm sure they're using the web stuff that they do.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:56.320]   Yeah, but I know they love BB Ed over there in Cupertino,
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.520]   as we all do.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.280]   My pick is a program that went on sale at midnight today.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.560]   And if you're not in South Korea,
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.520]   you may not have it yet.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.240]   Everybody in South Korea already has it.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.480]   I am told the National Sport of South Korea--
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.680]   I'm talking about "Starcraft 2" and it's really nice.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.360]   One of the things I like about Blizzard
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.880]   is for many of their games now, when
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.840]   they do releases for big games like World of Warcraft,
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.400]   they release it for simultaneously 4 Mac and PC.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.800]   And we really appreciate that.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800]   And they deserve some credit for doing that.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.160]   I've been playing since the beta came out of "Starcraft 2."
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.920]   Actually, I only played for a couple of days.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.480]   And then I got my ass kicked so badly
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.720]   by these Koreans and 12-year-olds who
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.640]   have just an amazing click per minute speed.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.720]   But if you guys-- if you old guys want to play with me,
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.440]   I'll play with you.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.400]   I love "Starcraft."
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.760]   Do you know when "Starcraft" came out?
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.080]   It was 1998.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:57.760]   This is a 12-year-old game finally getting its sequel.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.880]   And it is awesome if you're a "Starcraft" fan.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.360]   Nuclear launch has been detected when on sale today,
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.240]   simultaneously on Mac and Windows.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.800]   Thank you, Blizzard, for doing that.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.120]   And you can get the digital download,
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.520]   so you don't have to go to the store and wait in line.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.360]   Got to have a single, handedly destroying
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:20.040]   the productivity of Western civilization since 2003.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.600]   Blizzard's amazing.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.360]   It really are.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.600]   I have to admit, I went to my iPhone
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.240]   and deleted all the games.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.280]   I was going to come out.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.120]   Yeah, I got it.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.640]   I got cold turkey.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.920]   Cold turkey.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:36.040]   I got a new iPhone game that I really like.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.440]   It's called "Hellsings Revenge."
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.640]   You're doing these potions, and the vampires
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.680]   is like a puzzle game.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.280]   Van Helsings revenge, something like that.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.040]   I really enjoy it.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.240]   But I won't tell you about that, Alex, because--
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.320]   No, I want to know.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.720]   --just suck you in.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.240]   Alex hates fun.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.160]   He hates fun, that Alex.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.440]   Rich Segal, so glad you could come in and touch a short nose.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.000]   And Bruno, we thank you both for being here.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.480]   Well, thank you for having me.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.840]   And my friend here.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.800]   Rich is probably the best-known programmer
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.080]   in the world of Macintosh.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080]   She's been doing it for how many years?
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.440]   Oh, god.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:12.080]   20--
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.240]   Wow.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:13.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.680]   One of those three--
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.680]   Ever since--
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.200]   Ever since--
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.360]   More Masters.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:17.720]   Ever since--
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:18.320]   More Masters.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:18.840]   More Masters.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.360]   More Masters.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:19.880]   More Masters.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.120]   More Masters.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.160]   OK, so how sad is it that I was able to read and understand
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.440]   the MacPaint code?
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:29.600]   That's exactly what I was going to--
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.240]   We used to write code that way.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:31.760]   Exactly.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.280]   More Masters.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.280]   More Masters.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.840]   You know.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:35.880]   And the event loop.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.000]   And the main is at the bottom of the page.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.320]   It was so funny.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.640]   Did you enjoy reading that MacPaint?
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.240]   That was a blast from the past.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.080]   It was great to read.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.240]   And it sort of drives home the point
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:52.520]   that that sort of elegant engineering really is timeless.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:53.840]   No kidding.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.760]   No kidding.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.000]   It's inspirational to see the work of really smart people
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.720]   and how good and relevant it still is.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:02.920]   Did you go through it line by line?
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.440]   I just kind of skim around.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.320]   I kind of read my way through it.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.800]   I didn't crawl through it line by line,
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:14.960]   but I did take a fairly leisurely stroll through it.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.400]   It was just a blast from the past.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.480]   And to look at the assembly code jumping into traps and things.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.320]   It's just nice to walk around the old neighborhood.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.160]   It really was.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.680]   It's like, oh, I remember having to type more Masters
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.560]   five times.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.200]   Because you didn't want to put it in a loop,
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.640]   man, that generated more code.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.280]   Exactly.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.640]   Pretty amazing.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.320]   Pretty amazing.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.600]   Well, thank you, Rich, for joining us.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.560]   It's really great to see you.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.600]   Bearbones.com.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.320]   Andy, you're not--
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.400]   I was just to see you as always.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.640]   Oh, it's great to have you on.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.400]   Are you going to any cruises in the near future?
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.200]   We can look free on.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:46.920]   I don't know.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.320]   I got off MacMeany of 10 this spring,
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.480]   but haven't really thought more about--
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.520]   Oh, you were on MacMeany of 10.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.320]   Oh, that's good.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320]   And that's good.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.280]   I'm going on 11 in the February.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.280]   I just found out that it's going to cost me three grand
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.800]   just for the Antarctica excursion.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.880]   Nice.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.640]   But you can't--
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.120]   But you know what?
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.000]   That's once in a lifetime.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.400]   You can't not go.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.640]   Exactly.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.640]   Yeah, it's costing me the same as a MacPro,
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.440]   but you can't not go.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.080]   Oh, well.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.400]   Andy Inaco is the man in the blue suit
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.680]   at the fabulous Chicago Sun Times.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.200]   He can also catch his website, www.cwob.com.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.800]   And he joins us every week to talk about Mac stuff
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.360]   from his beautiful home.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.880]   Exactly.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.240]   This is my crib.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.400]   I've got one teaky lantern and one railing.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.200]   And the rest is mostly just junk cars and old TV sets.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:42.120]   But I managed to get this part of it nice and tidy up
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.320]   just for my studio.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.480]   It's got the magic of television.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.000]   I like what you've done with the green screen,
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.160]   and it's really, really, really effective.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.920]   He actually lives somewhere where there are no windows.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:57.440]   You also have Hawaiian Beach and Star Trek Starfield.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.840]   Stop it for one, two, four, three.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.840]   The Kardashians are making trouble on the neutrals
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.880]   every again.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.000]   Pink it's so number two.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.160]   Alex Lindsey from somewhere just south of Botswana
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.080]   or something, I don't know.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.520]   You were actually in Los Angeles.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.920]   Yes, I've been in Los Angeles.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.520]   The place that evidently is bandwidth inhibited.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.320]   And hopefully someday they will be
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.200]   able to enter the 21st century.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.760]   But until then, I can still use the phone both at a time.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:25.200]   Yes.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.800]   If I hold it right.
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.720]   So you were on an iPhone for this?
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.480]   Brave of you.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.720]   Yeah, well, I have.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:33.920]   It's all I have.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:35.200]   They know.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.280]   I had to get the entire show.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.600]   I had to get one diggin.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.760]   That's all just one.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.600]   Oh, I own two iPhone 4s.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.160]   I'm not bringing them back.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.560]   I had to see you can make them fight.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.520]   [LAUGHING]
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.440]   And by the way, we will be streaming live on and off
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.040]   tomorrow.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.400]   So if people want to-- the best way to really do it
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.720]   is either go to pixacore.com tomorrow,
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.640]   or I will Twitter, or I will tweet out when we're about to go
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.640]   live on throughout the day.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:11.280]   So definitely, if you're not following me,
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.840]   you can follow me if you want to get those kind of updates.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.240]   And we'll go from there.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:17.720]   So pixacore.com, not.tv.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.400]   And you'll have some announcement on the front page.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:19.960]   Oh, there it is.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.160]   There's a live stream button right there.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:21.680]   OK.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.000]   So you go there and see what's going on.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.400]   And we've got the live view box.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.400]   And so we're going to wander around.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.280]   We're going to see there's a big party tomorrow night.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.840]   We're going to try to get in without causing too much trouble.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.760]   And see if we can show some people what the parties,
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.480]   and see if we can interview some cool people,
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   and so on and so forth.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.720]   Follow them on Twitter, pixacore on Twitter.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.200]   They'll tweet when they're going live.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.120]   And hey, speaking of live, we're going to do a live thing
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:43.720]   from Detroit.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.440]   We're going to be in the Motor City on Friday and Saturday.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.240]   Very excited about this.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.840]   Friday, we're going to be at the--
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.040]   that's July 30th.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.920]   We're going to be at the Rouge Plant.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.880]   We're going to get to see the assembly line floor.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.280]   And then we're going to head out to their virtual reality
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.680]   design area.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.920]   We're going to take a look at some of the amazing things
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.160]   that they use to design cars in the 21st century.
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.800]   It's just unbelievable the tech that they have.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.240]   So we'll stream that live.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.120]   We're going to start early now because we
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.080]   want to do it before this week in law.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.880]   So we'll probably be 8 to 11 AM Pacific time.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:23.280]   That's 11 to 2 Eastern time at live.twip.tv.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.720]   Friday, July 30th.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.280]   There's a meetup that evening, 7 to 10 PM
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.160]   at the Archimedes Lounge at the Hyatt Dearborn.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.440]   We already have 250 RSVPs, and the place only holds 200.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.720]   So what we'd like to do is if your last name begins with a letter
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.680]   A through G, if you could come in the first nom,
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.000]   just be prepared.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.160]   It might be a little cold.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.240]   It's a simple solution.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.360]   Just we'll just get a whole bunch of those lab coats.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.360]   And if some of you could sit on each other's shoulders,
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.000]   put on the lab coat, and we'll just
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.920]   have like an international federation of tall people
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.760]   confession.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.080]   It's a simple solution.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:56.920]   That's a well-handed--
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.600]   We just got to work together.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   Just want to swap off so people know no one's knees get
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.080]   buckled.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.240]   But we can work this out.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.880]   And then Saturday morning, 8 to 11 AM, July 31.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.400]   We'll be at the Maker Fair in Detroit
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.120]   at the Henry Ford Museum and streaming live from there
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:10.640]   as well.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.800]   It's just kind of a field trip, road trip.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.320]   But we'll be back next Tuesday live from the studio for Mac
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:17.840]   Break Weekly.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.200]   We do it every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.680]   1800 UTC at live.twit.tv.

[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.720]   Get back to work.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.080]   Break time's over.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:40.600]   OK.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.360]   Let's vech bet on mom.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.240]   We have adjustments.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.640]   We are knocking it off.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.400]   Knock it off.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.320]   Not those.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.560]   Oh, he says you've got something on your face.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   Oh, this is going to be a good run.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:50.920]   It is.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.720]   Break your pet to work.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.880]   It is.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.120]   What are you going to do?
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.400]   You should go to the door.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.400]   What is it?
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.920]   You keep the tag on his ear for identification.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.240]   If you should get lost, is that the--
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.520]   Well, you know, because I don't believe
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.800]   in one of those electric fences.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.200]   I give him the free brand of the neighborhood.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.600]   You know, it's just--
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.840]   He's been chipped.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:09.760]   Oh, he has been chipped.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.760]   OK.
