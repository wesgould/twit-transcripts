[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 102, and joining us.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.240]   A skeleton crew.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.080]   Merlin Mann is out giving speeches.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560]   Scott Bourne is just out of his mind, but fortunately,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.280]   Andy Inako is here.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.880]   Avaya EVDO.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.880]   Amazingly enough.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.920]   Yes, I'm using a topical preparation.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.760]   I'm told that there was a clear up in six to eight weeks.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.440]   Evdo, for those special times.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.920]   Also, Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcorg, Alex and I were in
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.800]   Vegas over the weekend and having a great time.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.560]   Yes, it was Vegas.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.240]   It's funny, I always look forward to going to Vegas.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.440]   And then I almost would equal fervor look forward to
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.560]   getting the hell out of Vegas.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800]   It goes hand in hand, doesn't it?
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.480]   Yeah, no, there's a couple things around Vegas that I
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.280]   think is kind of fun.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.800]   But--
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   Did you do your rifle range?
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.880]   Did you do shooting?
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.960]   You know, we almost had the ultimate shooting where Scott
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.400]   Simpson and Justine, Esurich, and Lisa Bettany and myself.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Wow.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.760]   You were going to go shooting.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920]   Wow.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.960]   I think we were all too tired.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.760]   By the time we got to Saturday, I had already done--
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.920]   I had been at Sea Graph before that.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.200]   And so it was my second conference in the same week.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.840]   And by literally by--
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.480]   I had to speak on Saturday morning.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   And when I was done, I just went to my--
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.440]   When did Boston, yeah.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.960]   I was done.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.800]   I was at Play Werewolf.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.240]   We were at New Media Expo and formally podcast Expo.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.720]   And I think--
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.840]   Great crowd.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.680]   I mean, it was fun.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.720]   Not a huge crowd.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.680]   Not a huge crowd, but the people there were really--
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   it was like the real committed folks that were really
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.000]   into it and enthusiastic.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.240]   Yeah, I quite enjoyed it.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.920]   I had a great time.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.800]   We covered it.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.600]   In fact, we've been doing reruns, and we'll continue to
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.120]   do reruns, or have a lot of great interviews.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.520]   Jonathan Colton performing.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.720]   Gijaf Smith performing.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   It was really really fun.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.920]   Amber Keene.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   We had that one moment when I had Amber, Justine, Lisa,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.280]   Molly Lynn, and Sarah Austin all on the podium
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.920]   at the same time.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   And I was just in middle-aged man heaven.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.040]   Yes, I once said, did you see what's going on over at Leo's?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.760]   Let's talk about Mac News.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.640]   There's a lot of Mac News.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.560]   I think one of the most interesting stories came out
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.000]   of Callie Lewis.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.920]   She interviewed a developer who says, I have a toolkit that
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.560]   will allow programs to implement cut and paste on the
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.120]   iPhone.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.040]   And now, if only people would start using it, we'd be able
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.400]   to see it.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.000]   I guess there is apparently a common area on the iPhone
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.960]   that applications can access.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.240]   So they're using that common area to do cut and paste.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.560]   But again, you can't add it yourself as an end user.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.760]   Zach White created this open source framework called Open
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.400]   Clip, and you'd have to include it in your app.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.760]   Apparently, it's compatible with Apple's SDK.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.440]   It doesn't violate any rules.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.360]   If someone can do this workaround, I just don't understand
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   why Apple just doesn't put in the cut and paste.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.200]   Well, that remember when we were discussing this a few weeks
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   ago about how hard it would be to implement, it sounds like
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.800]   it's not that hard.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.560]   I mean, someone's doing kind of a-- I mean, they've
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.240]   Jerry rigged it into a point where they can get it to work.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.920]   And I can't Apple.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.440]   I have to say.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.800]   Yeah, well, that's one of those things we have to really
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.440]   sort of wonder, do we know absolutely everything there is
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.960]   to know about the iPhone framework?
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.560]   Do we know absolutely everything there is to know about
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600]   how you can break the stamp thing?
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.400]   And could there be a good reason why Apple's saying, you
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   know what, cut and paste?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.760]   Not quite yet.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.720]   This is great news.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   I can think of so many ways that you'd want to use cut and
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.640]   paste on an iPhone.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.480]   But this is another case of I don't want the entire
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   industry to swarm around just this sort of hippie, crunchy,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.280]   granola standard that then becomes completely blown away
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.480]   once Apple decides they figured out the way they want to do it.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.280]   Or if there's a brand new iPhone, virus, or Trojan horse
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   that is named after this special plug-in for doing
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   cut and paste.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.080]   Right.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.480]   Well, he says this is only a stop gap until Apple comes up
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.120]   with some sort of approved way of doing it.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.640]   And I think that that might be one reason developers might
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.000]   just hold off.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   We keep hearing a little bit.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.920]   It seems like something that belongs in the OS.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.720]   It doesn't seem like something that developers will be
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.440]   having to put together or should put together.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.400]   I mean, it just--
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.880]   I mean, I just don't understand that I get--
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.080]   I mean, it just seems like it's a computer.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's a computer.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.840]   Well, I think that's really true.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.720]   This was my--
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.200]   we had this kind of discussion when iPhone 1 came out.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.680]   That I felt that it was--
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.080]   in fact, we had a debate, as I remember,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.200]   because I said it's a computer.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.880]   And it deserves third-party apps.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   It deserves Cut and Paste.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   It deserves to be an equal partner with other computers.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.160]   And people say, no, no, no, it's a phone.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.720]   But more and more, it's a computer.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   And yeah, Cut and Paste is kind of a requirement.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.400]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.920]   I mean, if we're going to consider the iPhone
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.480]   to be an ordinary computer, why don't we have a menu bar?
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.560]   And why don't we have a control key in the vertical key?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.080]   Well, oh, no, no.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.160]   You have to acknowledge that the UI is different on a touchpad.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.880]   You know, different on a small screen.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.640]   You don't want to use real estate for a menu bar.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.240]   I don't think of that.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.640]   Microsoft made that mistake with Windows Mobile.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.240]   What's wrong with Windows Mobile is it takes four clicks
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.480]   to do anything.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.800]   I like about the iPhone the fact that Apple really
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.840]   has thrown out the standard-- even the standard
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.600]   palm top interface and is trying to create something brand new.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.120]   I can't imagine what would be more natural or useful
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.880]   than Cut and Paste.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.200]   But the optimist in me hopes that maybe Apple
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.480]   has an idea about that.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.360]   We'll get something that says, you know what?
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.200]   Why do we have this new iPhone analog on the Mac?
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.000]   Why do we still have Cut and Paste on the Mac?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.120]   Why don't we have this thing that we have on iPhone?
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.280]   Are you mean something better than Cut and Paste?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.240]   Wouldn't it be great if we had something as good as what
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.320]   Bear Bones is doing?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.560]   Slice and glue.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   Well, slice and glue.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.000]   If we had-- oh, god, I can't remember.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.520]   I keep calling it by its beta name, Sidekick.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.400]   Ah!
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.480]   It's a really great archive, anything
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.640]   that I see in front of me or want to print or--
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.120]   Your Jimbo?
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.920]   --have in a window.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.360]   You used to be called Sidekick.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.680]   It didn't.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.440]   I didn't know that actually.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.320]   I love your Jimbo.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.080]   Although I've replaced it with Evernote
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.560]   because of the sync capabilities.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.560]   Anyway.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.480]   Something like that.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.200]   How about a Cut and Paste that-- imagine a world in which
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.120]   mobile me actually worked.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.600]   And the sky is filled with candy.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.640]   Women will come up and talk to me in bars.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.160]   That's the magic of a world like this.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.760]   But imagine mobile me being the holistic universal cut
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.440]   and paste repository.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.400]   That you cut something and it's simply
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.560]   saying it is now in the clipboard.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.520]   It simply says, this is the OS.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.120]   A technology is that this is something
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.920]   that for some reason you found useful or interesting.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.840]   And then instead of simply saying,
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.680]   I'm going to paste whatever's in the clipboard,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.200]   you can simply say, you know that useful piece of information
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.240]   that I just cut one second or one year ago?
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.920]   I want it right here right now.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.840]   And it was had a-- wow.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.320]   It gave you a really good natural way
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.160]   of pulling that back down out of the cloud
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   and putting it where you want it.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.800]   That's intriguing concept.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.160]   So you think that's what Apple's doing?
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.600]   Or I mean, I remember Greg Jazwiek said, oh, it's very low
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.200]   on our list.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.640]   Maybe that's disinformation.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.520]   Maybe it is just as simple as--
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.680]   somewhere in Cupertino, there is a glowing crater
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.080]   in the middle of a floor that's still glowing purple
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.840]   because that's where they tested out the copy and paste
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.320]   feature two years ago.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.200]   And they still-- whatever demon rose from the tile
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.280]   throughout the prototype minute, pulled it down,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.800]   has not brought it back yet.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.600]   It's just as simple as they can't get it working right.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.440]   But hopefully, so that they can top it with something
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.320]   better than cutting the base.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.640]   Yeah, you might be right, actually.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.160]   Maybe there was something--
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.960]   and we don't know.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.040]   I mean, we just take Zach White's word for it
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.920]   that this is all safe and sound and not an SDK file.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.000]   I am the god of hellfire.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.320]   You will not put a propeller key on the iPhone.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.560]   It will not paste.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.200]   It'll blend, but it will not paste.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.520]   Mobile me is still so screwed up that Apple's now giving
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   subscribers an additional 60 days,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   so we have three months free of mobile me.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.600]   I read that.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.360]   I was reminded of the famous quote from James Cameron,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.160]   the director.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.880]   Like, when you screw up on the set, you don't get fired.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.840]   He says, no, no.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.680]   If you screw up on my set, I keep you on for the rest of the film.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.000]   That's your punishment.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.880]   Why are you too PC?
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.880]   That's like your punishment for using mobile me as being
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.440]   sentenced to another 60 days.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.760]   You're like a repeat offender.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.200]   You have not learned you're less than yet.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.320]   Can't get out.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.160]   You can't get out.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.920]   To recognize our users' patience,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.200]   we're giving every mobile me subscriber.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   No.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.520]   To recognize that our users will put up with almost anything
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.440]   for any lifetime.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.200]   You get-- we're going to push them and push them
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.720]   and push them until this gun fire.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.600]   Second prize?
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.840]   Six months of mobile me.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.000]   This is an edition of the one month extension most
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.200]   subscribers have already received.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.840]   We're working very hard to make mobile me a great service
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.600]   we can all be proud of someday.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.040]   We all know mobile me--
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.080]   but OK, what's wrong with mobile me?
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.400]   Is it still broken?
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.480]   It's working for me.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.560]   All I use it for is sinking.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.280]   What's wrong with it?
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.080]   Is it still broken?
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.040]   I still can't get it to work up to its potential.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.760]   If you're just expecting a really good centralized
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.840]   sinking service, it really works well.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.960]   If you're just looking for a good Ajax-y webmail client,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   it works well.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.600]   But when you talk about the great features that were promised
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.800]   a month before the iPhone's release,
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.720]   if you're talking about the features that would put it
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.960]   on par with a BlackBerry's level of intimacy
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.720]   between an exchange server and that sort of thing,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.760]   I admit this is a little bit out of my personal experience
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.280]   level.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.600]   So this is when I get--
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.440]   I hire a couple of seeing iron nerds who do work on exchange
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.040]   server, stuff like that for a living.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.200]   And they keep telling me, well, no, it doesn't work like this.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.920]   And I can't handle this sort of bandwidth.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.880]   And the people who rely on this will want this to be at least
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.400]   an 8 and 1/2 or a 9 out of 10.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.320]   Right now, it's only a 7 out of 10.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.160]   Is it enterprise people who are unhappy?
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.800]   Pretty much.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.560]   It's the people who are trying to support 100 of these,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.160]   150 of these that keep telling--
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.600]   they keep giving me the ones that really got sort of knocked
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.760]   me a little bit back on my heels.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.360]   For people who want a cheap way of getting those kind of push
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.960]   services and those sync services, it's wonderful.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.160]   Again--
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.360]   It's working for me on the phone.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.560]   I'm getting my calendar.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   The calendar propagates.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.200]   I get my address book.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   It propagates.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.520]   I haven't had any of the duplication issues
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.720]   that you often get with syncing.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.800]   I mean, it's been clean for some weeks now.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.960]   I haven't tried uploading photos.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.560]   I disk still works.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.520]   I'm not sure what's missing.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.280]   I haven't-- I have been--
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   I don't push mine very hard, but I haven't had any trouble
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.360]   at all.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.920]   So I think it is something that sporadic is happening across.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.240]   And it depends on how hard you're pushing it.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.360]   I've been using it basically like Dot Mac
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.720]   when I first got it.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.040]   I haven't really grown that much into it.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.240]   So that might be part of the reason that it's the people who
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.040]   are pushing it a little harder that are expecting more
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.120]   that are really up against it.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.800]   So it's the exchange features, I guess.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.600]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.680]   I went to my expiration date.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.800]   It's now 90 days free.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.280]   That's great.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.400]   I go all the way up to January 6, 2009.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.640]   Well, if this keeps up, I mean, I
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.320]   mean, never be able to cancel.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   Maybe--
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.880]   a lot of people have said that mobile media should
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.360]   be a free service that Apple adds,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.200]   and it may just turn out to be a free service that Apple adds.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.280]   Yeah, but they're giving it 20 gigs of storage, which is a lot.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.560]   I mean, I think it's certainly--
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.280]   it's worth the $80 or $100 depending on where you buy it.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.400]   Well, I think so too.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.600]   And I think that--
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.480]   I do want to say that Apple's having a lot of trouble with it,
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.800]   but there are a lot of companies that
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.200]   would have trouble with this kind of stuff
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.320]   and not give away 60-day extensions
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.040]   at the cost of millions and millions and millions of dollars,
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.920]   given that not everyone's having the trouble
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.240]   that people are having.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.960]   So I mean, I think that I will give Apple props
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.640]   for kind of staying ahead of that issue.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.920]   Let's give them credit.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.320]   Let's also acknowledge that this helps
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.440]   to keep mobile media subscription-based numbers up,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.960]   whereas if people were not actually being extended,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.440]   these are people who would not be renewing
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.920]   at the end of their period.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.680]   Although, I do think that, again, I'm optimistic.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.320]   I think that they're just saying, you know what?
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.160]   Let's be nice.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.520]   Let's give them back the 30 days of usefulness
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.800]   that they lost in the first 30 days of this service.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.960]   Hey, before we get to our next story,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.200]   I do want to mention our sponsor, GoToMeeting.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.000]   And the reason they're-- what, you might say?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   What?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.600]   They're on a Mac?
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   What?
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.440]   They don't do Mac.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.040]   It's a Windows brought-- no.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.000]   GoToMeeting is now available for the Mac.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.640]   It's the easy online meeting service.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.000]   You can hold or attend meetings right now on your Mac
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.800]   and try it free for 30 days at gotoMeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.760]   Those of us who've been using GoToMeeting for some time
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.440]   really know how cool it is.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.040]   It's a great way.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.600]   Initially, I think people use it for sales presentations.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.000]   So you'd call your client and say, look,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.160]   I can't come to Muncie tonight.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.800]   Something's come up.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.520]   Gas prices are $8,000 again, whatever.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.960]   But tell you what, you don't want me to--
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.400]   look, let's just do this on the phone.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.160]   We'll do a conference call, but better yet,
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.680]   we'll do a conference call with GoToMeeting.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.520]   And you send him a link.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.680]   You send him the address.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.640]   He goes there.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.760]   All of a sudden, he's seeing your computer, your Mac,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.280]   or your PC on his screen, Mac, or PC.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.200]   It will cross-platform too.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.880]   You can use a PC.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.520]   You can use a Mac or vice versa.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   He can see your keynote presentations.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.760]   He can see documents.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.960]   You can work on documents together.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.640]   You can collaborate.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.720]   It even works for training.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.840]   So Alex, I know you could use this for, say,
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.880]   something like Pixelcore, DV Garage.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.720]   You've got the program.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.320]   And especially a lot more and more of our organizations,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.120]   not just ours, are global.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.600]   And it's not just a matter of it's a little bit more convenient.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   It ain't just one.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.680]   You have to find a way to get ahold of people
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.800]   and have an efficient meeting.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.280]   And right now, Skype is--
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.560]   or I, chat, or whatever, is one little step.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.920]   But you can do so much more with GoToMeeting.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.760]   This is the full--
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.720]   and it has VoIP built in.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.640]   And it's cross-platform.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.480]   I can go on and on.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.840]   Look, just go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak, 30-day trial,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.000]   unlimited use.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.120]   GoToMeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.240]   They wanted everybody in the Mac world to know
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.520]   that they've been working very hard to make it Mac compatible.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.440]   It is.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.240]   Now it is.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.400]   Yay, we can celebrate.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.360]   Give them a try anyway, just to thank them for--
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   show them that the Mac community cares.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.400]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.080]   We thank them so much for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.400]   All right, so let's look at some other rumors now.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.240]   This is the rumor portion of the program
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.800]   in which we tell you stuff that's absolutely fabulous and untrue.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:54.160]   From the unofficial Apple web log, people are saying now,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.640]   a tip shot into our mailbox this morning.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.280]   There you go.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.520]   That means it's true.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.320]   An iTunes unlimited by late September.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.400]   We're still waiting.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.440]   Apple really dropped the first shoe
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.400]   by saying something big end of September.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.920]   We're still waiting.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.600]   My bet would be a new MacBook Air,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.920]   perhaps based on these new Intel chips.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.480]   Probably not in the Halem, but a new Penrin with higher speed.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.080]   There are some rumors that it will have a large SSD Intel
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.880]   announced that they're going to do a 160 gig solid state
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.680]   drive, as well as an 80 gig solid state drive.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.640]   And given that Apple's relationship with Intel,
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.200]   it seems likely that whatever they announce
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.840]   will show up in the air.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.120]   They may announce an air with a 160 gig drive,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.240]   but that won't be available until 2009 from Intel.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.800]   What do you think?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.920]   Let's talk about these rumors.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.840]   Unlimited iTunes?
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.080]   You think that's in the works?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.880]   I think they have to address the--
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.920]   I think the paid music model is going towards subscription,
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.200]   not as a rule, but at least as an option.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.040]   When you consider that with Rhapsody,
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.840]   I've had these services before, and nothing can make me
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.320]   keep a Zoom in my pocket for more than the time
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.600]   it takes to review it.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.920]   But it was great to load it up, wasn't it?
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.960]   Exactly.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.000]   I had no idea that Billy Connolly, before he
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.640]   went into comedy, was a musician.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.320]   I certainly would not even waste 99 cents to find out
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   what a Billy Connolly major tune is.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.420]   Right.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:25.720]   But you know what?
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.440]   If you could download all three of his albums for free--
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:28.960]   Exactly.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.720]   --then essentially for free, yeah, you're going to do it.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.000]   And $10 a month, which is what most of these services
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.120]   actually cost, that's not a lot of money
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.480]   if you are really going to be an adventurous music person.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.560]   And in a world with Pandora, in a world with Last FM,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.240]   it just makes more and more sense.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.000]   And also, Apple is going to need a new tool
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.560]   to fight Amazon MP3, and this could very well be it.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.000]   I think this makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.560]   I haven't heard anything to confirm this,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.240]   but that does make a lot of sense for Apple.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.960]   How much would you charge for such a thing?
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.040]   If they could crack $10 a month, I think that that would work well.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.320]   Oh, that would be the price, yeah.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   If they were $100 a year--
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.920]   if they could break $100 a year, that'd be great.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   If it were even an add-on option to help further sell
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   lipods, that if an iPod touch cost $199 or $250
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.840]   with unlimited music for one year, that would really--
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.320]   that would change them from an 800-pound gorilla
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   to say 845-pound gorilla.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.720]   Well, I think the biggest problem that Apple will have
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.400]   is not going to be antitrust.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.080]   It's not going to be whether it works or not.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.680]   I mean, the thing is that they--
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.040]   because they have the system--
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.240]   what everyone else is having trouble with
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.320]   is everyone's got an iPod or a lot of people have iPods.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.400]   The people who pay for music a lot have iPods.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.360]   And the issue is that they're the ones
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.280]   that could make this work.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.120]   I think everybody else has had some degree of whatever
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.600]   they're doing, but that's because they've all
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.680]   came out largely after Apple did what it did.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   And so if Apple turns this on, I just think--
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   I think that there's--
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.080]   oh, we've talked about it in the show before.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.480]   I just think that, for instance, just the ability
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.040]   to virally spread things around.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.320]   If I can create mixes that people can no longer
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.280]   have to pay for, they can just download it.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.960]   I just think that there'll be a lot of people passing stuff
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.040]   around.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.200]   Another rumor.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.040]   Well, OK, let's talk about the MacBook Air rumor.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.200]   What do you think there?
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.000]   I'm actually literally so sure that there'll
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.520]   be a MacBook Air rev in September
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.400]   that I'm holding off because I really want to get one.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.520]   We were waiting for you to buy one.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   Well, wait till then we could say it was for sure.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.800]   Because I really think that there's going to--
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   I think that's what they're going to announce.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.640]   What are they going to announce?
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.200]   What's going to be the big announcement?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.840]   I think that the MacBook Pros are getting--
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   are getting along in the tooth.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.760]   You have the Pros, a new Pro, solid state drives in those,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.960]   Penrin, Nahalim.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.400]   I think that a new chipset probably
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.760]   would make a lot of sense.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.600]   I mean, I don't know about the solid--
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.400]   I have a 250 gig drive on my computer
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.360]   and I can't really imagine having anything smaller.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.840]   I can barely fit everything into that one.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.000]   So Intel Developers Forum is going on right now.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.080]   We're actually going to get a report later in the day
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.720]   from Will Harris, who's there at the moment.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.000]   But they're talking about this new mobile Nahalim, which
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.160]   would be basically quad core in a laptop.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:28.760]   That, I think, would be a reason to rev the Pros, don't you think?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.000]   Yeah, I mean, if that's available in mass, in the fall.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.080]   Also, they've got this turbo mode, which is very interesting.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.160]   It's quad core processor, but if it senses you're only
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.000]   using two of the cores, it shuts off the other two
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.320]   and overclocks the first two to give you better performance.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.080]   They call that turbo mode, integrated memory controller
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.320]   and graphics core into the CPU, which eliminates--
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.800]   That would handle all the graphics operation?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   I'm not very excited about that.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.760]   Yeah, well, for somebody like you, it wouldn't be good.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.520]   Yeah, it's great for people who aren't doing anything
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.800]   that requires graphics.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.160]   Well, they say it'll be better than motherboard video,
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.960]   but not as good as standalone GPUs.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.400]   Right, right.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.280]   So I hope that-- I mean, that's fine to do in the MacBook.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.600]   I just hope they don't start pushing that into the MacBook.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.120]   Quoting PC world here.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.040]   With between two and eight cores, the speed of Nahalim chips
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.960]   will be enhanced with the quick path internet--
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.800]   or I'm sorry, interconnect technology,
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.680]   which integrates a memory controller
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.280]   and provides a faster pipe for chips and system components
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.400]   to communicate.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.680]   Nahalim will support DDR3 memory,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.920]   include a shared 8 megabytes of L3 cache,
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.120]   each core will be able to execute two software threads
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.000]   simultaneously.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.200]   So a server with eight processor cores
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.560]   could do 16 threads simultaneously.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.120]   See, I mean, if you listen to all these descriptions,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.400]   this is not a September product announcement.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   It's a little too small.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.680]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.080]   I mean, for one thing, I mean, for the past two months,
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.240]   two or three months, it's my inbox, my PR inbox,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.960]   has been nothing but, hey, look at this great new laptop.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.440]   We got, hey, look at this new sub notebook.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.440]   We've got, hey, look at this new consumer notebook we have,
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.920]   because the time to put a new notebook on the market
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.560]   is before people start buying new notebooks
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.280]   to go back to college with and to go to high school with.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.760]   So you think Apple's late to the game?
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.840]   I don't think that that's, I don't think this is going to be
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.520]   yet.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.200]   If they're releasing this stuff in September,
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.800]   they have missed their biggest window of opportunity.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.240]   September in October is the time when
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.120]   you release new products that people are going to be buying
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.200]   for Christmas, buying for the holidays.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.320]   So when I, and also if you listen to the language of,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.120]   I mean, Apple's been a little bit cute about what they're
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   going to be doing in September.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.640]   Their language seems to indicate that they're
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.800]   going to be doing something different from what
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.680]   we've seen before.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.200]   And I don't see a high performance notebook
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.360]   fitting that mold.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.040]   I would not be surprised if, I mean, what you're saying
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.520]   is absolutely correct.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.640]   The notebooks need a refresh.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.320]   It needs a revenue.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.160]   It needs new processors.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.440]   It needs new something, something with lots of letters,
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.560]   numbers, and acronyms.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.920]   And benchmark tests, and only people
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.840]   with one pair of glasses with tape on them.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.440]   And a backup pair of eyeglasses with tape on them
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.240]   could really understand, explain, or appreciate.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.840]   But I also think that the MacBook Air is just screaming
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.640]   for a $999 model, a version that's
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.200]   where they figure out how they can build these cheap.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.240]   And so 10 times as many as they're doing right now.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.680]   Because it's a great success story,
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.320]   but it's still a style--
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.880]   what's marketed as a style notebook,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.120]   where it's understood that you're
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.280]   paying $500 for the way it looks and the way
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.080]   it fits in your hand.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.360]   So when it comes to September, I really only
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.840]   have two things that I'm sort of anticipating.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.240]   Number one, something cheap, something--
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.480]   in terms of notebooks, something cheap, something consumer,
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.760]   or something the more, maybe one of the most affordable Mac
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.040]   portables that has ever been released,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.840]   or category two, anything else.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.120]   Just something that would be totally new, totally different.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.000]   I still don't think it would be anything
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   along the lines of a tablet Mac or a tablet sized iPhone.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.760]   But it might very well be a brand new type of consumer
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.040]   product that, just like everything else that Apple
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.000]   introduces, complements the rest of the line very, very well,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.720]   and sort of underscores the strength of putting all your eggs
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.280]   in Apple's basket.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.200]   I'm just going to keep on predicting the tablet until I get one.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.000]   I think there's going to be an iPhone tablet.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.960]   It's twice the size, twice the height of the iPhone.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.880]   And it's just going to--
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.400]   I'm just going to keep--
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.760]   Well, that's the kind of product it would talk about.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.440]   A tablet mouse, the size of a kitchen scale.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.560]   No, I just--
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.520]   I can-- I imagine it.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.920]   I'm almost thinking of just building one carrying it around,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.600]   just to prepare my bag and get it all worn in
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.600]   so that I can have it and I can set it in there.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.680]   Now, you for a while thought about doing that unilaterally.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.480]   And I saw that TechCrunch is also planning on doing kind
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.880]   of what they call an open hardware production
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.600]   of a small tablet.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.560]   We were close.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.520]   And I have to admit that a lot of it just had to do with--
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.960]   we were so busy with other things.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.080]   We just weren't able to quite make the turn,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.160]   the hardware partner that we had established within Korea,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.520]   just didn't look like we were going
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.400]   to be able to turn that over.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.560]   We went through quite a lot of planning in the spring
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.120]   because we just thought that the time has come for that.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.320]   And there's so many things.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.360]   When you start thinking of a screen that's just a little bit
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.080]   bigger than an iPhone, there are so many things
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.000]   that you can do with it.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.440]   I think that's the real issue.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.400]   And then you suddenly, when you start really thinking about it--
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.000]   and the reality is that we don't want to--
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.840]   from my standpoint, I don't want to build the hardware.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.720]   I just want to build--
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.880]   I want to build content for it.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.760]   I think it's an exciting content platform.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.560]   But being able to have it sitting in your kitchen
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.160]   or propping it up somewhere and being able to actually watch
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.840]   stuff, the iPhone is great when you're
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.320]   sitting there in a personal space.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.640]   But if you're doing anything else, it's just too small.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.840]   I just can't think of any open hardware
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.200]   spec that has ever really played out.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.700]   I know.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.440]   It's a hard thing to do.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.320]   Well, Oppo Moko might, at some point, develop a phone.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.080]   Android is-- well, Android is not really a spec, is it?
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.360]   It's an operating system looking for hardware.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.600]   I mean, a lot of our thought process
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.280]   was that you build something that's very-- that has a front end.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.680]   It's sitting on top of Linux.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.960]   And then it just has a front end that is very controlled,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.280]   actually, that if you're just the average person buying it,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.400]   it's just a user interface.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.560]   And it just works.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.640]   And it has a lot of rules.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.600]   But if you are a hacker, you can open it up and do whatever
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:30.960]   you want with it.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   You can pull it off and get whatever you need.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.800]   And that was kind of the thought process
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.240]   that we had kind of arrived at.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.720]   Anybody installed-- well, I guess you probably all have--
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.240]   firmware 202 came out on Monday.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.160]   My phone seems to be working better.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.600]   Is it more reliable?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.240]   Some say they're saying it's faster.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.280]   Of course, that's the old car wash snappier.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.880]   You wash your car, it feels snappier.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.320]   I definitely think that my phone definitely
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.960]   feels snappier than before.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.200]   Yeah, I mean, just what my phone was like, oh, I mean,
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.320]   I was on 2.00, and it was--
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.520]   like, I'd hit-- I'd go to SMS, and I'd click on a button,
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.160]   and then I'd go have coffee, and then I'd come back,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.320]   and I can start typing again.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.080]   I mean, it was just-- it was horrible.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.960]   These revs are big.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.840]   This is 248 megabytes.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.160]   They're big.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.600]   Wow.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.520]   I think we're all still trying to figure out the best way
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.320]   to manage applications, because I was having exactly the same
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.560]   problems that Alex was having.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.080]   And then suddenly, I decided, you know what?
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.440]   I'm going to remove every single application.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.520]   I'm going to reinstall all of them all over again
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.920]   after doing the new firmware.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.600]   And I've had so fewer problems, both with overall stability
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   and the stability of individual apps.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.120]   I could never get Amos' messaging to work until again.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.320]   I just, again, felled that again.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.120]   Like I said earlier, started treated like an ordinary,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.200]   stupid computer instead of this breathtaking hand
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.160]   that'll touch the device.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.680]   Right.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.200]   It's an OK delete reinstall.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.920]   Start over, reinstall.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.880]   It's exactly--
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.840]   Where's the control alt-dell button on this?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.280]   Format and reinstall.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.200]   It works with-- even with iPhones, it works.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.640]   They--
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.960]   I don't know that, by the way.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.360]   So every time you do that, you owe me a dollar.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.520]   You do?
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.840]   Format and install.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.040]   Of course, Apple is, as usual, very opaque
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.760]   about what this does.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   It says bug fixes.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.200]   That's it, the bullet point, bug fixes.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.280]   We made it better.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.320]   It's better.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.720]   Some rumors, is it perhaps fixing
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.840]   that the 3G connectivity issues?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.520]   I haven't heard any reports pro or con on that.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.560]   But we were talking earlier that it had to be a hardware
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.680]   update, and now Steve Jobs says, no, we could fix it in firmware.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.440]   I don't think this is the fix, but maybe it is.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.000]   Net share still works according to Mac rumors.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.840]   That was the briefly-- the Null Rivers briefly sold app
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.680]   on the iTunes Store that allowed you to use your iPhone
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.720]   to connect an untethered connection to the internet
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.520]   with your laptop, which is such a great idea.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.960]   Also violates the AT&T contract, but they didn't break it,
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   which was surprising.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.120]   They could have broken it.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.440]   Yeah, it kind of stinks.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.400]   I don't have-- my broadband is coming on Friday
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.520]   at the new house.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.160]   And boy, was it galling for the first three days
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   to be looking at this 3G iPhone, knowing
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.320]   that there is a big, fat pipe to the internet,
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.080]   with a cap welded onto the end of it.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.440]   Sitting right there that you can't use.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.120]   Yeah, very frustrating.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.160]   Very frustrating.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.800]   Let's see, what other stories are in the news today.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.640]   Oh, you were having trouble with your magsafe.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.720]   Now, there have been two fire stories in the Mac world.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.400]   We're hearing stories of Nanos exploding,
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.000]   both in Japan and in Sweden.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.600]   One of our chatter says, little phone,
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.920]   a little nano of fire going on.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.080]   And then the magsafe connector has some troubles, too.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.040]   So what's been your story?
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.600]   Well, my story is I woke up at around 7.45 this morning,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.080]   having a dream of really odd smells burning.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.720]   And it turned out to be my magsafe connection.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   Wow.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.000]   Two feet from my bed.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.400]   It wasn't on fire, but it was just--
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.840]   again, you've had those dreams where reality starts
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.080]   to influence what's going on.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.040]   And it was enough to pull me out of the dream.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.560]   Thank goodness.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.840]   Suddenly, I'm wondering, well, something seems odd.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.920]   I looked at my MacBooks.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.720]   Oh, god.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.200]   Why is this--
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.360]   I was looking at the end of this connection to the MacBook
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.080]   and the light was out.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.920]   I was like, oh, damn.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.680]   It's something at this lodge.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.480]   So I traced it back and went to the floor.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.760]   I said, oh, it's probably this charred blackened bundle
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.200]   of wire sticking out for the end of it.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.920]   What happened was that the place where--
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.600]   and this seems to be the common failure point--
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.840]   that the point where the wire goes into the power brick,
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.280]   not the point where the magsafe connector goes into the MacBook
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.920]   seems to be prone to failure.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.880]   And looking back, it's obvious that my little power brick
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.080]   was having its own little crisis for quite some time.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.240]   Because about two months ago, I noticed
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.760]   that it was starting to get really unusually hot sometimes.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.520]   But it was still working.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.080]   OK, fine.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.240]   Then about a month ago, it would intermittently just
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.120]   sort of stop working.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.040]   And of course, with the magsafe, you instantly think, OK,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.360]   there's a little grain of some sort of fluff
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   in between the magnet and the MacBook
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.840]   that's causing it not to make contactologies.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.800]   But it wasn't predictable.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.600]   And then only now, I seem to empirically discover
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.680]   that the problem was frayed wires going into the power brick.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.840]   I mean, if you saw it, it does look rather scary.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.360]   And I'm glad that I keep my oil and gasoline soaked rags
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.480]   on the left-hand side of the bed and the power brick.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.800]   Thank goodness.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.880]   I'm just glad-- exactly.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   I mean, there but for the grace of God.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.120]   Well, Apple has an--
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.840]   It's actually making me think whether I should be keeping
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   those oil safe soaked rags on the bed anyway.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.640]   I'd put them in the basement, or maybe you've
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.000]   got a storage closet somewhere that you could just stick them
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.760]   in there.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.480]   I'm not going to sleep in the basement of the storage closet.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.840]   Oh, you need them, I see.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.400]   Let's do it.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   I see.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.320]   It's a treatment.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.720]   Just keep the bed where it is.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.840]   You move the rags.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.000]   Actually, Apple's offering free mags at replacements.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.320]   So apparently, there haven't been enough failures.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.400]   I've noticed that I have four or five power adapters
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.680]   for my laptop.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.200]   And I've noticed on two of them, they've become very frayed
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.120]   on the insert to where--
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.600]   right into the magsafe, right where the mags--
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.920]   Picture I'm seeing on Cult of Mac, which is right at the--
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.640]   not where Andy was talking about, but maybe the wire
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.160]   in general is just kind of--
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.080]   I don't know what it is, but I've had two of them
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.000]   that I've gotten to the point where I stopped using them
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.440]   because I just wasn't--
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.040]   I wasn't sure if there was going to be any problem or not.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.560]   I buy little ones and big ones, and I have them pretty much
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.400]   wherever I'm sitting for any long period of time.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.720]   I end up getting a new one, so I can just sit down and plug in
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   and go.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.040]   That's actually, I think, one of the smartest investments
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.280]   I can make is to buy multiple power connectors.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.160]   I just keep them plugged in where you go.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   It keeps your internal battery from cycling too often.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.880]   And it doesn't count as a cycle if you just bring it over
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.560]   and you plug it in immediately.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.040]   It doesn't count.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.960]   I noticed in my--
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.000]   I'm on little number eight.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.960]   On little number six, I noticed that my battery life got
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.440]   extended by-- rather, the life--
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   not the charge life, but the life of the battery hardware
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.200]   itself doubled and tripled when I stopped.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.160]   Check my email and then go downstairs into the living room
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.120]   and watch prices write and on battery for an hour
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.600]   and then going back into the office.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.280]   Once I kept a charger right there in the sofa,
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.560]   and it lost that opportunity to deplete for an hour
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.160]   every single day, suddenly, instead of having to buy a new
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.120]   battery every seven or eight months, I was buying one maybe
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.560]   after two years.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.440]   Well, go to the genius because he'll give you a new one.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.640]   I'm going to--
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.240]   and also going to tell him, you know what?
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.000]   Kick the hell up, I run war, too.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.200]   What do you do about that?
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.600]   I want to run war.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.240]   It's all smoky now.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.360]   Just make one out of stock.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.560]   I know you have them.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.080]   Yeah, Steve Jobs.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.400]   Call on the red phone if you have to.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.840]   Apple will also replace sparking iPod nanos,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.840]   but it's the first gen nanos they say they were--
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.080]   which released September 2005, and they say it only
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.960]   affects 0.001%.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.920]   Had to--
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.960]   they do admit there's a bad battery that one of the suppliers,
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.800]   I guess, had a bad battery.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.600]   They're sparky.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.160]   Sparky.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.120]   I still have one of those.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.520]   I mean, I have one of those old ones.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.960]   Which ones are those?
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.240]   Those are-- I think those are the little white ones,
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:30.840]   isn't it, aren't they?
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.680]   The candy.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.880]   Like the little chewing gum candy bar?
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.360]   They have a screen, though, right?
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.280]   No, they're not-- yeah, they're a little screen.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.880]   They're like a little candy bar.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.960]   Like, not quite the-- not like the super little shuffles,
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.160]   but they're like the ones there.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.680]   And I-- that's still my backup one when I'm traveling.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.160]   Because you know, you can't be away from media for more than--
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:51.920]   No.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.560]   Two minutes.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.360]   So I usually carry three iPods at some time.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.240]   I have my-- you have a shuffle because you never know
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.080]   when you're going to work out.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   And then you have this backup one that just has all your favorites
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.280]   just in case you run out of power on your iPhone.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.600]   Very clever.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.560]   I'm very prepared.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.440]   I don't want to be out in the cold without something
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.080]   to listen to.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.480]   Well, we could lend some credence to the rumor
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.120]   there might be new iPods in September,
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.320]   because I, in fact, did just buy an iPod classic.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.080]   Oh, very good.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.880]   So maybe--
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.400]   Now, why did you buy an iPod classic?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:20.960]   I'm buying one.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.840]   I'm getting ready to buy one.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.800]   Abby is going to France in a week.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.960]   And her--
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.800]   Yeah, I might see her there.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.520]   Her-- yeah, you might.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.000]   It's a small country.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.480]   It's going to be in Paris.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.000]   She's-- you know, she's a few hours away.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.480]   You could just hop by.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.480]   She-- her cousin drove over her old iPod.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.160]   And so she-- I figured a classic was a good choice.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.920]   I've got her the Silver One.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.840]   I think they're very pretty.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.080]   And you know, what is it?
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:44.640]   80 gigs?
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.880]   That's a lot.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:46.920]   It's amazing.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.800]   And they have 160, but there's no way.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.640]   I was going to give her 160.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.440]   And it matches her air.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.080]   She's now going to look like the most affluent student
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.640]   in France.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   She's-- I'm going to--
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.840]   should have given her a gold Hermes scarf.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.120]   She's there for a year?
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.560]   Nine months.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.560]   Yeah, the full semester.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.440]   Full season.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.880]   Whole year, whatever it is.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.400]   Ah, I should fill that iPod up, of course, with Audible Books.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.560]   If I had any sense, I would.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.600]   Audible is our sponsor.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.560]   We remind you, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.000]   That's the place to go to get a free audible book of your choice.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.080]   Many great choices out there.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.560]   Andy, we haven't had you on on so long.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.320]   I imagine you've come up with something new.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.080]   Yeah, I've got a really great recommendation
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.160]   that just was released on--
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.600]   I think simultaneously in hardcover and audio and everything.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.480]   There is a wonderful blog called Waiter Rant.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.520]   I believe it's waiterrant.net.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:46.280]   It is a blog wonderfully written by a professional waiter.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   Oh.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   Oh.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.920]   It gives you all the stories of what life is like when you're
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   basically selling food to snooty people.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.200]   Some of whom are very rational and very nice
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.920]   and wonderful to work for.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   Other people are just unrealistic.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.720]   Who always want to see the owner and always insist
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.120]   that they always got-- no, there's a free table over there.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.600]   I'm just going to take that table over there, no matter
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.960]   what the waiter says.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.280]   And it really goes beyond what you think
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.880]   it's going to be-- you're anticipating four chapters
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.360]   on things that I've seen spit or placed in the dishes
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.720]   of people who can sense the dishes.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.520]   And of course, some of that.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.080]   But what I like about it is one of those books
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.440]   that really does a great job explaining
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   the intricacies of what has to go on in order
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.360]   to get you that plate of risotto.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   And make sure that it's there before you get your entree.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.520]   What happens when you change an order at the last minute?
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.240]   What happens when you linger at a table a little longer
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.080]   than you should?
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.280]   What effect does that have on the back of the house?
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.200]   What happens in the kitchen when things are going on
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   in the front?
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.960]   On top of all that, he's just a really, really good writer.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.640]   His identity--
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.360]   He's anonymous.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.800]   It says the waiter.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   Exactly.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.320]   He has secret identity until publication of the book
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.520]   because now, of course, he said, you know what?
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   I can either go on the Today Show and show my face
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.960]   or it could continue to be hidden away.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.320]   And he said, you know what?
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.880]   I think it'd be fun to talk to Matt Lauer.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.480]   But he used to be a divinity student.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.040]   He decided the priesthood was not for him.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.240]   And then he worked in a mental institution for a little while
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.000]   and went into waiting, I think, about six, seven, eight years
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.160]   ago.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.720]   So he really has a unique perspective
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.080]   and it's a compelling story.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.160]   It's been described as there was a book
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.280]   few years ago by Anthony Bourdain called Kitchen
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.680]   Confidential that explained what it's
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.320]   like to run a restaurant, what it's like to be a cook.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.520]   This is the compliment to that book.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.120]   And if that was about what happens
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.920]   in the relationship between the kitchen and the customer,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.320]   this is between the relationship between the customers,
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.760]   the waiter, and the kitchen.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.160]   Like I said, I've been an avid reader of the blog.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.440]   And it's not just a simple case of him cutting and pasting
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.920]   the best bits from the blog into a book.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.080]   I'm about halfway through it right now.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.400]   And I recognize some stories that he's decided to retail.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.120]   But it's pretty much its own thing.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.920]   And it really is quite good.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.800]   It will make you, if you were a 20%
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.400]   tipper before reading this book, you will become a 25% tipper.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.040]   Oh, wow.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.160]   That's a bad reason to read the book.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.880]   That's a reason not to read it.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.920]   Or let me put it this way.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.840]   If you find yourself getting an unusual amount of colds
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.320]   and nausea after leaving a restaurant and berating the staff,
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.400]   this will give you the skills you
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.120]   need to be healthy after you have that meal, let's say.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.880]   This is good.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.600]   This is good.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.040]   Waiter Ranch, thanks for the tip,
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   confessions of a cynical waiter can be yours.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.000]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.240]   I just, it always amazes me that the wide variety of great
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.360]   reading or listening, I guess I should say that you could
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.960]   find it audible.com, 50,000 books, not just books,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.880]   radio shows, lectures, performances.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.680]   It's just wonderful.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.640]   audible.com/macbreak.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.800]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.120]   And Andy, I thank you for your tip.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.480]   By the way, Titus Grown is great.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.720]   You recommended that some months ago.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.560]   I finally got around to it.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.720]   And ironically, so is Roz.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.160]   Roz, who's rowing across the Pacific is reading it
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.480]   and loving it too.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.680]   So we both thank you for that great recommendation
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.440]   some months ago.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.680]   It's time for our Macbreak picks of the week.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.280]   And I'll start with you, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.320]   Your pick last week was several Alexes.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.880]   Have you come down in price?
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.840]   I have, I have.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.760]   I've come down in price.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.240]   I actually saw a new application at the new Media Expo.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.200]   Oh, cool.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.280]   So this is a, it's about a seventh of an hour.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.400]   So I like that about a hundred bucks.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.920]   Hundred, $129.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.600]   And it is by Ambrosia software and it's called Wiretown
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.440]   in Beware.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.280]   Did you see this?
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.840]   I did. They pulled me over.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.680]   Oh, man.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.440]   Now, I'm using Audio Hyjek Pro.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.920]   And this seems like it's Ambrosia's version of that.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.080]   What are the differences?
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.680]   But Audio Hyjek Pro from my experience,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.640]   and I haven't used it for a while because it requires,
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.760]   it relies on sound flour, right?
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.600]   Right.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.440]   To do the stuff.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.520]   And I have, we've had a lot of conflicts with sound flour.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.360]   I shouldn't say right.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.880]   I don't know if Audio Hyjek Pro.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.120]   I believe it does.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.600]   And we've had some issues with Audio Hyjek Pro,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.040]   and specifically with just some of our sound applications,
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.200]   and trying to do things that are really complex.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.920]   And we may be misusing it.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.760]   But basically what Wiretap anywhere does
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.800]   is it lets you, you have a bunch of things coming in
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   and you can feed them out to a bunch of other things.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.400]   So what I mean by that is it lets you link up
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.080]   for instance, if you have three USB mics,
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.160]   you can hook all of them.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.920]   If you have three USB connections to your computer,
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.440]   you can hook all the mics in.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.360]   And then you can tell them I want all three mics
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.200]   to go into Skype for instance.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.640]   And so you could have three people over here
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.840]   and have them be able to, you could pipe that all into Skype
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   or you could pipe it into Skype and iChat,
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.280]   or you could pipe it into, and you can also output
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.040]   from your interface.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.480]   So you could output Skype into something else.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.920]   So you could theoretically output Skype,
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.160]   for instance, into GarageBand.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.560]   So the output of this sound goes into that area.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.240]   So it basically lets you reroute either application
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.960]   outputs or hardware inputs and pipe them
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.160]   into other applications.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.920]   You could theoretically, you could theoretically
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.480]   have people on Skype, you could connect people
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.920]   from Skype and iChat together by having the output of Skype
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.560]   go into the input of iChat.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.040]   And so if you have people on different ones,
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.880]   I don't know why you do that.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   But the idea is that you really have this kind of open ended,
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.520]   I can grab all the hardware on one side,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.720]   I can pipe it in, and when they first showed it to me,
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.640]   I was kind of like, I don't really know how much I'd use this.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.520]   And then as I started seeing all the things
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.960]   that I could connect to it, and the idea for a lot of people
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.760]   have like these little USB mics, you might have a bunch
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.600]   of plantronics or whatever, and you want to just very quickly
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   throw everybody together and do a round table,
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.920]   but you have someone on Skype and you
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.400]   want to be able to see all those.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.760]   And as I said, my experience with soundflower-based
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.480]   applications has been not really good.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.320]   And so I pretty much won't put it on any computer that we have.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:07.760]   And so this one is really much more straight to the metal,
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.240]   so to speak.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.400]   And one thing that in Brojio tends to be really good at
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.000]   is really writing code that's really
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.440]   taking full advantage of everything
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.160]   that the operating system provides.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.120]   There's no in-between.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.840]   It's really solid, whether it's snaps or a lot of the other
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.720]   stuff that are wiretap or all these other things.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.000]   It really is going to be one of the most robust solutions
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   generally in their field.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.320]   Good.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   Well, I'm excited.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.120]   And Brojio does great stuff.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.320]   It's kind of especially for people
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.200]   who do recording of some kind, but a lot of people
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:40.880]   do on the Mac.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.000]   It's not uncommon.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.400]   And I think that it's just one of those things that even if you
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.200]   don't have any hardware outputs, being
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.720]   able to reroute all of your--
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.840]   it's a little geeky.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.400]   But being able to reroute your individual outputs,
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.200]   you could have and pipe them all into one thing.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.520]   I think that a lot-- when you start thinking about that being
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.800]   possible, as our listeners might--
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.280]   if you start thinking about, oh, I
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.160]   could-- there's an application that would allow me to do that,
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.600]   you'll start running into times when you realize, oh,
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.320]   it'd be really nice if I could get the sound out
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.920]   of this application and pipe it into this application.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.680]   Very cool.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.960]   Great pick.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.560]   And Brojio software, it's available now around $129.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   And what is it called?
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.960]   wiretap studio?
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.560]   It's called--
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.320]   no, there is a wiretap studio.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.520]   So they have wiretap?
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.880]   wiretap studio.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.280]   This is wiretap anywhere.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:25.840]   Anywhere.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.640]   So they've wiretap pro wiretap studio now wiretap anywhere.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.120]   And they still have the free wiretap
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.840]   that you could just kind of get started with all this.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.320]   I think they do.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.080]   Because that was kind of the great entry gateway drug
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.320]   for all this wiretap nonsense.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:39.680]   Good pick.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.760]   Thank you, Alex.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.000]   It is time for Andy's pick.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.320]   Actually, before we do Andy's pick,
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.440]   I do want to mention our good friends at Visa.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.520]   They bring you this show.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.640]   And we want to remind you that with every purchase Visa
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.200]   prevents, detects, and resolves online fraud.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.040]   When you go online to buy software, whether it's--
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.080]   and nowadays, nobody goes to a store
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.200]   to buy shrink-wrapped software.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.600]   If you're going to buy wiretap anywhere,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.760]   you're going to buy it online.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.360]   And you're going to use, I hope, if you've been listening
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.760]   a long time, you know Visa.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.080]   We have better things to think about when shopping online.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.680]   Do I want to wiretap studio?
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.640]   Don't wiretap pro?
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.920]   Do I want to audio hijack pro?
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.200]   You don't have to worry about getting defrauded online.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.880]   That's the last thing you should have to think about.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.160]   And if you use your Visa, you don't.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.920]   All purchases are safe and secure with Visa.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.160]   They prevent, detect, and resolve--
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.200]   and that's the big one--
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.400]   underscore that resolve online fraud--
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.880]   so that you're not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.680]   When you shop online, shop with Visa.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.160]   That's peace of mind.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.480]   That's what we use here at Macbreak Weekly.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.080]   Andy and I are co.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.240]   What's your pick of the week?
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.120]   Well, I'm in the--
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.280]   hopefully, the last week or so of writing an update
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.920]   to my iPhone book.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.520]   And I'm having exactly the same sort of adventures
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.720]   that I had when I was finishing the first edition, which
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.000]   is things change so quickly and so--
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.120]   such wonderful things keep happening that I keep having
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.520]   to throw things away and start them all over again.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.680]   And a brand new category of software
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.400]   has emerged in the past two weeks that
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.960]   has caused me to increase it from adding a section
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.280]   to an existing chapter to creating a brand new chapter
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.920]   for it to entitling this chapter, the best damn app
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.120]   you will ever get for the iPhone.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.760]   Holy cow!
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.080]   Yes.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   The developers have moved off of the flashlight apps.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.000]   And now there are at least four different people
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.480]   making apps for the iPhone that turns the iPhone
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.320]   into a web dev server.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:34.840]   Wow.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.560]   What this is, is this is an application--
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.680]   the category is-- an application where you launch it
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.240]   and essentially it will act as a file server
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.280]   on your local subnet, which means that all of a sudden,
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.480]   if I want to put files on my iPhone,
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   I don't have to necessarily go through iTunes.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.800]   I don't necessarily have to convert it to another format
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   or sync.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   All I have to do is in any operating system that supports
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.360]   web dev, which is, of course, Mac OS, which is, of course,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.080]   Windows, which is, of course, Linux, just simply open it
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:06.960]   as a web dev share.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.400]   It will mount on your desktop as a network storage device.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.840]   And suddenly, you have a bucket into which you can drop
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.400]   any file, any document, anything.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.080]   Now, this is cool.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:23.160]   However, the ways in which you can exploit and articulate
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.440]   this are really wonderful.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.360]   OK.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.400]   Let's start off with the obvious.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.720]   It means that you have 16 gigabytes of storage on your iPhone
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.160]   3G, and you're only using half of it.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.920]   So OK, cool.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.440]   You get four or five gigs that you can now carry around
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.960]   documents instead of spending all of $23 on a keychain drive.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.160]   OK.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.280]   The next thing, though, you can do,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.560]   is the bane of our existence before an application like this
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.480]   came along was, how do I take the flight con for me--
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.160]   oh, my flight itinerary, my hotel reservations,
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.760]   everything from Travelocity.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.680]   How do I keep it on my iPhone so that even if I'm
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.640]   in the middle of the air, even if I can't get a cell signal,
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.160]   so I can get that information back and find out,
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.280]   who do I call because they're not honoring my reservation.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   Before an application like this, you would need to, again,
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.760]   make sure you have connection to the internet
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.640]   so that you could, again, download it, email it to yourself,
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.040]   or do one of the many, many wonderful tricks that
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.960]   are in the first generation of the book.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.800]   With this one, all I got to do is print it to a PDF,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.600]   print it to a Word file, whatever,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   drag the file onto your iPhone, and suddenly, just
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.000]   by tapping on it, because the iPhone operating system
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.680]   has built-in media readers that include PDF,
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.320]   you can simply read it directly from local storage.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.680]   You don't need an internet connection.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.080]   You don't need nothing.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.840]   That's pretty damn cool.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.240]   But let's go one further, shall we?
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.680]   A second bane of our existence, this
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.760]   goes all the way back to iPod 1.0 is the fact
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.200]   that you cannot just arbitrarily put media files on the thing.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.040]   You always have to go through iTunes.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.760]   And if you have set it up so that you've
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.320]   set up a specific relationship between your iPod
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.800]   and one desktop computer, you can't even just
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.280]   go to any copy of iTunes.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.920]   If, again, if you're spending the weekend at a friend's house,
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.040]   meanwhile, three, four, five, six, seven, eight new podcasts
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:11.680]   have an updated.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.520]   Plus, you've gotten this really great new album
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.320]   that you bought.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.960]   You can't just toss that stuff on your iPhone
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.720]   for the drive back home.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.400]   You can do this on the cheap as elephant dung,
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.000]   things you can buy in any drugstore,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.840]   because they mount just as a USB device.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.240]   You can't do that on the iPhone.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.520]   But if you have these web dev apps, no problem.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.200]   Just take your audio file, take your movie file,
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.800]   take any file you want.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.840]   Just drag it right into that shared volume.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.280]   Then, because, once again, the iPhone operating system
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.520]   has a built-in reader for certain types of video files,
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.920]   certain types of audio files, you don't even
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.200]   go to the music player.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.720]   Go open up your file browser that the iPhone ended this.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.960]   To double tap on the file you want to play and starts playing.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.160]   It's just that easy.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.240]   It's one of those things where you install it and you will use it
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.200]   and you will find new ways to use it.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.280]   Now, things have gotten a little bit complicated,
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.960]   because, once again, this has become one of those things
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.600]   like the flashlight app, where one person wrote it
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.120]   and then everyone else realized, oh, actually, this
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.480]   isn't all that difficult to do.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.720]   I want to do my version of this.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.640]   I want to stick my own hand in the till.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.680]   And now, there are at least three or four.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.080]   The two best ones are an app called--
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.920]   simply called Files and an app called Data Case.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.280]   They're both $6.99, cheapest chips.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.520]   But Data Case is my favorite, because it adds the most value
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.640]   to the concept.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.440]   In addition to-- it doesn't simply put a shared volume
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.920]   on the network.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.440]   You can have a password protected shared volume
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.680]   for the stuff that you want-- for your private access.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.040]   You can also have a public folder,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.680]   so that just by virtue of the fact
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.640]   that you're wandering around in the office carrying
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.360]   your iPhone in your pocket, if this app is running,
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   if people can simply drag documents
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.000]   and can find your iPhone, drag documents into it.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.840]   They can't see anything else inside there.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.400]   All they can do is drag things into this private folder.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.120]   And when you get home, you find out just like picking up
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.360]   cat hair on your coat by walking through your friend's house.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.640]   Hey, look, you've picked up those documents
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.080]   that you're supposed to get.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.040]   You can also create specific volumes
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.840]   so that you can create sub-volume for specific intentions.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.480]   The only drawback of Data Case compared to Files
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:25.320]   is that I think it is a little bit more fiddly to set up.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.200]   Files set up perfectly first time, first try.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.480]   Setting up a web dev share is not as simple as an eye disc.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.640]   It should work with just a few clicks,
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.160]   but the first time you do it, just create an alias to it,
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.560]   then you're good to go.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   - Could you do it with, say, Jungle Disc
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.360]   or some other web dev server?
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.200]   - Any, meaning, access it or--
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.000]   - Yeah, access it or--
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.640]   - Anything that supports web dev,
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   it is not a special flavor of web dev,
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.800]   it's just a standard web dev server.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.000]   I've accessed it as a matter of fact from other phones,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.960]   just by virtue of the fact that I've got
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.600]   a web dev access on this old Palm machine
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.880]   that happened to have rattling around.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.880]   - Very cool.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.480]   - It is plain vanilla, like I said,
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.760]   it's one of those things where it's $6.99 for God's sake.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.480]   It's barely anything.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.280]   And you will find ways to use it.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.080]   Again, it has become one of my default ways
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.920]   of moving media onto the iPhone,
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.560]   especially considering how long it often takes
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:29.000]   to synchronize an iPhone through iTunes.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.200]   It's so much simpler just to, again,
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.520]   launch this application, then go into the Finder,
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.960]   drag those four new MP3s onto the device and then leave.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.200]   And I'm gone in three minutes
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.000]   instead of waiting 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.440]   For doing it, whatever it has to do,
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.720]   getting into a Zen meditation mode before it feels
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.680]   that it's prepared to undock and go forth into the world.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.120]   - So there are two of these.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.200]   One is called files, is F-I-L-E-S?
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   - F-I-L-E-S.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.040]   - Okay, and the other--
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:55.880]   - And the other--
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.720]   - And the other one--
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.560]   - And the other one is called--
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.280]   The one I'm recommending is data case, again,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.240]   because it has more features to it.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.800]   It's a little bit more difficult to set up,
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.680]   but here we're talking about if files is
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.200]   on nine and a half out of 10 in ease of use,
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.480]   data cases may be an eight, eight and a half.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.920]   - Very cool.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.680]   Andy, an Akos pick of the day.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.720]   Now mine is kind of related in some ways.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.040]   It's a way that you can share your iTunes
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:26.080]   over the internet with an iPhone or other users
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.720]   on a PC or a Mac.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.960]   And 30 of your friends can also do so.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.120]   Have you seen Simplify?
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:32.960]   It's an iPhone app.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.920]   Actually, it's been out for a while on the Mac,
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.560]   but now you can do it on the iPhone, which is very cool.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.440]   It works on iTunes on PC or Mac,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.560]   Win app on the PC.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.880]   It works with Front Row as well.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.720]   And if you're using Linux,
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.960]   it works with a program called Rhythm Box.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.120]   This is absolutely free.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.240]   You go to SimplifyMedia.com
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.760]   and you'll download the desktop application
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.920]   and put it on your computer.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.880]   It's scanning right now.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.640]   It's scanning my iTunes.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.040]   This is the Office iMac.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.680]   It's sharing the files onto my Office iMac.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.000]   Now anybody who is a friend, up to 30 people,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.640]   anywhere in the world can listen to my tunes
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.400]   or watch my videos on their computer.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.480]   And again, PC Mac or Linux.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.400]   But now this new, this really makes it very cool.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.800]   I can also listen to my music on my iPhone.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.080]   So I'm running the Free Simplify client on my iPhone.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:25.920]   And there they are.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   There are my albums from my Mac.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.160]   And I can listen using Wi-Fi.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.240]   It even works with 3G and not so well with Edge.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.480]   But it's not just my music.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   It could be yours, Andy.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.240]   It could be Alex's as well.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.160]   This is a really, I don't know how long
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.320]   this is gonna stay on the iTunes store.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.400]   So you might wanna,
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.520]   might be another one of those things.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.720]   You wanna download quickly.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.800]   But what, this is just fantastic.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.640]   A great way to download or not,
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.720]   well you're not downloading your streaming music
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:04.000]   from your over Wi-Fi or Edge or 3G over
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.400]   from your Mac or your friends' Macs.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.360]   Simplifymedia.com at zero, Alex is absolutely free.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.360]   And I wanna thank the person to turn me on to it,
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.680]   but I can't remember who it was.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.720]   But it's just really, really cool.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.080]   - Sounds fantastic.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.880]   - Yeah, it's kind of what, I would say it's a must have.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.720]   - No, I downloaded the remote immediately.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.280]   Was like the number one, 'cause I thought,
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.400]   oh cool, I'll be able to listen to my iTunes on my phone
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.360]   and know it's the other way around.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.160]   I could control my iTunes on my computer from my phone.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.680]   And actually it's really great, I like it,
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.280]   especially if you have an Apple TV to be able to use
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.720]   the remote on the Apple TV is spectacular.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.840]   But this does what I thought remote originally would do,
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.000]   which is it connects over the internet,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.560]   not just over a land, but over the internet,
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.560]   to any of 30 computers,
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.360]   you have to run the Simplifymedia stub.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.240]   It's a little small program on the desktop,
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.080]   and that's what's sharing it, and it works,
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:57.920]   and it works great.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.560]   It's kind of like having an airport express
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.960]   everywhere you go, I guess.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.960]   Very, very cool.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.760]   So you don't have to put all your music on your iPhone,
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.600]   as long as you can get online,
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.280]   you can still listen to it.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.160]   Simplifymedia.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.440]   I don't think, well, I haven't tried it with video,
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.120]   I don't think it would work with video,
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.880]   but it definitely works great with music.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.840]   And by the way, I have some nice other features.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.400]   It looks up, for instance, the lyrics.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.720]   So it's actually looking up the lyrics of the song
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.360]   I'm listening to, I guess it's getting that from the internet.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.680]   More information about the artist.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.120]   This is additional to the stuff that's on my computer.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.480]   Simplifymedia.com, and then go to the iTunes iPhone store,
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.200]   the App Store, and you can download Simplifymedia
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.320]   for the phone, but you need it to be running
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.280]   on a computer before it works on a phone.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.040]   Very, very cool.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.560]   Hey, there's three great picks, gentlemen.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.760]   I think it's time to wrap this puppy up.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   Thank you all for being here,
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.320]   and Merlin Mann is on break,
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.520]   he's on giving some speeches,
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.800]   but he'll, I think he'll be back next week.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.240]   We may move our record day,
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.920]   so watch the Twit Live calendar,
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.160]   if you like to watch live,
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.040]   because the record day may move,
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.960]   'cause Wednesday's not good for Scott Born anymore,
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.280]   so I think we're gonna try doing it on,
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.200]   well, we have to figure it out.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.120]   Tuesdays, Thursdays, I'm not sure.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.920]   Watch carefully, we'll negotiate,
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.080]   and we'll solve the schedule.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.520]   Where is the schedule?
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.360]   The Twit Live schedule.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:21.640]   Twitlive.tv, there's a Google Calendar link at the bottom.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   You can either subscribe to it in your iCal,
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.240]   or you can go to it as a webpage.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:29.120]   There's HTML, RSS, and ICS.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.960]   So you can get it, it's a twitlive.tv.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.680]   Not very well exposed, I apologize.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.520]   There's a lot of things I need to do with that webpage.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.120]   I mean, kind of waiting,
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.840]   'cause StickAm was gonna help us
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.080]   with the new player and stuff,
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.400]   and that hasn't happened quite yet,
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.640]   so there's a lot of things I wanna do,
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.040]   including put a wiki up there,
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.040]   so people can put stuff that they know
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   or wanna help out with.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.240]   So twitlive.tv is right at the bottom there.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.240]   It says XML, iCal, if you have iCal,
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.880]   you just download that and you subscribe to that.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.920]   Right click and subscribe.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.480]   If you just wanna look at the web base,
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.520]   just click HTML and you can bookmark that,
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.920]   and it's always up to date, I keep it up to date.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.520]   So you can always see what shows we're recording and so forth.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.920]   Andy, you're not close with this Chicago Sun Times
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.840]   in the celestial waste of bandwidth.com,
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:26.840]   CWOB.com, and a great friend of the Mac everywhere.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.200]   - Friend of all working people's enemy
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.720]   of the industrial bourgeoisie.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.880]   I want that known because, you know,
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.520]   October 3rd is coming up.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.560]   We all thought it was five years of plenty of time,
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.360]   but it's coming up a lot faster than we thought,
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.120]   so make sure you guys know,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.240]   I am friend of the working man,
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.200]   hated enemy of the industrial bourgeoisie oppressor.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.600]   - I didn't get the memo, is that when the revolution is,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.560]   is October 3rd?
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.200]   - Oh, you didn't get it?
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.680]   No, nothing, you know, you know, me Leo,
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.280]   just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.880]   - A joker, you're such a joker.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.600]   Let me just add that to the Twit Live calendar,
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.880]   October 3rd up against the wall.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.840]   Okay, we are gonna be back next week
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.720]   with another Mac break.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.880]   I thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.640]   I'm Leo LaPorte, another Mac break, that's broke.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:31.800]   (upbeat music)
