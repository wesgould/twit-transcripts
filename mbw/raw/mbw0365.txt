[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.040]   It's gonna be a little slow for the next couple of weeks as we wait with baited breath
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.000]   Does that mean you have fish bait on your breath or is it? I don't know what it means Andy Anaco is here for the Chicago Sun times
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200]   he has a
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.800]   Torrent behind him. I'm not torrenting. No, that's that's I purchased I purchased boardwalk empire legally
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.520]   That is is that about well ask you about in a second also Renee Richie from i'm or calm. He has us behind him. I
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.560]   Do that like grand attempted sharing ah?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.760]   Aren't you sweet?
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.840]   And the reason I have a fire extinguisher on my table here is because you may remember if you saw a tweet on Sunday
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.000]   I accidentally knocked an entire mug of liquid about six ounces of water into the keyboard of this
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.600]   2013 MacBook Air
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.920]   Yeah, that was kind of the word I said it was close to the word I said
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.120]   Veronica screamed leap left into the air with her gear and got it away from it, but there was a big puddle in it
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.000]   So I turned it off as recommended. I couldn't pull the battery, but we did actually Burke
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.680]   But Quinn did a great job. He put in a bag of rice. Oh good. You've got video. Thank God
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.800]   You got a bag of rice is Ryan blocks. Yeah, here we go
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.120]   Is everyone's gonna be I just put it that's like gross. That's
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah, you're all right. Okay. You see her leaping
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   I didn't scream or anything or howl I was calm the crisis is Leo la port. I'm just calm
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.200]   And so we did the rice thing now Andy. I didn't know this but you had done a
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.560]   scientific test
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   Decicants well there's there's between a scientific test and simply abusing the abusing when a phone company lets you have six phones
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.280]   We're gonna destroy them to try different like waters water
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.640]   recovery systems
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   Yeah, no T mobile gave me six phones
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.800]   So they got like five different like urban legends about what to do with with a phone when you when you run it through the wash
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.360]   So load up a pair of pants full of phones ran through the water laundry twice
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   Kept kept one as a control and then tried I think it was
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.400]   bearing it in rice bearing it in
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.520]   desiccant
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.440]   vodka which was one running it through the dishwasher on the dry cycle and I think the fifth was a
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.720]   Yeah, the fifth was do nothing at all just like not use it and the only two methods that worked were they fresh
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.560]   Step and the rice so you put it in kitty litter
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   Right not not just any kitty litter
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.520]   First first of all fresh that's got just any kitty litter mrs. Jones
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.360]   Unless unless like this was all just deployed to like convince your boss at all well
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.720]   I have to get the new gold iPhone because look what happened not not only that my cat peed all over
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.920]   What are you gonna make me do hold this up to my face all the time?
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.200]   But yeah, what's the
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.360]   There's a kind of kitty litter that's actually like desiccant crystals and it's not clay
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.480]   It's not powder anything with that's it's those like ice it's it's those breaking bad looking blue crystals ones when the cats step on it releases
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.600]   odor suppressors, right? It's like 100% silicate and see and oh so is that what it is?
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.080]   It's it's silicate is it is nothing but the contents of what those little like packets of a deschender
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.680]   It does say it has activated charcoal in it activated carbon
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.360]   Okay, so it's deodorizing as wallets dry
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.440]   Exactly, but whatever there is a kind that is just nothing but deskin crystals and oh okay
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.200]   Maybe so this is a different kind of fresh silicates. This is a different kind of fresh step right?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.240]   That yeah, that's that's the kind so again. You want the blue breaking bad crystals. Oh it does look like
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.200]   Heisenberg made it. I love that
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.360]   Okay, and you just seal it up seal it up inside a bag
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.760]   So no other air can get in and so that the crystals or the rice is just pulling moisture out of the device and not out of the air
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.160]   Leave it for a day or two and that was the only method that worked and the rice worked
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.840]   The rice worked they the crystals worked
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.200]   Actually, I think I also did another one with if you know somebody who uses a hearing aid
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.640]   There is actually a drying device that you probably have which is specifically for like drying out a hearing aid
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.880]   Like if it gets all sweated up or if it gets like wet or something like that that worked great, too
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.640]   But that's like a hundred dollar thing and you probably can't just run to the store in a panic
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   By one of those but you can get rice you can get you can get creak fresh step
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.000]   Well the bottom line is that that happens Sunday. We let it stay for third
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.800]   I guess that's 36 hours in the rice there. Okay one negative do seal the rice into its own thing
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   Because there's there's little vent holes in the back of the MacBook Air
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.080]   For you know that and they're still rattling a little bit
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:04.000]   So some of the rice lots of the rice rice like about a quarter cup of rice got in the actual inside the laptop
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.320]   But I think it's all right powered it up. It's working fine. No, no appreciable issues
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.480]   So there you go and that was rice next time we're buying some fresh stuff crystal even using the pixel Leo
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   You know the this isn't I almost did yeah, you know and the problem of the pixel is it's got issues
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.920]   Yes
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.680]   With it, you know, I like the touch screen. I wish Apple do one of that
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.600]   But the problem is this it's issues with our black magic video card capture
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.960]   Anyway enough said but that's that's good news. Also by the way that is not just everyday water
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   That was was that Alhambra water?
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.600]   It was from the you know the water delivery guy
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   So it's high quality water probably didn't have a lot of dissolved metals in it
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.040]   So that's good too
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.240]   Also, it's it's it shows you how how nice it is to have these completely solid state machines
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   They're so tightly put together to begin with and
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.560]   If you you can take a circuit board get it just like stopping wet
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.440]   And if you just simply let it dry out and there's nothing in there
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.040]   They'll cause metal to corrode right it will actually mean there's nothing
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.040]   There's a very good likelihood that things will work work out fine. I did a article late
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:23.720]   Early this year about a camera that I'd found buried in the mud at the bottom of the lagoon in the Boston Public Garden
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.160]   They drain it once a year so they can like you know
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.200]   Medume maintenance and stuff like before they open it up for the season found a camera buried completely in mud
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.920]   and
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:39.160]   Was able to get a because they have these swan boats that will do a tour of the lagoon beautiful things and of course
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.480]   and of course people are taking pictures, but la la loom it just drops off the thing and gets a gets into the water and
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:52.320]   Pop the pop the memory card out and the contacts leading to the memory storage package inside that car were corroded
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.520]   And it couldn't work
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.320]   But drive savers was able to get the pictures off of the memory once they just resawder those connections
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.920]   So and this this thing was like buried in mud for two years
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.280]   The last pictures of course a picture of someone a picture taken from off the side of a boat. So I'm guessing that you know
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.600]   off a boat June June 2010 was indeed that last the last time with the day it was
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.760]   So it just goes to show you that like electronics
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.840]   They want to work for you. There's a place for you
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   They are pleased to work for you and if you give them half a chance they will work
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.640]   So me in the chat from saying and I wonder if this is true that you know
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.200]   I know the iPhone has a little 3M strip that turns color when moisture hits it in fact
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.840]   They that happened to me when I dropped my phone in a liquid pill and the genius took a little
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.440]   flashlight pen light and looked into the
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.920]   Earbud hole and you could see it and it had changed color. So we knew about what does Apple do the same thing
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.640]   Yeah, there it is. There's a little red strip that indicates moisture does Apple do the same thing with the with the laptops
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   Does anybody know I don't know so many the charm says they do that be interesting
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.040]   I think it's bad to lie to an Apple genius in general the more honest you are the better
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.080]   Because remember they do have the we're awesome policy right?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:07.000]   I did I did a piece last year trying to talk and talking to as many current and former geniuses
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.240]   I could and they really do have that power
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.680]   If you are honest if you're honest with them and if you try to take care of your device
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.680]   They will not it's not unlikely that they will say okay
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.480]   You tried you did your best you just had a bad accident
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.720]   We happen to have a couple of extras that we can spend and we're gonna spend one of these on you
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.120]   Go go with God and and send no more
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.080]   They're pretty good about that, but what they don't like is if you say I don't know what happened the screen
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.200]   Just I woke up and it just stopped working about this about this two weeks ago
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.960]   It suddenly stopped working and smelling like public garden lagoon water
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.000]   And now I want to know what you're exactly not the right way to approach it
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.360]   I don't remember if I bought Apple care plus on this thing or not would plus I walked in with my 4s
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.040]   When it got hit by fireworks, and I just explained, you know very earnestly that it got hit by fire
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.120]   Wait a minute. There's there's more to that story. I'd like to hear it was new years
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.680]   And I went to a friend he was setting off fireworks and one of them decided to make an attempt for my life
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.560]   Valiantly my iPhone 4 at your life. Yeah, it took it right on the screen and the olephobic coating kind of bubbled up
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   So it felt like sandpaper
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.840]   I
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.560]   Took it in and I showed it to them
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.320]   And they said they'd never seen that before and you know
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.360]   Sometimes that's a benefit when they've never seen it before because I'll capture it and they gave you a very stern lecture about taking better
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.200]   Care of my my stuff and then they just swapped it out and I put in my iCloud password and I left with an identical phone
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.080]   I could do without the lecture. It's not your fault
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.200]   Somebody shot a firework at you if they're gonna swap up my phone for nothing they'll look they can lecture me all the way
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.480]   I guess you're right. It's how I felt. I guess you're right
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:48.000]   Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You have a copy of the Bible on their body chance because historically that's what prevents disaster from actually hitting your person
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.420]   Yeah, it was in my pocket. It was that you know that gold
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.440]   Scotch flask and I took the bullet for me. Yeah, I hear that happening people in the Bible and a photograph of a piece of the
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.200]   Love that. I'm gonna I guess there is a way here
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.680]   I can get my serial number to see if I purchased yeah, there's my serial number
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:13.240]   Let me say copy that and you can go to check your service and support coverage enter your serial number and see if you've got AppleCare
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.180]   Wow, there it is. Yeah, no valid purchase date telephone support active
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.400]   apparently I didn't buy
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.920]   Single hardware repairs eligible for hardware repairs and service. Oh, there's limited warranty. It expires June 12th
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.400]   But I didn't buy AppleCare, but I could I get Apple? I could extend coverage now. So maybe I should
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.080]   Before just in case
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.360]   That's cool that you can just enter your serial number and it'll tell you what you got when you bought it and all that stuff
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   And it's not a cool thing
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.920]   Do you remember that the days when we would always recommend to somebody if you buy you're buying a MacBook or a powerbook?
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.280]   Yeah, buy the AppleCare. They're not built well. They will break very quickly, right?
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.800]   I think I I generally don't recommend these because I figure I'll self-insure
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.400]   These things are pretty reliable. It's got to be a profit center
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.080]   I don't know about Apple, but they're a lot more reliable than they were like five or ten years ago
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.760]   Now do they have AppleCare Plus? That's the question. There isn't that that's for the phones, right?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.080]   You can get a plus not for not for laptops and the plus protects you guys, you know like stupid things like
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:26.040]   Better against stupidity better against stupidity be 249 bucks to extend my coverage to three years. I
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.640]   Don't know if that's is that a good deal. What do you guys suggest? Is that a good deal?
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.600]   It is if I don't it's gonna something bad is gonna happen
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.160]   I just know that karmically that every time I've refused it
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.840]   It's exploded or been or been run over or something bad has happened. So now I just get a de facto
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.640]   What about you Andy? What do you recommend when people ask you say?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:52.080]   Well, there's the extended warranty and then there's AppleCare, which is you know apples version of Apple may not make money on AppleCare
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   I don't know
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.000]   It's not I think that if you're spending less than like 80 dollars a year on it and this
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.080]   Be you expect to get a few years of service out of this and see you are the sort of user who keeps moving this device around
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.480]   From room to room and particularly from like office to office
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.920]   Yeah, I think that I think it pays off it can pay off in the long run
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.120]   If you're the sort of person who's essentially using a MacBook as a replacement for your desktop
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.360]   There's not a whole lot that's gonna happen to your device if you if it spends
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.880]   Seven days out of every 10 to simply on your desk do enough them. So your advice is situational
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.920]   A situation again if you're if you're a daily traveler
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.840]   Yeah, that really adds if you're if you need 10 to acquire 10 points to convince you to do to buy the extended warranty
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:46.200]   Being someone who has to carry their their machine to and fro every single day. That's at least four to five points towards that argument
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:52.440]   I'm also like also the type of person where I make complete clumsy. Oh, so I look at it like Renee care plus
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.400]   No, absolutely
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.360]   I have dropped a brand new phone on the floor of the Apple store in front of the Apple store manager and he'll just look at me
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   Like you know, I'm standing right here
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.840]   So I know that it's gonna be bumped around and dropped and all that stuff
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.400]   So it's well worth it to me to protect against my defense against me basically
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.360]   So so it's less insurance and more like of an oath tax. Yes. I
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.240]   Wear that badge proudly sir. Oh
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:25.120]   Now here's somebody in the chatroom sent us from Ohio State the Ohio State University
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.480]   They I guess in law schools do this. I know Henry's college where he is now the famous Colorado University Colorado Boulder Andy
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Go buffs
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.920]   that
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   They offer I guess something called safe where a lot of colleges do this
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:49.080]   I know you see see you does and that is better than Apple care. It's longer. It covers accidental damage is probably a little more expensive, right?
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   but
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   Earthquake is not covered, but I don't think Ohio is really prone to earthquakes
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.920]   Cosmetic damage is not covered so don't spill your makeup on it
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.280]   You do have to worry about Buckeye damage though Buckeye damage, baby
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.360]   I got that letter from my insurance company a couple months ago where it said we're no longer protecting you against tsunami
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.680]   Responses by the US government to acts of terrorism. Ah well, that's the third one. They were trying to bury the lead
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.800]   That's the important one you want to call right back and say what what have you heard?
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.240]   Really if you're hit by a drone strike, you're out of luck. Yeah, yeah, okay
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.720]   Well, that's probably true anyway, I think it's been on long enough. I'll put the fire extinguisher away
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.440]   I never buy Apple care
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.800]   But again, I'm the wrong guy to ask because I this what this computer won't be on this desk in three years
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.280]   It won't be this desk in three months three months. Yeah
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:46.440]   It really it really I think the biggest factor like four four points in that ten point scale is
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:53.480]   What is your own personal experience with devices going bad on right and if you've had a if you've been buying Apple products
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.440]   Consistently and they've been breaking on you for the past five to eight years
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.080]   It's not due to the build quality of the device is probably due to the way you handle them or the people in your household handle
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.840]   And that's that's a good factor to say. Yeah, it's probably gonna be worth the money for me. I
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.680]   I had the same problem that you had the only the only problem I've ever had
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.720]   Mechanical problem I've had with any one of my Mac books in the past ten years was yes a beverage
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:21.920]   a slight beverage spill into the keyboard and even then all that happened was the trackpad like stop clicking and that was it and
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.640]   So one for me. It's just it's not worth the money. I'd rather spend that money
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   You know being more alert when I'm handling beverages or or switching to a better brand of like less caustic beverage
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   Something was not quite so much phosphoric acid in it. I have to say apples are like Volvo
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.360]   So I run these things into the ground. I I don't I can't think of a single Mac that I've broken
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.960]   Or a stop working, you know
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   I mean I hand them down the next you know to my kids or friends or whatever or a lot of our a lot of my Mac books
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:57.060]   End up with employees and they're all working pretty well as far as I know they're terrific values my
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.480]   my I'm I'm I'm I'm a is a
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.320]   2000
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:07.240]   Actually 2007 model I'm back and it's still running the lays version the operating system and it's not like I'm running
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.680]   You know final cut ten on it
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:15.520]   so it really still does the job for me and the only and the time when I replace it is probably going to be the time when
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.560]   I'm doing something on the desktop that requires more memory than the maximum amount of memory I can put in there
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.560]   Because these these things are really are built in last you can get a service you can easily expect to get a service life of five years out of a Mac
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.040]   I'm going on a three-week trip and I don't know who's hosting who's hosting the show when I'm gone. I don't know it'll be a September
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.760]   17th, I'll be gone through October 8th. Yeah, we have a we have a list a list of people and I'm sure Andy's one of them
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   Yep, I'm hosting we love it when you host
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:48.320]   But I'm trying to decide whether to bring my retina my last year's retina or to bring the air the air certainly a lot lighter
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.240]   But I like this screen on the retina and I'll be doing a lot of photography
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.560]   You know what I do is I bring two drives. I have a solid state drive 128 gig drive, which was the old
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:06.100]   Retinas old SSD upgraded and then I have another spinning drive and I you know back up twice with all my photos
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.680]   But having a good screen makes a difference. I don't know. I guess this is probably good enough for
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.040]   basic photo editing. I
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.160]   Love the right. I hope that you're I hope that you'll be spending more time taking more photos than working on the photos
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.360]   I know no no I show that's probably the reason why to take the air
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.280]   proactive yet you're right
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.600]   Proactively though
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.840]   I like to at least go through a few and upload some to smoke mug and stuff so that if something bad happens I
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.440]   At least have some of the pictures right? I that's that's the the the reason why my flicker feed tends to
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.400]   Contain like my greatest hits forever is because when I take a great shot
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   I'm traveling I'm in another country or whatever my first impulse when I see that on the back screen of my camera is that
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.440]   I got to I have to upload this to flicker right away even if I keep it private because yep
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.560]   I'm not going to necessarily have control of all of my computers for the rest of this trip and if my computer gets stolen
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.520]   I don't have that once in a lifetime photo
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.400]   I'm gonna be as bummed out as I am about losing
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.440]   $500 for the equipment I'm gonna be triple bummed that I that my one shot of looking stupid and in front of the great wall
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.520]   With China has has gone forever by the way. I want to correct a miss
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.580]   Apprehension big nut squirrel has in our chat room. Okay. I know that the first day of my departure is the day grand theft
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.560]   Auto five comes out, but that's a complete coincidence
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.080]   Complete coincidence. All right. We're gonna take a break when we come back big shift
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.040]   Maybe the biggest story. I think we're gonna look back
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.320]   It might say arguably the biggest story of 2013 the announcement that Steve bomber will no longer run Microsoft
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.480]   I know this is an Apple show
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:42.340]   But you cannot deny that the the fates of the two companies are intertwined that gates and jobs were the lead
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:47.680]   leaders of the tech industry for many decades bomber the successor Tim Cook across the aisle
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:57.100]   We'll talk a little bit about post a post Steve bomber Microsoft and about Ben Thompson's article if Steve bomber ran apple
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.460]   Which I thought is quite actually quite a provocative
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.660]   Article get your opinions just a second before we do that though
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.100]   Let's say hi to our good friends. It's my software smile. You should be smiling on my Mac remember that
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:16.540]   They just smile as they make you smile and they have a wonderful product which I use all the time just updated PDF pen
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.400]   The all-purpose Mac PDF editor now in version six they added
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:29.740]   Some great features you can export to Microsoft Word. That's new. They have a completely redesigned interface, which is gorgeous
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:36.380]   I love the fact that I can have a library of signatures and initials because when I'm doing caught people still
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.820]   So many contracts send me contracts with PDF and I could just use
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:47.340]   Signature stamp. It's awesome to sign the the documents. You can add text images and signatures
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:56.380]   With PDF pen you can even dig deep into the PDF is why it's really fantastic and fix typos resize and delete images make changes fill out forms
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:01.500]   It has ocr. I just think it's a fabulous product PDF pen

[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:22.220]   And if you decide to buy $60 it is a wonderful tool and I highly recommend it PDF pen
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:28.900]   Let me see. I should open a PDF and just show you the interface. I've been signing a lot of documents lately
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.460]   See if this one opens up. Yeah, there you go
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:42.420]   So it's I love the interface. They've done a great job of of giving you video tutorials doesn't our friend who does those video tutorials?
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.180]   Let me see. Yes, David smart. No, it's David Sparks. Yeah
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.380]   Does a great job on those yeah, Don. I think you stood. I don't know maybe Don does some too
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:23:01.060]   There's some good online help once you open the PDF you have complete and utter access to it and
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:07.580]   The library gives you a chance to put in shapes signatures all sorts of stuff
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.120]   They even have a lot I love this a library of proofreaders
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.460]   Diacritical marks so if you want to look like you actually blue pencil this thing
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:24.220]   To be Danny you're you're an insane wretch the people still use these
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:31.260]   No, I think I think I'm probably part of the last generation who knows what a lead is
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.980]   Yeah, who will arrogantly say no, I did not mean a an lea
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:43.820]   It is an led right but no I I would say do you end the fox trot off this cut shove back at me
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.140]   Do you end your articles with - 30 -
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:52.380]   No, it's three three pound signs and then 30 then three pound sign. I'm sorry pardon me
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.740]   Only only when only when I'm showing off normally. It's just basically I'm just I'm complete fan
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.260]   I'm completely out of ideas and now I'm really hungry for that burrito in my microwave feel goodbye
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.740]   What does the 30 mean I never knew that I?
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.640]   Don't know it's lost in there. I think I think it has to do with the line of type type setting it was
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.140]   Yeah, I
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.140]   Know it has some to do with the mechanical typesutters
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.860]   It's a funny thing you saved to ever note now you can save out as as
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:32.060]   Microsoft Word document. They've just got so many great features. I love a PDF pen pro version 6

[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:58.000]   Alright, well, you know, I know this is an Apple show and I think people are gonna get mad at me because I'm gonna bring this up
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.880]   But I do think it is a huge story
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.580]   Steve bomber announced last week
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:10.020]   That on Friday that he is calling it quits CEO of Microsoft for a long time
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.460]   13 years some 17 year long. I was a 2000 when did he step up?
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:22.260]   He did a lot of good for Microsoft. I think he doubled revenue tripled profits or is it the other way around?
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.860]   But the stock price which shouldn't really be a factor
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:32.540]   You know if you're doubling the profits of a company over your time of your tenure and everybody pointed to including me
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.060]   The fact that the stock price the valuation of the company went from
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:41.460]   600 million to 300 million under his tenure, but that's just the stock market
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.620]   No, pleasing them. Yeah, but I think it might have something to do
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.900]   Frankly with with Ballmer's departure
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:56.500]   I think he was kind of encouraged to leave the the smoking gun on that is Mary Joe Foley from our Windows Weekly Show interviewed him that day and
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:04.020]   She said to Bill try to get you to stay Bill Gates chairman of the board at Microsoft and his former Harvard roommate and
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.340]   Steve said oh, you know bill. This is a personal decision. Bill didn't didn't weigh in
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:18.780]   In the past in the past bill has staunchly defended his friend. I think there's that's a little telling
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.180]   Anything to say about it from an Apple point of view is there
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.660]   No, I mean that you you mentioned
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:34.580]   You mentioned that piece earlier that I think it's really techery. I'm sorry. Yeah that I thought hit every single important point
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:44.580]   The only in that the difference between the way that Apple is running the way that Microsoft has been run is that people at Apple are motivated to do great products and
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:52.500]   People at Microsoft. I think corporate as a corporate culture are motivated to do things that help that internal corporation
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   Thrive and survive so you really mo I think people inside Microsoft. They're very passionate about the things they do
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.820]   But ultimately in five five years from now what they're hoping to have accomplished is not to have created a great new product
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:11.580]   But to have made it to another step in the developmental ladder for their own careers, which is which sounds bad
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.700]   At the surface of it
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:19.340]   But I mean at some point you have to at some point you're you're kind of looking at your own path as opposed to the path of the stuff that you're working on
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.420]   And that's I think that's the way that Microsoft is pretty much motivated
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.220]   the only thing that I would add to it is that I
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:32.020]   Don't think that Microsoft gets enough credit for being really good at really boring things
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.020]   I mean we forget that
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.940]   Windows is still
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.580]   Absolutely with beyond a shadow of a doubt the dominant operating system on the planet and as much as we make fun
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.620]   Every single time they've updated windows
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.300]   We make fun of how horrible it is how clumsy it is and how everybody hates it
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:54.100]   But it still remains the operating system that more than 80% of the computers on this planet actually run and you can make fun of how
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.580]   God what an ungodly
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:04.740]   ghastly user of interface to design that that Microsoft has committed to and recommitted to an office putting more ribbons with more toolbars
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.740]   But office is still the dominant
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:14.420]   It is still the the grease that causes the gears of industry and business to continue to turn so and those
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.940]   Continue to be incredibly profitable businesses for them
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:24.140]   And everything that is not facing the user is also incredibly profitable for them. So it's
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:33.380]   When when when he announces resignation for some reason I put me in the mind of people complaining about how Jay Leno and David Letterman are not like the angry
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:38.980]   Dangerous inventive comedians that they were in 1970 1979 1982 1983
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.060]   You know when they first became big celebrities to a certain extent
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:51.500]   It's kind of silly for a 65 66 year old man to be the person who is trying to be the the 2013 version of Lenny Bruce
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:58.340]   Because at this point he's delivering a product that people count on and rely on and that he can count on he can rely on and the people
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   That who work for him can count on and rely on
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:08.140]   Microsoft I think is just in that stage of their development where it's really really difficult for them to with all the baggage that they have to
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:13.140]   Bring something to the table that has never really been done before or never been done successfully before
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:21.380]   They're at that stage and they're at that age where their job is to watch the iPhone become successful and watch the iPad become successful
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.780]   And let that guide them on to where they need to take all their software and their hardware in the future
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.660]   whether or not this is shooting themselves in the foot long term because
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:36.540]   We all know that the market for desktop PCs and laptops is shrinking as mobile devices are gaining more market share
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:43.460]   That remains to be seen but much like when people complain about you know Apple dropping the ball on maps or bruising a phone
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.660]   That's not quite as exciting as it should be they have enough
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:53.340]   They have enough coal in the bunker that they can keep the business going for a great number of years before they really have to
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:59.500]   have a successful strategy for that and the fact that they have a new CEO coming in and
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:07.020]   Not necessarily somebody who's been groomed from within the culture for the past five years to take up that role is a great thing
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.300]   If they can bring someone in from the outside who can effectively say that okay
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:17.580]   Here is exact who is here is exactly the path that we need to take and it doesn't involve having three different organizations with
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:25.180]   Interlocking arrows and circles and lines between them that could really be the thing that allows Microsoft to finally make that transition and in
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.360]   2015 2016 2017 make us all wonder
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:36.420]   Remember that time ten years ago when Microsoft was doomed and now they now they have 53% of the tablet market and they have
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.660]   38% of the phone market and
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.180]   Windows is still on four out of every five computers out there man goodness
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.060]   Wish I bought Microsoft stock back then instead of it's someone else's stock
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.980]   Yeah, I should point out that
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.900]   Bombers my age he ain't he's 65 year old comedian. He might have a few years left in an Andrew
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:01.020]   But I also thought what interesting was in this by the way
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.420]   Didn't Microsoft will start slate didn't they once own slate now?
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.180]   It's a Washington Post enterprises means Jeff Bezos
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:14.540]   Article and slate the poisonous employee ranking system that helps explain Microsoft's decline
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:20.020]   They're talking and they referred back to a vanity fair article of last year where they talk about stack ranking which
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:26.380]   Devorax talked about a couple of times on Twitter. It's just really kind of to outsiders and appalling way of
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.500]   choosing employees
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.300]   What happens is
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:38.460]   Every unit is forced to declare a certain percentage of employees as top performers a certain percentage is good performers
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.980]   average below average than poor and
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:46.320]   The poor performers out the door so it's it's it's a very Don Draper's
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.580]   Structure I mean that Microsoft really has a
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:56.660]   Microsoft has always had the opposite of the hippie sort of mentality that Apple has had and that's not that's certainly
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.780]   I'm not saying that is a good thing. It's brutal. It's really it really is its IBM. It's Raytheon
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:08.220]   It's these big corporate structures and that's why people job number one is to maintain your job for the next five years
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.300]   That's the problem even and I hope I didn't make it sound as though
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.060]   I think that people who work at Microsoft don't care about the products
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:20.900]   They do I speak I speak I know so many engineers who talk just as passionately about design and function as anybody
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.860]   I've ever meant at Apple, but the thing is that you can't really
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:31.140]   promote your ideas and your aesthetic if you are not there three years from now to be there to be that voice in that
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.540]   Development at the new product. So job one is always going to be make sure you have a job in two or three years
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.060]   The way that they run that company they called it
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.780]   Rankin yank
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.380]   and
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.380]   Last year so bad. I mean I
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:50.540]   Sure if that was handed to me at HR just to see what was inside like a Rankin yank, please no
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.900]   I don't think you that word does not mean what you think it means
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:58.020]   The Seattle Times interview bomber last month and asked him are you still doing stack ranking?
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:03.340]   He says I think everybody he said yes, I think everybody wants to work in a high performance culture
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:08.940]   Where we reward people who are doing fantastic work and get this we help people who are having a hard time
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.380]   Find something else to do
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.420]   I mean that was the problem
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:22.740]   The performance metric the problem with Microsoft is that they didn't they didn't react when things went wrong
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.820]   They just like stack ranking obviously didn't work and they double down on instead of switching it
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.380]   And a lot of people have said that bomber fail to see trends or fail to have Microsoft react
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:37.340]   But in truth they were ahead of a lot of the trends they had MSN when the internet was known for Google took over
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.160]   They had tablet PC before there was an iPad they had Windows
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.820]   Before there was an iPhone they just had an absolute inability to make a product that would attain mainstream penetration
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.460]   And maybe that's because they were enterprise focused but even then
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.860]   Google spun on a dime and made Android out it took it from a blackberry to an iPhone and no time flat
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:03.860]   Three or four years ago if Microsoft had put an X phone and X slate on the market running halo beautifully office beautifully exchange
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.260]   SharePoint all of that stuff fantastically well
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:11.780]   They would have had a killer product but not only did they not do that they were unable to see the things that they
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.060]   that old Chinese proverb they did not know what they did not know and
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.380]   I mean I'm talking to someone who I loved Microsoft
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:23.860]   I had all Microsoft for a long time and they just stopped making the products. I wanted and I desperately wanted that
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.380]   Bill Gates CES demo future technology stuff and they just never ever went back to it. Yeah
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:37.420]   Interesting quote. I would like to know if you agree with it. This is Johnny I speaking a year ago our goal at Apple obviously
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.940]   Isn't to make money
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.300]   Our goal absolutely at Apple is to not make money
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.500]   This may sound a little flippant
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.260]   But it's the truth our goal and once it gets us excited is to try and make great products
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   We trust if we're successful people will like them and if we are operationally competent
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.260]   We will make revenue, but we are very clear about our goal. Do you think you Microsoft?
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.860]   I don't think Microsoft could say the same thing in fact in bombers farewell is interview
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.300]   With Mary Jo Foley. He said I think I've done a very good job for our shareholders
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.100]   You know we made a lot of money
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.820]   That's a miss that's clearly a mistake to chase the money in fact. I think any good business
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:22.100]   Jeff Bezos would probably say the same thing. We don't look at how much money we want to make we look at how we could best serve the customer and trust
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.260]   That that won't do well for us in the long run. But do you think Apple is that way? I?
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:33.800]   Think well, I think the difference with Amazon is that they don't care about how much money they make they care about what sort of
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.380]   Business they can develop for themselves for five years now, right?
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:41.500]   So they are absolutely profoundly willing to eat it for three or four years if they are convinced that this will put them in a
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.340]   Great position for five years, but they are also customer focused are they not they?
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:52.620]   They're absolutely customer focused, but I don't but I think that Apple is more directly focused on if we make a great product that will engage the
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.620]   consumer that will that
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.420]   We we're we're not chasing the bucks today
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.540]   But the bucks will come to us if we pursue that kind of concept
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.980]   We're what they love and the money will follow and that was one of the parts of Ben Thompson's article
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.260]   I like so much when you pointed out that if you spend all your time
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:13.100]   Protecting and maximizing revenue streams you have no time left to invent new products
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:18.500]   So if you if you think your company is gonna die and you think that there's no innovation left and that it's the end of whatever business
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:24.460]   You do you can absolutely double down on profit and try to eke out every last bit you can from it
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.220]   But if you think you know technology is gonna continue beyond the next decade
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.820]   Then it seems like it's incumbent upon you to try to invent the decade after that and that's where it seems Microsoft kind of fell flat
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.260]   Yeah, I
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.580]   Think you know in my business in our business what I try to teach our
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.940]   You know new people new to the business is you know stop worrying about your hair or about what the audience thinks
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.940]   Start worrying about serving the audience and the rest will follow including profit
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.340]   Your job is to serve the customers to serve the audience and if you do that well
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.820]   You'll be rewarded another point that he that Ben makes in his article. He quotes a
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.900]   Piece written by John K
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.340]   Said that was titled sometimes the best a company can hope for is death
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.180]   There's a natural life cycle for businesses and
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.580]   I don't mean death necessarily go out of business
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:22.420]   I mean death to you know if you want to create events you want to create a advance or the question what business are we in and
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.540]   You need to reinvent yourself all the time
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:31.140]   Bob are clearly demonstrated that he was a steward not a creator that he was gonna you know he he took over a
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:37.140]   Thriving business and kind of kept it on the same track and when it came time to change tracks did not
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.660]   Yeah, one of the worst problems you can do is mistake your pro your business for your products
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.340]   And that's what I was good at they you know the Mac was not their business
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.780]   So they made iPods and they made iPhones then they made iPads and I'll make what's next but for bomber
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:55.580]   It looked like windows was his business and not just a product that he would do the next iteration or the next version of really
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.580]   It's true isn't it it was all about windows
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:03.740]   They said that's the mistake that the railroad moguls made they thought they were in the railroad business at the transportation business
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.740]   Yeah, well that's and the other problem is that
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   when you have a company that
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.380]   thinks of itself as a
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.700]   closed system and a zero-sum game where if
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:25.300]   In terms of inside Microsoft if you develop a great new product that will only take resources away from other products inside the company
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.140]   That are making lots of money and so that really doesn't lead to the thinking the same well
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.340]   We need to great this is a great idea. We should just plain pursue it
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.260]   I think that Apple Apple has always shown an ability to
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:43.940]   Absolutely shoot itself in the foot and kill create create a product that's gonna kill an existing product
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.100]   They already have in the movie jobs
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.220]   We saw that sometimes that's done out of spite when someone creates the Macintosh to kill them kill the Lisa
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:55.380]   But but in general though we've seen an ability to say I know this gonna make it difficult
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.260]   The fact that this iPad does so many things that are similar to the Macbook air means
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.980]   It's gonna make it a sort of a confusing it might make it a slightly confusing choice for people to see a
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.940]   $500 device that will do all the light computing stuff
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.180]   They might want to spend $1,300 for in the Macbook air
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.100]   But we don't care because this is a great product and we think it's gonna do great things
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:21.020]   They they killed the Apple - they killed their desktops their their desktop business by making great notebooks
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:30.140]   You have to you can't think of your company as the success of one division will only ever come at the expense and the death of another division
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:34.780]   You can only think that the success of any part of the company makes the entire company stronger
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.420]   And so everything I do has to be the best that it can possibly be
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.420]   It's amazing. We got an Xbox. It really is after the kin got killed and the courier got killed
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.300]   Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna talk about courier
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:53.460]   I mean that that really looks like it could have been an incredible device. It looked weird, but Google would have just made it
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.020]   Yes, they would they would have made 5,000 copies of it and put them out there
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:06.020]   And if you want to spend $1,500 for great here you go because we really want to see if people will actually use it the idea of a
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:12.500]   productivity a device is not necessarily not necessarily for consumption of media
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:19.980]   But it's also from for the transposition of ideas from some Naptic misfiring is up here to something you can actually put into
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:26.180]   Electrons and actually show people and interact with and work with that's a hell of an idea and they had so many
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:33.460]   interesting interface ideas with courier too, but and I would love to know the story behind the leaking of that
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:38.380]   Incredibly polished demonstration video. I wonder if it were either a
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:45.260]   Exactly that's it right there part of me thinks that it was an intentional leak from Microsoft just to say well
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.540]   We know we can't release this but we want to show you what kind of sauce we got going on creatively inside there
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:55.380]   But part of me wonders if somebody in that team seeing that there is only one chance of this product ever
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.860]   Taking one step forward at this company and that's for this video to come out and for people to say that's a great idea
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.140]   You should definitely be moving forward on that this in fact the name at the top of the
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:10.980]   Contextless like not just noted we had the last name allard. This was Jay Allard's last product at Microsoft
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.860]   We know now this wasn't we thought at the time
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.260]   Maybe it was just a concept video
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.780]   But we know now that they were in fact developing a product which was killed Jay Allard left almost immediately afterwards
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.140]   He was one of the visionaries he created Xbox
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:29.820]   There wasn't a good creative environment for people like him and some people are even raising his name as a potential
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.380]   Replacement for Palmer, you know another name that's coming up. It's got forced all
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.300]   Brother works there
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.060]   Well, I'm not sure why you consider that except that he can kick ass right? He's not exactly a
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.300]   Guy who makes friends, but he could go in there and
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:52.980]   Do maybe something that needs to be done, which is pull some weeds? Well, they can they can go to I would hate to think about
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.340]   One of the most beautiful user interfaces I've ever seen for mobile
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:02.260]   Which is the Metro interface on both phones and tablets and him thinking there is a lot of black space
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:10.380]   How about some natural some astroturf behind there the email app and okay, I guess Scott's out
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.020]   And some fresh-step crystals behind the web browser
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.420]   That's not a bad idea
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.020]   All right, we're gonna take a break apples on another and on acquisition spree last week was matcha

[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:14.100]   So wasn't it last week that Apple bought the matcha which was a recommendation engine or something like that for video?
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:20.580]   This week they bought another mapping app mbark e mba rk
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:25.140]   They build free transit apps. This is something Google's done so well with Google Maps is
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.260]   transit directions
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:33.580]   It's not a big team and it could just be one of those acquire things aqua hire
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.780]   Things but they've been around for a couple of years. They build apps for Android and iOS
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:44.100]   About half a dozen cities the transit maps from New York San Francisco and Chicago. I haven't used them
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:50.260]   Apple said we do not discuss our purpose or plans
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.820]   So you just have to guess what they're doing. I think they're smart
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.140]   I think Apple needs to continue to beef up maps maps gotten better and we'll continue to get better
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.100]   They didn't buy ways that might have been a mistake Google got them
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.420]   Anything to say about embark
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.780]   It's they released map maps was a huge project for them
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.500]   It sucked out a lot of the time they had to put into iOS 6 and they couldn't do everything
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:22.060]   So transit was one of the most glaring omissions when the maps app came out and they sort of punted on that and let third parties
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:29.980]   Fill in the gaps and it's an incredibly hard thing to do because every look every locality sometimes every transit authority in a locality
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:37.460]   Has different formats and different regulations and you have to make deals with all of them and sometimes they'll share and sometimes they won't and it's incredibly onerous and time-consuming
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.100]   And they just couldn't do it and now
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.620]   They're maturing their map product. They're building out their geo team and it looks like they're finally
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.260]   Finally is the wrong word
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.060]   But they now have the ability to go out and start looking at these features
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.980]   And considering these features and maybe they're buying these companies because they have deals in place with a lot of the places that
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:01.500]   Apple's gonna need to collect data from to do transit, but hopefully it means sooner rather than later that little towel
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   Light up and we'll be able to get bus and metro and train in subway directions. Yeah
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:12.780]   Last month or actually was yeah, it was last month the judge of course ruled against Apple in the ebooks
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:20.500]   Case the Department of Justice amended its remedy its punishment if you will on Friday
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.420]   following a hearing earlier this month
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.540]   quoting a Steve Jobs email in
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:35.260]   Which Steve said let's force them to use our far force them is the keyword here to use our far superior
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:45.660]   Payment system he wanted to retest quote retaliate against Amazon for competitive conduct that Apple disproved of that's the DOJ speaking
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.540]   So as a result
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.420]   They want not only
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:48:00.460]   To let Amazon sell stuff directly right that's part of the punishment. I mean let me let me read the whole thing
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.340]   They want to change how the app store sells content basically
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:10.140]   All kinds of digital content just not not just ebooks it wants Apple to
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:18.500]   Abandon any agreements that would increase fix or set the price at which ebook retailers or retailers of other forms of content can acquire or sell ebooks
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.780]   or other forms of content they want Apple to
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.580]   let the let the
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:30.420]   Increase fixer set the price this includes music audio television or apps
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:36.580]   You want to get rid of the most favored nation clause which meant that everyone like Amazon
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.340]   That the people who are selling stuff couldn't let anyone out for a higher price
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:40.980]   Got it
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.300]   Because the fear was that they would increase it by 30% in the app store to make up for what Apple charged them
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   And then no one would buy on the app store got it
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:54.860]   Apple says protested it reasonably leads to concerns regarding what Apple is doing and plans to do in those other content markets like music
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:00.020]   Television not a good time for that to happen Apple's trying to negotiate deals with TV right now
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:07.180]   The DOJ also wants Apple to negotiate with publishers at staggered times rather than all at once
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.340]   So that I guess so it there can't be any collusion expedating
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.620]   she's
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:19.000]   So they've actually said in the proposal. They said a timetable for when Apple could renegotiate its contracts
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.620]   Which is wild?
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:30.260]   They also want an external monitor rather than the vigorous in-house antitrust enforcement program the judge suggested
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:35.820]   They want somebody outside the DOJ did that with Microsoft remember after their lawsuit against them
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:42.460]   They want more than just in-house enforcement, so they're going they're going for the jugular on this one
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.900]   Yeah, I wonder what point
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:49.460]   Is there still room for Apple to negotiate a settlement?
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:54.820]   That's a little bit more toward their liking rather than simply accept these terms and keep fighting and fighting and fighting it
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:50:00.580]   I wonder how how how aggressively the Department of Justice wants this solution as opposed to simply wanting to
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.420]   Inflict some sort of control over the way Apple does handles that business
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:11.260]   I do have I'm I am 78% eager into the legal stuff that's that's associated with this
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:16.580]   But I have to say that I really really hope that Apple finds some way to accommodate in app purchases
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:22.500]   Without sending have to send people out to a website to actually complete a transaction inside a book reader app
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.700]   Yeah, it's just it's just it's nuts. It's very very
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:33.420]   It's it's one of those rare times when you really want when you when you have the keynote event where they talk about how they're all
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:37.780]   Customer focused and they're all about improving the experience for our customers. We'll say
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:44.820]   But why do I have to leave the Kindle app in order to buy a book and then come back to the Kindle app and re-sync and it's like
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.740]   Yeah, and the reasons why they do that is exactly as you say and they make logical sense
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:54.900]   But it really is a bad thing for for customers and I just hope there's a way to figure out how to make that work better
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:59.900]   One of the big problems is that with the way the app store is built Apple takes 30% off of
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:07.540]   Sales and the original fear with the stuff like subscription and in-app consumable purchase was that everyone would just put everything to free
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.740]   And then charge you outside the app so Amazon would make everything free
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:18.540]   Charged outside the app game developers app developers and all of a sudden Apple would be hosting and providing credit card services and delivering everything
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:24.780]   Entirely for a set of free apps because it would be so simple to go to move all commerce outside their borders
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.180]   So to kind of protect that they included all of this in that 30%
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:33.380]   And the problem is that if you have a middleman business like Amazon or Netflix where you broke your content
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:40.260]   That's all you make is that 30% so it reduced the value of their business to nothing and maybe in the universe that Apple lives in
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.340]   They would rather be the middleman and not have to deal with Netflix or Amazon
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.540]   But that's probably not a sustainable model
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:53.220]   So you get into all these areas of trouble where you have to go out and it becomes impossible for Apple to maintain a possible for Amazon to maintain
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:59.620]   The interesting thing though is that if you've ever dealt with Amazon as an author or publisher originally or now as an app developer
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:05.060]   For example in the Amazon app store they make Apple look like hippies. They'll rewrite your app description
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.020]   They will change your price on you. They will give away your app for free
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.700]   if they decide to and that
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:16.500]   It's hard to to phrase this in a way that makes most people understand the traditional practices of publishing
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.460]   But the theory the DOJ wants is that you know Amazon should be able to sell it at a lower price if they want
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:24.220]   And people think that's great. I get a lower price
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:29.260]   But it makes you wonder about the sustainability of their business. Oh, yeah, and then the next thing is a DOJ suing
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.820]   Amazon for dumping
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.820]   Yeah, you know, they're not doing that yet
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:38.060]   Like imagine I mentioned Leo like or Andy and I if suddenly our publishers could say yes
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.380]   We'll pay you whatever we want for that article. That's a freebie. Thanks. Yeah
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:48.580]   Publishers really wanted the right to set the price of their books that was their main thing right and Apple was doing that right?
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.380]   That was the whole point of the agency model. We'll take 30% you charge whatever you want
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:57.140]   But this MFN clause its most favored nation clause was the real problem the sticking point
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:02.380]   Which was and you can't have a lower price anywhere else Apple should have computer on experience said yes
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.180]   We're taking 30% but we'll provide such a fantastic experience that some customers will be happy to buy an iBooks anyway
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.420]   Now somebody in the chatroom said well, how does this?
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.020]   How is this consonant with with Johnny? I've said we're not in it for the money
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:18.580]   It sure sounds like they are but I think you can even with this argue that it was about customer experience more than anything else, right?
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:24.580]   I think in the larger sense that they can't have a they can't create a store that they then have to close down a year and a half
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.940]   from now and that's that's how you provide customer service by
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.660]   Keeping your store in business. I
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:35.780]   Do think that there's a middle ground that could be found between these these various companies
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.860]   I don't think this is the this the only thing that's the that's that's possible
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:46.740]   I think that Apple now that the now that the iBook store the iTunes store is very much on its feet and has proven track record of
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:53.340]   Not just hosting content but delivering people with credit card numbers who want to buy content to that content
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.700]   I think they now have the ability to say well fine
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:01.500]   Do you want us to make it harder for those people to do you want do you want to make the flow of money from those customers to your?
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.260]   to your creators more difficult or easier we can make it easier for you and
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:11.420]   Just give us a little bit something so that we can all make money together and just make sure this
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:15.260]   Let's find an agreement so that we don't have to hand you the night you'll use the slit of throats with
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:18.820]   Speaking of flow. I've been watching this video behind you
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:21.540]   And it isn't a loop is it live?
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.500]   No, it's a five-minute loop
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:32.100]   It is it is a fish ladder at over the Charles River. I love it. Is that with the 10 20? What did you take that with?
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:36.020]   No, that's actually with the Moto X. You're kidding
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:43.580]   That's that's of course. We're not seeing full quality and maybe but it looks pretty good. It is it is 10 it is 1080
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.780]   It's it's it's framerates actually really really frickin good
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:52.900]   I have had it bolted to the to the to the railing so that was actually kind of like it's a nice static shot
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:58.460]   I just love that the compression is good. Yeah, it's it's one of my standard like sort of I
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:04.980]   Cannot I cannot maintain even 10 cents worth of interest in doing lots of video tests
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:10.420]   Oh, like phones and cameras, but at some point if I have time I will go to this place and just shoot like a
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:15.540]   Shoot some video just to see okay. Does it look good? Is the color okay?
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.260]   And this time I decided oh, I'll just let this roll for a while
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:23.580]   I don't talk much about video in any of these things, but they're all doing very credible video now
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:28.560]   And there is no two is good with no three is gonna be 4k right in the next Sony no
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.860]   Jiminy
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.300]   4k in a phone
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:40.580]   Yeah, but they're all doing very good 1080 HD full HD video with high frame rates
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:45.260]   In fact, there's so much to spare a lot of these phones do 60 frames or higher
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:49.940]   Slow mo this was actually this is not the right this is not the right video
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.700]   But I also shot another five minutes of this at 60 frames per second
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.860]   It's just great. I'm wondering if
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.140]   I'm wondering if
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:06.820]   We know anything about iPhone 5s is it what anything about the video in there? Are they gonna update that in any way?
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.420]   Think it'll get the frame rate
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:17.020]   Yeah, yeah, 60 frames is good. It really really makes a difference second 10 AP 60 is gorgeous
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.940]   It'll certainly get whatever benefits that the rest of the camera system gets from the provisional processing
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:28.900]   So you can you can hopefully get better better shadows pulled out of detail better details pull out of shadows better little light performance
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:34.740]   You're right that Apple has never really put high marquee new features into the video
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:41.860]   Apart from making that number from 720 to a higher number and now increasing the number representing frame rate to a higher number
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.660]   But they've never you you realize that in all the demonstrations. They've given of new phones
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.580]   I don't think they've ever included a demonstration of how good the video is
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:56.060]   They've shown how good iMovie is and they've shown how good the publishing tools are but they've never said
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:01.340]   I want you to see how good this is a shooting video. Here is a birthday party look how it's
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:07.260]   I'll totally illuminated by the birthday candles didn't have to have any extra lights and you can see the smile and everybody's faces
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:12.380]   Of course if they're shooting at 4k you can get like what five syllables of happy birthday before it fills up
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:21.740]   I hope I'm oversampling for why 4k on the phone well, we'll find out September 4th
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:27.180]   We'll be covering that Samsung announcement. They also supposedly Samsung is announcing a watch like the vice
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:34.060]   We don't know for sure, but that's that's the rumor, but is anybody excited about this? No
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.180]   Not exactly because we know that they're
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:40.780]   I could be eating my own words in a month from now
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:45.980]   But what I'm expecting from Samsung is that they have the wherewithal to build a watch and so they're building a watch
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.460]   And it will have a decent number of features
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.860]   But nothing that will get you excited enough to spend
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.900]   $250 for it or to rethink how
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:59.580]   Rethink what your relationship is between you and the data that's on your device and and mobile internet
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.780]   So that's that's the cost of being Samsung
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:10.220]   They will build anything to satisfy anybody but there that means that there's it's it's sort of like if there's a movie series where there's three
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.980]   Installments of this movie every single year. Nothing seems as though it's important
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:19.260]   They're just throwing the next thing against the wall and by the time that start peels up from the wall and stand slaps to the floor
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:21.340]   There's gonna be another thing fired at that wall. So
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:26.300]   My prejudice tells me it's going to be Steve bomber standing on the CES stage with an HP slate all over it
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:31.900]   And you know this is just shows the power apple still has the power in some ways
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:36.300]   Because the reason we can say all that is because we're waiting for an eye watch
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:40.780]   Right even though it's 2014 we know there's no way it's this year
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.940]   Everybody's gonna say well what that's nice Samsung, but what let's see what apple does
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.260]   right
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.660]   I'm there there are a lot of companies. They're sort of poised here apple is one of them
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:57.980]   Uh google is another one of them. They both have both these companies have interesting ideas on taking information
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.340]   That's relevant relevant to you when you don't want to be staring at a phone
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:04.460]   Uh and putting it in a in a form that you can actually use it
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:08.700]   So as usual, I expect that apple would apple is going to come out with something that's
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:15.820]   Brilliant but limited google is going to come out with something that is equally brilliant but not as focused
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:21.500]   And as as usual, I want these two companies to get together and make a baby that I can then strap on my wrist
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:28.220]   Renegade investor carl icon is added again tweeted last week spoke to tim
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:35.100]   Sky is just evil. I you know, this is the worst kind of name dropping spoke to tim
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:40.780]   Planning dinner in september tim believes in buyback. He doesn't at no point is he say cook
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.540]   Is he has tim allen?
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:44.540]   Tim he
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:52.140]   Tim believes in buyback and is doing one what will be discussed is magnitude. I am carl icon
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:58.220]   Um carl did apparently buy a billion dollars worth of apple
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:04.460]   Uh, but his whole interest has nothing to do with watches tv's computers phones or anything in between
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.180]   It's all about how much stock you go buyback
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.700]   And uh, if you buy a billion dollars worth of something and you could talk him to do a buyback
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:17.820]   You're going to make a few hundred million dollars. I don't blame him. I I I tweet things like this too
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.540]   spoke to tim
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:26.700]   Unbelievable tim hortons. This is about like in timpets and a crawler
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.300]   Yes, he assumes everybody knows what tim he's talking about
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:34.380]   Oh, he moved the stock. I mean, yeah, but not but this one did not
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.300]   I guess it was all in now anybody who was really interested
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.220]   Has bought the apple stock. It's funny apple. It makes a lot of innovative products
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:48.940]   Their stock goes nowhere. Microsoft milks all the money out of their products their stock goes nowhere flat. Yeah carl icon tweets
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:53.180]   There's an invest in tweets
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:58.140]   tim cook leads a quiet revolution article uh by um
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:03.340]   Reuters by uh, poor mina poor nima goopta and peter henderson
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   talks about the culture
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.220]   the culture that tim cook is instilling at apple
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.340]   Which is kind of kind of interesting
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.500]   um
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   Two years into cooks tenure
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.260]   Um, this is it what wasn't the anniversary like this week
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.580]   He's been running it for two years now
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.780]   He's a nice guy
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.660]   He's not play as well with him. He plays with him with others. He works hard
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:39.580]   He turns his library books on time people who know him. Well the article says point painted portrait of a thoughtful
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.500]   sort
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.620]   I believe they said the word thoughtful, but I pronounced it thoughtful
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:48.140]   Data driven it's because i'm eating this jersey fudge. That's what happens
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:54.220]   A thoughtful data driven executive who knows how to listen and who could be charming and funny in a small group setting
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.060]   You know, I couldn't care less really about his personal skills
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:02.620]   In fact, that seems bad to me. She's painting a picture for you leo
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.900]   Yeah, no, what i'm saying. I don't know. Is that a good thing? I don't know
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   I this is this is the sort of fun that we can engage in because we are fans of apple and we like talking about this culture
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:20.620]   I'm always really curious about corporate cultures where at some point there is a legacy of fear in place, right?
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.300]   Where I don't I some it can work in some places
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:32.140]   I just wonder what ideas never got brought up because somebody did not want to be the jerk who spoke up and stood up to whoever it was
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.380]   Who isn't in a spitting rampage about whatever and knowing that well
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.980]   He's he or she is is really angry and shouting today
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.940]   But two weeks from now, let's just wait this out because he or she may change their mind and say something totally else
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:52.300]   So apparently not the micromanager steve was that's not tim's style at all. No more bi-monthly iPhone software meetings
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:58.780]   Still they write he has a tough side in meetings cook is so calm as to be nearly unreadable
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:04.780]   Sitting silently with hands clasped in front of himself any one heard white cat
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:13.820]   Mr. Bibbles or would any change in the constant rocking of his chair is one sign that subordinates look for when he simply listens
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.340]   So
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.220]   I maybe I take that back maybe the fear comes from the from the the chair and not from the person
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:29.820]   Fucking I don't know because have you ever been in that situation like when you're a kid with your parents where you're like oh
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:35.500]   Mom is talking very calmly right now. I wish he just hit me because this is even worse
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:42.380]   He could skewer you with a sentence one person said he would say something along the lines of
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:48.140]   I don't think that's good enough and that would be the end of it and you would just want to crawl into a hole and die
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.940]   I don't know. I sense this is how I wear it kill. Yeah
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:59.660]   It does sounds like you know, you used dew in terminology that Steve jobs was more of a penny geserit
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:06.060]   And Tim Cook was more of a mentat, you know, he's very data focused on numbers Tim Cook the mentat. Yeah, does he have purple lips?
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:10.460]   Um, what do the movie or the book?
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:15.820]   As the movie was terrible. It's the only movie as a kid I ever walked out on
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.900]   Oh, it was I remember I walked out of that movie and walked into Tron
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.180]   So maybe it's sort of a lateral Wow at least Tron had better effects
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:30.540]   I'm just I'm just reading it's this is read reads like one of those time magazine articles where they
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.700]   Act as if they were there in the room, but they're not it's a little daft because it has a bunch of apple
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.580]   Is doom stuff in the beginning in the end? It was kind of seemed really out of place
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:44.140]   And aren't we I mean at this point if we want to know what kind of culture the new ceo is creating
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.460]   We have a couple of years worth of data now. We don't have to like guess and worry
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:55.020]   We have to say he has has apple created a bunch of really nice products. Yes. They have had been successful hell. Yeah, they have
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:59.740]   All right. Yeah, but you could say that about Steve bomber too. I mean the question is coasting or innovating right
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:05.420]   Uh, we haven't seen the innovation yet. I'm hoping to this I don't know the
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:10.300]   Isla the iPhone five and the things they did to make that phone work are pretty damn innovative
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:15.580]   Yeah, but that you could argue was the last iowa Steve jioff's iowa seven is a huge deal. There you go
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:21.500]   That's not there you go. There's nothing trivial about that. I mean there's and there's nothing microsofty about how that that's not a good example
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:27.340]   They are lighting a fire to use to the user experience that people have been building up all the all the equity of user experience
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.740]   They've been building for the past five years to say we are going to confuse the hell out of you
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:38.380]   Uh in september and we're going to be doing this at a time when there are so many great android phones out there running a
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:44.140]   Fantastic version of the android operating system leading you perhaps to wonder if i'm going to have to relearn a lot of the things that i
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.820]   Used to know how to do on my iphone
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.780]   Why not relearn it on a phone that has a larger screen or something another feature that i like i guess the biggest change
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.900]   And this is kind of the same change you saw at microsoft from gates to bomber
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.700]   Was to go from the engineer the technical guy
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:04.700]   To the business guy right and and and seve jobs whether he was technical or not was very involved in the technical details of it
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.860]   All right, uh and cook seems to be more of a business guy an operations guy
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:15.180]   What was that article i forget which one but there was uh, sarrell sambre i think from facebook called tim cook for advice on how to be a number
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.940]   Two and he said you know i do the stuff that steve isn't good at or just doesn't want to do
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:25.180]   And now you know tim cook is the number one guy so they'll be number two guy and whether it's phil shiller or johnny ive or somebody else
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.020]   Who does this stuff that tim cook is not good at or doesn't want to do so you have these
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.820]   Complimentary personalities and they don't it doesn't have to be always the same type of guy on the top
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.900]   No, and in fact i think that that's what happens
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.340]   In any good business that uh, especially if the business is run by the founder
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.900]   Is that you have to have a number two?
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:46.860]   Or a partner who is gonna do the stuff you're not good at whether we wanted to do it or not
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:50.780]   There's a famous story. I forget who said it, but they were watching the ipad
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.540]   Be announced and they said you know how did you guys make that and they said steve and they go?
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.100]   Well, how did you make it so cheaply and they said tim?
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.380]   Ah
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.580]   There you go
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.420]   Well and credit
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.300]   To tim for delegating because i think you could say that ios 7 is the johnny ive product, right?
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.660]   very much so
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.660]   Yeah, it's a gutsy new take on interfaces
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:17.100]   Um in a very mass market product, which is not something every company is brave enough to do like and you said
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.740]   Well, you realize how mass market it is. I was watching the
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.500]   The video music awards the mtv music awards
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.300]   iPhones everywhere
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.980]   almost exclusively
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.980]   It has really become the
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:36.860]   I don't know if it's stan symbol or just the it's just the go-to phone for a huge swass of people
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:46.220]   Yes, though you can't I was uh, I had a great time last thursday. I there was a the uh, the
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:53.020]   The corneto trilogy that the shawn of the dead hot fuzz and then world's i was playing as a triple feature down
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.580]   And so as as I always do whenever i'm in a crowd of people
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.380]   i'm always sort of peeking at what phones people are using
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:06.140]   And I will tell I will say that not only was that a predominantly iphone crowd, but also
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:13.580]   I have never seen so many installations of ios 7 in one place before in my life, which also impressed me
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.660]   But this was not necessarily a typical
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:20.140]   Typical sampling a sampling of people with a lot of class and culture
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.660]   Definitely
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.860]   Uh, but that it is interesting that you see them so many in so many of the
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.180]   iPhones in that specific sort of the setting including like the vma awards
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.260]   And yet when you go on the subway when you go to like a street fair
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.020]   Yeah, a lot of antarctic
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.780]   Really well, not just a lot of android. I think that the the iphone is certainly
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:44.060]   You see you see a percentage of iphone this consistent with the fact that the iphone is made by one company
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.500]   And android is made by at least six major companies or excuse me
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.620]   Four or five major companies although I have to say microsoft windows phone was a huge advertiser on the vma's
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:59.500]   So they're talking windows phone. You don't see anybody using windows phone. Well again. That's see that was another interesting thing where
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.900]   I was at the again
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:08.380]   You talk about demographics and maybe this will be used a useful data point that microsoft can use at boston comic con
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:16.300]   Which it tracks like 45 50 000 people a few weeks ago. I was seeing an unusual number of noki alumia windows
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:22.540]   Interesting really and and they're distinctive they you cannot mistake them for anything other than a windows phone
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.260]   Both the 920 the 925 928
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:31.820]   Uh and the new 10 20s and I was seeing them not not not as certainly not as frequently as an iphone or an android phone
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:37.980]   But that was the first time where I was really palpably aware that I was in a community of people that were using lots of these phones
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:42.540]   So I tucked that one away because isn't that interesting that their message is getting through to
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:51.820]   That's where you want the super analyst screen. Do you really want the colors or the the colors on on Wonder Woman's tiara to really pop?
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:57.260]   Well, okay, so you said that sharl sandberg does the things mark zuckerberg doesn't want to do
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:01.740]   You said that tim cook did the things that steve jobs didn't want to do if you're wondering
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:06.540]   What is what did steve balmer do that bill gates didn't want to do watch this
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.580]   By the way, I believe in the winners and losers and especially the freedom to fail
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:46.140]   I must be from a microsoft sales conference
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.820]   Steve jobs they got him into the Ghostbusters rig once and then he stopped being cool forever
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.300]   Thank you big jins for passing along
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.660]   developers
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.180]   Uh, you know, I wish they they they they bury these and someday
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:11.740]   I hope that they will release all of the videos microsoft and bill gates made for the various ces's in the
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.860]   And the sales meetings because they did a lot of creative
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:21.100]   Great funny stuff and then there was a sign of felt stuff and then there was churros
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:25.980]   But but even that would be I would buy the dvd of all of that
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:32.060]   They can't because of rights or whatever, but I just also you should also look for a series of training videos that
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.900]   uh
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.620]   That ricketer vase and and uh, steven merchant did for microsoft. I think was for windows
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.180]   Seven or one root waste of of uh, it was david brent
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.700]   Essentially as a sales consultant like essentially
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:53.020]   Training people giving his opinion on what microsoft should be doing and with every third question asking if microsoft was hiring
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.980]   Here you go. Here you go
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:01.980]   Better better than each one of these was better than four episodes of extras. This is uh, this is uh, let me go back to the beginning of this
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:04.380]   Is called the office values?
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.020]   Thanks
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:15.900]   It's not unusual for us to invite down somebody who has built a reputation either in business or in industry and just ask anything I need
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.300]   introduction
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.300]   I think i probably should give you an introduction anyway
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:24.460]   Yeah, we're lucky to have with us today. It's on youtube watch it. They're in fact
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:29.340]   There's a whole series of them believe it or not. Uh, this was in between jobs probably
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.580]   One one would hope anyway
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:39.740]   Bruce brinstein sales go for the sales team an internal video with bruce brinstein about selling vista
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.700]   I mean they didn't they went all out on those things. They spent a lot of money
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.540]   I mean, it's really amazing some of the microsoft stuff. I've seen
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.980]   He used to show him a complex and ces but because of rights they could never release it in fact
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:57.180]   They would cut it out of the uh, uh, keynotes a lot of the times. I wouldn't you'd have to be there to see it
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.020]   uh, any other stories before we go to our uh
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:08.300]   Picks of the week the i7 claton morris or a7. I should say clinton morris tweets only 31
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:14.060]   Percent faster clinton's usually pretty good on these he's saying bent smarks are not showing a big speed increase
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:18.140]   95 mac agreeing is that what your uh, sources are telling you rene ritchie
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.260]   Uh, I heard very similar to clinton. I heard that it's not about
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:21.980]   I mean
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.580]   Previously the 3gs was twice as fast and then we had the gpu's that were faster
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:31.020]   And I heard the focus wasn't as much on speed but on being more efficient and more advanced and that probably translates
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.420]   like uh has well and um
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:38.940]   Mavericks into battery life because when you start adding more amazing features you've got to compensate with battery life
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:45.580]   For the phone doesn't last so I wouldn't be surprised if it had you know, it's the next generation swift core because apple's doing their own silicon now
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.980]   Is that a much better image image signal processor because like andia said many weeks now
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:56.220]   That's really the magic of their camera and then maybe if they go to rok, which is the next generation power vr graphics chip
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.900]   Um, you'll get a lot of the type of performance that apple will need for a device like the iphone
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.540]   uh 5s
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.660]   64 bit. I don't know about because that's taking bigger bites and i'm not sure
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:13.340]   How much that benefits them compared to the other stuff they could do maybe 64 bit graphics
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:17.260]   I'm not sure on a desktop that let you open really big photoshop files and edit
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:21.100]   It adds gives you more ram, but these phones they don't they have a couple of gigs at best
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.060]   Yeah, and I don't know if you need to take bigger bites out of stuff on the phone
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:30.140]   And maybe it's 64 bit for the gpu. I'm not sure but again the only thing I heard is that more advanced more efficient
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.220]   Uh, and maybe they'll go rogue with the gpu, which would be interesting and
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.900]   Um, the thing Andy talks about a lot, which is the image signal processor
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:43.260]   Clayton also said that there was a companion motion tracking uh core, which I haven't heard but sounds very interesting
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:49.500]   And uh a new slow motion mode capturing 120 frames per second. So that's the answer that video question
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.220]   Um, we'll see we're gonna see soon
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.180]   Anybody get an invitation?
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:00.700]   Not yet. I don't believe anybody's got invitations. Yeah, there was some talk on twit that perhaps
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:05.740]   Apple for the first time with these invitations would require you not to tell any when you got an invitation
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.100]   I don't see how they could do that
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.740]   That would be highly unprecedented and uh nda you on the
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:18.380]   Well, I guess they would say well, we don't want the date to come out. So we're gonna give you an invitation
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.220]   But you cannot tell anybody
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:24.300]   Every second reporter on twitter is booking airfare, but you're not. Yeah, I know it seems like
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:30.060]   It's both it seems both like something apple would do and a completely hopeless case
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:37.900]   There are there are times if you there are types of meetings that you have with apple that you are told that this is completely off the record
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:43.660]   This meeting never happened. Yeah, but inviting 600 people to your abuela center is has never been one of those things
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.860]   That's 600 people. They're really really certain of right
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:53.180]   Well, and frankly, that's why they wait to the week before they know it's gonna leak out
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.940]   So they don't tell you until which reeks havoc on airfare
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.500]   Did you have you booked tickets Andy?
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.660]   Uh, yes, so I will definitely be there
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:09.500]   Whatever happens. I will definitely be there for for I have I have emailed some context at apple saying that gosh
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:15.340]   I've for no for no reason whatsoever. I'm taking it. I'm just sad to spontaneously be in san francisco this week
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:19.820]   Hope I get to see while i'm there whether it's coffee coffee and at the
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:25.980]   At the mothership or someplace more centrally located. Do they send you a little smiley face in the response?
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:31.820]   I cannot complain a little. I cannot say does this smiley face have a once it's yes if you don't answer twice
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.460]   It's no here's the key colon or semicolon
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.740]   That's the key
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.820]   Well
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:44.860]   Already we have we we spend like 12 minutes talking about tim cooks management style based on hearsay
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.860]   We can we can say
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:53.420]   But it's it's a first initial period last name in this email address not first initial hyphen last name
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.820]   95 mac also sis apple will launch an iphone trade-in program
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:03.100]   As soon as next month. I maybe somehow tied to the release of new iphone
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.660]   Renee, do you think we're gonna get that iphone how quickly after september 10th
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:14.060]   Everybody's saying soon right quick. Yeah. Well. I mean if they stick to their previous pattern where they've done for the last couple of years
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:22.460]   They moved to the fall in 2011 and you know 2012 both years they announced the phone and then the next uh thursday the
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:27.820]   The gold sorry the general release of the os came out and then the friday after that the phone did
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:31.420]   So if that same pattern applies this year the event will be on the 10th
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:35.020]   iOS 7 will come out on the 18th and the phone will come out on the 20th
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.620]   being
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.700]   Being in italy by that time. So I won't be able to bring it with me. I want the gold one
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.820]   Unlocked gold to tell you an iphone. That's what you want. Isn't it?
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.980]   Come on
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.620]   I'm gonna have a relative who works for crylon
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.820]   Get some rattle cans kill set you'll hook you up
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:54.540]   apple releases developer preview number
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.180]   six for mavericks
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:02.620]   Um, so we're getting I would imagine that also is getting pretty close to
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.540]   Uh, that was a week ago. So I imagine we're getting pretty close to that as well. Do you think that'll come out with
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.500]   in october with new hardware
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:18.220]   That usually comes out either the day after an apple earnings call or to coincide with the launch of a new mac
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:23.980]   We know the mac pro depends on it. Yeah, we know the new mac pro is coming out any have you seen the
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:30.540]   Anybody seen the the trailer in the movies? I have oh yeah, it's just like the one they showed at the
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.100]   WWDC, right?
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.460]   I think i'm not sure if exactly because apple uploaded it again
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.140]   So i'm not sure if it's exactly frame for fran's name, but the effect is almost identical. Yeah
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:47.500]   It's good though. If you were seeing this uh here here's the trailer from cnet if you were seeing this in a movie theater, it would look pretty
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:53.020]   Uh pretty exciting. You might even think oh good. There's a new, you know, uh
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.780]   science fiction movie coming
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.420]   Maybe a stanley kuberick adventure
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.620]   Tim cluck methias -
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:06.780]   Yeah, I'd love seeing that on big screen. Was it fun?
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.300]   It actually does look like the canisters and permethias
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.780]   But the alien I love the rock
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:18.780]   Yeah, he has a very impressive. I saw it before the wolver. Hey, we're planning it perfect
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:21.340]   Yeah, this is something you'd like to see in a movie theater
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:30.060]   But how many of the people in the movie theater gonna buy this? Oh, there's the one little apple thing boom. Oh wow
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:35.180]   That's pretty good
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:41.180]   Didn't give me chills, but it's close. It's pure branding at every time. No, no one in the movie theater would probably buy it
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.780]   They're probably not even sure what a mac pro is people. But yeah, but they see the apple logo
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.660]   They see mac and they think that's hella cool and that's a good problem
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:53.180]   In a world where apple pro users have been using the same hardware for three years
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.220]   Comes not innovating anymore. I'm new
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:59.980]   innovation my uh
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:04.460]   That'd be funny. What's that we should do? Tim cook or Phil shiller
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.260]   Flying through the air six guns of blazin
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:12.860]   That's just ridiculous cars too was animated almost exclusively on mac g4s
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:17.420]   I know this for is that true now really? No, it's not true at all. I like
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:21.820]   All right, let's take a break focus on the water leo
[01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.300]   The trickling water
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:28.700]   Fish i've been watching for five minutes and not one fish is swarm up that fish lighter
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:34.940]   I keep meaning to find out like when like the breeding season is because i've i've been coming here for
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:40.460]   Like it's it's actually only like maybe of ten minute walk away from my my usual complex shop
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:44.620]   So I often walk past this hoping to see fish coming up the ladder, but nope
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:49.660]   Is it salmon that are you supposed to go up that ladder or is it tuna fish? What is it?
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:53.420]   I don't know probably there's actually there's actually a sign telling you what kind of fish
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.540]   You are not allowed to take out of the charles river and eat because it wouldn't be a shame
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:59.820]   If they spent all this money to build this and you're just waiting there at the top to grab fish
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.300]   Right from the top there
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.300]   Trout is a trout
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.220]   I don't know. I don't know. I believe what it whatever it is. It is speckled. I'm getting the words
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.580]   I'm seeing the word speckled. It's not salmon must be speckled trout
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.740]   Could be
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.780]   I don't know
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.500]   Nice, uh, maybe a nice delicious fish going upstream
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:24.540]   I just i've i've never been in walthem and
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.900]   Turned that corner and saw a bear staring at the center top of their like that's what that spike is obvious
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.220]   The squirrel is gingerly touching the spike
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.620]   We're going to take a break come back with your uh picks of the week
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.660]   mr. Andy Inaco from the chicago sun times
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.460]   mr. Renee richie from i'more.com
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:50.140]   Our show today brought you by our good buddies at citrix who do go to meeting with hd
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:52.620]   faces. I know it's
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:56.940]   You know one of those things nowadays where everybody spread out all over the place and it's
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.820]   Even here it's a real challenge
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:04.540]   Uh to have meetings but meetings are so important. It's where with you know mines come together to cut through
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:11.020]   the you know stuff that slows you down and and get to the get to the good stuff the creative stuff
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:16.940]   It is so important to solve problems and share ideas and that's why we use go to meeting
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:24.940]   With teams spread out all over the place is go to meeting means you're all in the same screen because you're literally sharing screens with one another mac or pc
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.220]   or
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:28.220]   iPhone ipad
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.860]   uh, you also get to see each other because hd faces means you're actually seeing high quality crystal clear video of
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:39.580]   meeting attendees it really is a powerfully simple way to meet and
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.260]   collaborate
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.300]   online
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:47.580]   No matter where you located you can even present from an ipad which is pretty darn cool. I gotta say

[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.700]   meeting
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:12.780]   Uh, even when we just do conference calls nowadays we use go to meeting because you never know you might want to turn on the camera
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:18.620]   Turn on the screen sharing and share with one another and you do get the conference bridge is part of the go to meeting subscription
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.100]   Go to meeting.com
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:26.460]   Good news if you're using uh, it's not my pick but I just if you've got a chrome if you're lucky enough to have a chromecast
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.100]   Google has released a chromecast app now for iOS
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:33.260]   Which means you can configure your chromecast from your iphone or your ipad
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:38.380]   You've been able to use it with them, but you've had to use an android device or a computer to configure in the past
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.100]   Andy and ico your pick of the week
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:45.900]   Uh mine is a really simple app called uh pixen it is
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:51.180]   It is a art app that is sort of like a resedit
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.820]   Times to 2013
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:24:02.700]   Uh, it's fun. I like doing art. I don't if you if you give me a 300 dpi photoshop canvas or or manga artist
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:09.260]   Canvas, I don't know what to do with it, but if you give me here is 256 by 256 pixels and tools and which to take
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.140]   Colored blocks and put them inside there and make something pretty
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:18.300]   That's a good way for me to kill 35 minutes and take a break at my desk without leaving the tool with which I need to
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:22.300]   Finish the project. I need to work on right now. Uh, it's 10 bucks
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:26.220]   And surprisingly a lot of fun looks like fun actually
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.660]   Yeah, because it it it will manage color palettes for you
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:35.820]   It gives you like cut and paste and move tools and reflect tools that make sense for this type of artwork
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.180]   And it really is it's it is the most
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.820]   It's a it's a truly meditative form of art
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:50.220]   And I I mean that I mean that sincerely that you really it's it's like
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:57.500]   Taking it's like being in a meditation garden with a sand and just sort of pulling that rake behind you and trying to make concentric circles
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:03.660]   Where you are trying to make something that's pretty but it is a contemplative act of simply placing blocks
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:09.260]   Saying no that is not where that block was meant to be. I shall remove that block and replace it with a block that is intended to be there
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:14.460]   Yes, that is the block that is intended to be there. I have reduced harmony between that pixel and that pixel there
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.860]   I move on to the next pixel
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.860]   um, it's it's
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:24.380]   10 bucks, which is expensive by by by certain standards consider what it does
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.620]   But I I've been enjoying it a lot
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.300]   And it's something that I kind of forgot
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:33.580]   I liked doing until like was going through just ancient ancient hard drives with backup images
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:38.380]   And I would see like all the icons that custom icons used to build and resedit and then I started thinking
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.580]   Gee, that may be fun to do again. And now now it's fun to do again
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.660]   Awesome
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.820]   Pick what is it picks
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.900]   It's picks in it picks in picks it with an ad pix you can get you can there's the demo webs
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:56.380]   That demos of it at picks. It's on the app store
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:59.740]   But you can get it at or get demos at picks an app.com or rather
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.420]   Interac excuse me look at demos not download a demo
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.940]   But it used to be it used to be downloadable from that from that place
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:11.340]   But now it's now it's an app store thing. It's supported by actual dollars
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:14.540]   Mm-hmm picks in
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:17.020]   Mr. We're in nay richy your pick of the week
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:22.700]   I have two picks this week one is software one is hardware the software one is
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.540]   Uh quick read so read quick, which is an app made by clait and morris
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.980]   We spoke about earlier
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.100]   It just came out for the iphone and had been on the ipad for a while
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:36.460]   And he was kind of hesitant to put it on the iphone because the ipad has this reputation for being a great reading device
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:42.540]   But it turns out an app designed to help you read quickly and to let you read things quickly is a great fit for the iphone
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.660]   Because if you're out and about standing in line waiting in the car
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.460]   Or doing any of a million other interstitial things
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:52.460]   The ability to get through content quickly is really amazing
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:56.940]   Now it's not you know, it's not that glass of scotch you want to save or that music you want to listen to
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.500]   It's for stuff. It's for information going into your brain. So it's pure data driven
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.060]   Reading but for that kind of stuff
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:08.940]   I started using it on the ipad and I still do but on the iphone now i'm finding it really enjoyable
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.980]   Especially just for focused quick reading
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.620]   And the hardware pick is something near and dear to both leo and my heart and that is
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:23.500]   Um, they were announced a while ago, but now they have at least in my apple store the bloom white bulbs available for the hu system
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.660]   Oh, oh, what is that?
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:30.860]   These are the big white bulbs and i've got two of them here just working as floodlights. So i'll hold one up
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.580]   Do they fit the same socket or is these are for the bigger sockets?
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:36.300]   They're not sockets. They are self-contained all you do is plug them in
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.980]   And then they sit on whatever flat surface you have
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.740]   They're color only but you can max out the color and they look white so you don't get the
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:47.180]   The light dark slider on the left. You just get the colors lighter
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:52.140]   But they work just like a hub. I have two of them sitting here you put them down you connect them
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:55.580]   You connect to them by a Wi-Fi and then using the existing hu app
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.340]   You can just have them do magic or ambefi you can have them dance to your music
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:03.580]   And they have strip lights too. So you can put those stairs or above cabinets
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:08.700]   And I have now 12 of the regular hues and three of these
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:13.980]   We have a problem. We have a huge problem. Leo if this is a problem. I do not want a solution
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.380]   I think so much fun. The strip lights are cool
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.580]   They're it's fantastic and they all just work together
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:23.580]   Oh my god. I don't know if there is a limit to how many you can have on a single bridge
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.820]   But I think there's a technical limit, but it's not it's pretty high
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.300]   64 or 120 something like that
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:33.820]   How much how much are the blooms the blooms at least canadian they were um 80 bucks
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.740]   So I don't know how much yeah, it is 80 bucks at apple
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:38.140]   5994 at amazon
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.780]   So same same price is the other hu abolbs and their led
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:47.500]   So presumably they last for a long time and if you're in a big room or just like your living room when you watch movies in
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:53.020]   It's fantastic for ambiance. I've joked about this before but I can watch star wars while my room looks like tatooine
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:59.020]   It's fantastic and the lights strip six feet 90 bucks. Oh, no amazon price on that yet
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.900]   Oh
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.100]   Man
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:05.100]   I'm gonna have a disco in my house
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.700]   Everyone's in life. I didn't know they were gonna do that. That is really cool. That is really cool
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:14.780]   We're hu fans and I think until you experience hu you shouldn't mock us
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:19.340]   That's all i'm gonna say about that join us join us. Don't mock us. It's nicer on this side
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:23.900]   All mock us if you play bioshock infinite, which was my game of the year this year
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.420]   Uh good news for you if you haven't played the original bio shocks apple
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:31.500]   The app store now has bioshock one and two at half off 10 bucks
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.660]   Uh

[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.780]   But 10 bucks for bioshock one
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:47.260]   If you didn't play bioshock one you really should one of the great games of all time bioshock two

[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:57.900]   And bioshock infinite is still mine one of my favorite games, but if you haven't played bioshock now you can do it
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.700]   cheaper half price

[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:38.940]   Which meant that I had to be really really when you when you're saying things that are extreme and superlative
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:44.780]   You want to be able to have the arrogance of which if someone says oh my god is that over the top where I can say scoot
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:50.220]   Roo you i'm right you're wrong true with me or you can argue with me but my
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:57.180]   My my energy for prosecuting my point of view is far exceeds your desire to argue with me on this point
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:01.900]   Awesome camera. This is why we love and he he does slow writing
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:06.220]   I know but yeah, maybe perhaps it should ship some time to

[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:34.860]   All of the innovation that was happening on the desktop than the laptop has now completely been replaced by mobile

[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   I think

[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:49.420]   But I have to admit with the amount of time it takes me to get something done. I'm more like the friend legal wits
