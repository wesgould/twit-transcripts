[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   Let me just sip a little bit of coffee.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   Oh, it's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers your Macintosh needs that, my friends.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   That is an Andy Inaco caught in the wild.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   We'll watch as the Andy Inaco swiftly beards his prey.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   We're using coffee surrounded by air quotes today, aren't we?
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   Yes.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   Okay.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Yes, it's the Jackie Gleason coffee.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600]   Oh, that was sweet it is.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Somebody put coffee in my thermos.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Good to have you, Andy.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   Also with us, of course, Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   And Leo, can I start the error hashtag?
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   Can that be a thing?
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   Oh, I love it.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   Instead of this, we'll do this.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   #SorryNotSorry.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   I love it.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Also, look, it's Mac OS Ken.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   Ken Ray is here from the Mac OS Ken podcast.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   Good to see you, Ken.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Oh, no, you're not going to be all serious.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   No, here.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   Okay.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   There we go.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   That's it.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   Live long and at Ruby.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   You see, I accidentally combined Pulp Fiction and Star Trek there.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   That's good.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   You're welcome.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.920]   And for those listening on audio, you're just going to have to imagine a bunch of strange
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.600]   hand gestures because really there's no point in describing this point.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   But join in and make your own.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   Make your own.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   So the hashtag is a good one.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   So it's like the peace sign with another peace sign across it.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   And that's air hashtag.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   I like it.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   Made history, Leo.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   You just let it be.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Let it go forward from this day forth that it was Renee Richie who invented the hashtag.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   When they come to tar and feather somebody at Shelby me.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   And the fact that it is also identical to an Antarctic and resistance movement as responsible
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   for most of the national service attacks, that's just accidental, isn't it?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   Isn't it?
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   That you've now sort of co-opted Leo into your little Leo mad bit or Antarctic independence.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   That's fine.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   No, that's good.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   You're ruining everything and not co- Oh, oh, I am because the resources of Antarctica belong
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.520]   to the world, not just some little splinter group who thinks it'd be a great Wi-Fi free
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.600]   zone in which it's practiced their ham radio.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Okay, I get it.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Two meter radio.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   Very important.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   It's been invented.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   What is it?
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   There it is.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   There's somebody doing it.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   How did you even find that Chad?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   There's all these people doing the air hashtag.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   I guess Renee did not invent.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.000]   Look, David Bowie invented it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It looks like I'm humiliated and upset.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.600]   As ABC News invented it.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   Wow.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Donald Trump invented it.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   What did you search for?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   Air hashtag.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   I think Donald Trump is air hashtag.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Did you mean air hotness or Sophia blush?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   First of all, it's air hosty.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   And second of all, it's Sophia Bush.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   But okay, but other than that.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   All right.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   Let's get to the news.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.320]   You know, there's a big war going on.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.600]   I thought this was kind of interesting.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   I thought this was about the iOS delay, which is a complete rumor and basically fabricated
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   this iOS 7 delay.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   And who was it that wrote a real?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   I thought a really good article about how this is just typical bogosity in the Mac press.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   As long as it's rumors, they're going to jump on it.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   Do you remember?
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   Was it?
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   It was actually a bogus Bloomberg headline.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   Wasn't it?
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   You started with Bloomberg.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   Right.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   But I mean, the headline was bogus.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   We got like seven or eight.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.000]   So the headline was something like Johnny I've risks delay of iOS 7 with, you know, all the
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   changes he's making.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Right.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.480]   And then I think it was seven or eight paragraphs then the Bloomberg piece said, oh, they're
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.600]   still expecting to ship it when they were planning on shipping it.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   Okay.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   And then, but then somebody didn't read the whole article.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.560]   I just read the headline and every Mac rumor mill, including I think us.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.360]   Said, oh, is OS seven delayed?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.320]   They're pulling OS 10 engineers off.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.920]   Is it not going to make it?
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   Right.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.480]   I think the only thing that they said, I want to say in the Bloomberg piece was that internal
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.320]   deadlines are being moved a little bit, which I mean, what I said on Mac OS can was it reminded
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.120]   me of the thing from the money pit where, you know, one of the characters says you were
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   almost late.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.720]   And he says, yes, and in the U S we have a term for that.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   We call it on time.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   You're supposed to be early.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.280]   And digit times is in there and everybody's in there.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.680]   So, I, Apple's I, this is the article from Bloomberg.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.720]   Apple's I've seen risking iOS seven delay on software overhaul.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.840]   And I, you know, I read that Apple high stakes gamble on iOS revamp, but it's all just, there's
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.300]   no content in here.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.540]   This is all just, this should be an opinion piece.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.140]   It's, it's a conflation.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.900]   It's a lot of things that are kind of shoved together.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.080]   I mean, Apple is a company that runs headlong towards their deadlines every year and they
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.640]   almost barely make it every year.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.440]   And it's the minute that that stops happening that I'm going to worry because they have,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.640]   you know, limited resources, they put all their engineers on it.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.800]   They don't sleep.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.040]   They pull people off OS 10.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   That's fine.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.400]   But they're, they're racing hard for the finish line.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.520]   That's what that's that's their one job.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.480]   I can't think of a time this hasn't happened.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   Exactly.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.320]   It points to the structure of Apple where they don't, they're not a bunch of competing
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.980]   divisions that would never like loan out people because the printer division wants the monitor
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.020]   division not to do well and both the monitor and the printer division.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   Right.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.080]   Don't want the CPU guys to get the advantage because they're all fighting for resources.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.760]   It really is, it really does come across as one big glom of talented people and Apple
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.640]   is more than willing to move those people around to wherever the forces is more effectively
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.040]   used.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:35.360]   So are we in agreement that iOS seven will be at WWDC in June?
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   Yes.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.520]   That it will ship on time.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   I say, well, they haven't said when it's going to ship yet.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.400]   So it's got to ship on time.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.960]   Well, I mean, I think, I think that it'll, I think that it'll ship in the timeframe that
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   everyone expects it to.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.880]   I don't, if, if anybody's expecting Apple not to ship a new phone sometime by the end of
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.320]   the year and for that new phone, not to be capable of running a new operating system,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.280]   they'll ship before the end of the year, welcome to the brand new world of knowing about Apple.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.120]   Our planet is mostly nitrogen based, but you can get by on the oxygen that we do have.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.680]   I don't think anybody's expecting anything different.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.600]   Yeah, I agree with Andy completely.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.640]   It's a new management team, which always has challenges.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   Scott Forest all is gone.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.280]   Johnny I was in charge of user interface now.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.880]   They're reportedly flattening things out.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.320]   They're not making it windows Metro flat, which is one of the rumors, but you know, supposedly
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   it's becoming a little bit more refined, a little bit flatter and all of these things
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   take time.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.760]   You have a limited amount of resources and it's going to ship.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.960]   I don't think Apple would have done WWDC invitations at all at this point if they didn't
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   have their products.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.720]   Well, that would be not to.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.320]   I would have freaked people out that.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   Yeah, not doing WWDC would be.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.120]   Well, not, not doing WWDC, but was it what three years ago, four years ago that it got
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   moved to August?
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.120]   Right.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.120]   Right.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.360]   That would have freaked people out.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.920]   But I mean, if it had to be done, they would have gone ahead and done it.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.800]   They've done a lot this year to freak people out.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.360]   So really moving WWDC would only be one more thing.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   So go ahead.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.640]   It's I was saying it's a story that resulted in stories about the stories that resulted
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   in stories about those.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:20.880]   I mean, I'm looking at the Gizmodo story that followed it saying saying Bloomberg says it's
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.560]   going to be delayed, which they didn't even really say.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.000]   Well, it's cut out words to you.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.960]   John Gruber did a piece on branch.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.840]   We had a discussion on branch and he said that he heard that OS 10 engineers were being
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.440]   pulled off of OS 10 to go work on iOS.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.120]   And that, you know, that usually means that they're not hitting internal deadlines or
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.960]   that they're, you know, trying to get a complete on time.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.760]   And now John, John Pichowski from the Wall Street Journal actually spoke to people inside
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   Apple.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.800]   He didn't name them, but he had sources listed and they said that's pretty much true, but
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.040]   it's shipping on time.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   And that's the story.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.280]   The stuff that came out around that is the insanity.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.320]   But the core story was that they're putting everything the way to the company behind it
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.400]   and they're going to get it done on time.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   Right.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.560]   In fact, they're, they're, we've coined it out and know who gets credit for this.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   A new word, deforestalization.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.520]   That was Pichowski's article.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   What does that symbol mean?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.600]   I don't unplug and replug your computer.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.400]   Unplug and replug my computer.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   I'm not showing anything of interest.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.880]   I hope that like you, you, you, you go through this life achieving things and having a point
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.880]   of view.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.080]   I just hope that I never create a situation where someone used de-inauguization as a positive
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   thing.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.840]   We're finally going to deal a port to it.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.040]   No, I, I think that that's, that's a pretty much signal that your life is over.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.520]   Well, well, he's, well, to be fair, it certainly means that he's, he's been trot-skied.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   Yes.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.760]   At least for, for, for, for maybe for reasons that, that, that he must take ownership of
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.360]   for reasons I've nothing to do with him.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.600]   And him just doing his job as best he can.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.240]   He is, I don't know.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.160]   I think he did move to Mexico City, didn't he?
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   He stays here.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   He would be aware of people with axes, you know, but no, we're just, what did happen
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   to Scott forest all this?
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.280]   He had another, he's with Andy Rubin and Stevenson, Oscar and some little twerk us somewhere
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.960]   planning to take over the walking.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.920]   I'm a vlogger now.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.160]   I'm inventing things like the air hashtag.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.800]   The new version of high photo can remove faces from quantity pictures with only a key
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   stroke.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Ironically, it's the best joke we're calling it to cover the Ken Burns effect is the Joseph
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.000]   Stalin effect.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.080]   Ironically, Android is phones are the ones that have that removal feature built in.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.040]   Maybe there's something going on there that was for Andy Rubin's benefit.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   Yep.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.680]   All right, well, so I wanted to start with that because I think we've talked a little
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.200]   bit about the notion there might be the lay.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.760]   We've certainly talked about the flattening of iOS 7, the and the removal of the skew morph,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.200]   skew of some of the skew morphism.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.920]   So again, I don't have to say that word anymore.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.680]   It's, but it's such an overused word.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.280]   People apply it to mean anything that's a rich texture or, you know, has any sort of elaborate
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.880]   design and it really is there's some webOS was a fantastic, see morphism with the cards
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   and the stacks.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:07.160]   The stuff in iOS is just heavily textured design that you can plan.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   Right.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.760]   So we'll just say a little less torn notebook paper, a little less green felt.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.640]   Well, a little less in project one way turns less wicked.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   You whack.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.680]   It's just, I mean, no more flair.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.160]   You take a glance at the screen for half a second, you glance away.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.440]   What is that you remember seeing them delete that thing from the user interface?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.600]   You'll probably be on your way to something good.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   The thing that's interesting about all these stuff is originally the stuff had a purpose.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.800]   So if you were just waking up in the morning or you were drunk and stumbling for your phone
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.560]   and you opened it up and you were on an app and you have no idea what app you last used
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.840]   on your phone, but if it was green felt, you know, instantly you were in game center and
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.800]   you weren't fumbling for the contacts trying to call somebody from game center or you knew
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.200]   immediately you were in find my friends because it was leather.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.840]   So it did help orient you.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.920]   The only thing is it was so ostentatious.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.120]   It's not going to be thinking about, oh boy, I wound up in the leather district of my
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120]   life.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   Oh boy.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   Exactly.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.320]   That's too morphic and blue.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.160]   But otherwise all screen starts to look alike and that's something they have to make sure
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.320]   they keep when they're they don't want to throw that out with a skeuomorphic baby water
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.560]   gives a new meaning to lickable interface.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.400]   There was there is one other thing though.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.480]   I mean, we can kind of laugh about how about the skeu morphism now because we're what five
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.520]   or six years into iOS or in the iPhone.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.920]   Initially things like that were probably great for getting people on board because think
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.880]   of how crappy, you know, your interface was on like windows.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.720]   Well, what was it called?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   Windows mobile.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   I mean, or my okay.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   Windows mobile.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   Think about like those kinds of things.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.560]   I mean, they looked really bad and we're kind of confusing to the average consumer, but
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.320]   the average consumer, like somebody who had not, you know, played with technology at all
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.440]   before could pick up something like newsstand or the iBook store, which I know came later.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.880]   But I mean, I mean, having that real world analog on screen, I think was probably helpful.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   No, absolutely.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.560]   And it goes back to the earliest days of the Xerox star and the first Macintosh is with file
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.760]   folders and things that looked like pieces of paper, little curled corners.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.800]   All of those things were very valuable, especially the first desktop interfaces.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.720]   And think about how delicious monster was to all this sort of stuff.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   Yeah, the beautiful book books books shelf.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.380]   I mean, to be fair, a lot of I don't think I think that iTunes is if there's one
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.760]   app that Apple can really fix and have a really quick impact by just fixing one thing, I think
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.800]   it would be the iTunes music player.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.400]   Because that's one area in which it really can be.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.040]   It really is kind of stuck in scrolling lists and drilling down where this is a consumer
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   app.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.320]   This is a consumer stereo that should be a little bit easier to simply navigate through
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.760]   by visual feel.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.640]   So yeah, you shouldn't want to strip.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.920]   You should need to strip things down to you.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.800]   You can strip things down too badly.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.700]   And ironically, Mike Mattis, who did delicious monster is now doing the chat heads at Facebook.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.140]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.140]   Hmm.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.900]   Is that a step down?
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.420]   Well, it's a change of his style.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.420]   That's well.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.420]   It's not a great feature.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.740]   I mean, I think that what we've all been complaining about is that if the chat heads
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.780]   were like in a Rolodex and you have to like do you move your thumb like this to scroll
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   through the Rolodex?
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   You know, no, I like it.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:28.220]   Little balloon heads show up on your screen and you can throw them like angry birds with
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.220]   your Facebook friends.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.020]   It really does.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.680]   It's just a matter of time before they actually gamify that.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   That would be kind of fun.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   Awesome.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   I'd like that.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   We're going to take a break.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   We're talking about Macintosh.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.980]   There is some Mac news.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.860]   There is there's more rumor news.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.660]   We'll talk about some Steve Jobs news.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.060]   Well, really kind of more like tips of the hat to Steve Jobs.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.900]   And yes, we'll play that phone ad.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:02.780]   Galaxy S4 at the senior graduation party that basically implies that iPhones are for gray
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.780]   beards.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.340]   We play the Windows Phone 1 2.0 with the Amazon.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.340]   That's a fun one too.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.340]   The war.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.340]   Yeah, we'll just play a bunch of ads.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.340]   Awesome.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.380]   But first let me do a real ad.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.740]   How about that for legal zoom.com?
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.740]   Legal zoom.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.900]   You've probably heard of them.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.340]   It's not a law firm.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.620]   But it is exactly what you want if you want to do a trademark, a patent, a will.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.580]   If you want to incorporate, you don't really need a law firm.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.500]   And if you're a startup, for instance, you probably can't afford a law firm.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.180]   If you're a blogger that wants to protect your brand, I mean, you're not going to spend
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.980]   thousands of dollars to get a trademark.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:39.180]   On the other hand, legal zoom makes it easy and affordable because a lot of the legal work
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.100]   that you need to do is really just paperwork with legal zoom.com.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.260]   Businesses can form an LLC as we did for 99 bucks.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.820]   By the way, that was in 2005 and it still holds.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.140]   It's the same LLC incorporation that we use today.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:03.900]   You can also just chapter a, I'm not chapter a S or C corp if you want for $99.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.040]   If you want to do a will, $69.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.040]   Legal zoom.com.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.460]   Register your trademark.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.860]   That's what Chad was going to do.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.100]   169 bucks was going to do.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.100]   Did you do it?
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.100]   Did you finally do it?
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.100]   You finished it?
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.100]   No, you just did one more thing.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   You see?
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.100]   All the hard work is done.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.100]   It's a questionnaire.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.100]   Yes.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.100]   Yes.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.100]   Online.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.100]   Yes.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.100]   Was it easy?
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.100]   Yeah, it was pretty easy.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.700]   It's mailing the example in the slide.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.460]   And the hard stuff is all the stuff that's required by the government, not by legal zoom.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.460]   Right.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.460]   And they walk you through like, this is what you need to focus on.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.460]   Yeah, exactly, right?
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.500]   This is what you need to focus on.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.220]   This is what this word means.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.180]   Are you trademarking OMG Chad?
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.180]   Correct.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.180]   Oh, that's so smart.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.180]   Correct.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.180]   Not that anybody would want it.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.180]   Right.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.300]   But let's, I mean, unless you're named Chad, I guess you could.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.940]   But let's say Nickelodeon comes out with a character OMG Chad.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.940]   You'd be pissed.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.260]   I would, and I'd be out.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.260]   Of course.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.260]   You have recourse.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260]   By the way, there are times when you're doing this and you may say, oh gosh, I could do
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.260]   that.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.260]   But what if I had a question?
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   Who do I ask?
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260]   There is, this is new since I use legal zoom.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.540]   They have now the legal zoom legal plan attorneys.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.060]   They've picked attorneys in almost every state.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.020]   They've got profiles and unedited reviews.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.540]   So you can pick that attorney.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.940]   They have pre negotiated rates.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.980]   Very affordable.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:31.180]   So those, you know, if some questions come up, well, should I be a Delaware or a California
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180]   Corp?
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.180]   That was when I had, I just guessed.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.780]   I flipped the coin.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.620]   Now you can actually ask somebody at a very affordable pre negotiated price.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.020]   Legal zoom really is for a lot of what you would do.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.740]   Everything you need highly recommended.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.660]   It's really no surprise legal zoom has been around for more than a decade now.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.940]   People have been using it to get their legal affairs in order.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.700]   If you haven't got a will and you've got kids, you do not want the courts to decide
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   what happens to your kids.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.300]   You really need to try this.

[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.300]   Good group for a legal zoom.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.540]   Take advantage of this.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:05.140]   All right, moving along talking about Mac and Tasha's with Renee Richie of iMore.com,
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:11.300]   Andy Inaco of the Chicago Sun Times and Ken Ray of Mac OS Ken.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.980]   So which ad do you want to see first?
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.980]   You want to see you?
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.980]   You have them both up there, Chad?
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.180]   What do you got first for us?
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.180]   Which ads do you want to be involved?
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.140]   We got the Nokia and the Galaxy S4 ad.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.140]   Oh, gotcha.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.140]   There's two ads.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140]   There's the one where it's the wedding party.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.140]   Yeah, let me show.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.820]   Brides family, brideside is all iPhone.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.900]   The groom or no, it's the groom side is all iPhone.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.820]   The brideside is all Android.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.980]   And then the waiters, the two waiters are going, why do they fight with their giant
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.100]   windows phones, taking videos of it all?
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.740]   And she says the most apt thing.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.700]   I think they like to.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.020]   Here, I can't find that one right now.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.020]   No, let's do this.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.780]   So that you've seen that one.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.020]   And there's guys using Siri to go, fine karate karate.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.540]   Yes, in the middle of the fight.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   It's really quite funny.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.180]   But the one that's a little insulting is this one.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:04.500]   This is a high school graduation pool party, a Samsung Galaxy S4 ad.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.500]   And this is the full app.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.500]   Nice guy.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   Great graduation party, sweetie.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   What are you doing?
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.740]   I'm taking a picture of these ribs with my new GS4.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.340]   Can't do that with an iPhone yet.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   You can't.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.580]   I smelt the ribs.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.060]   You can smell it.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.020]   You're going to be a woman.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.020]   This actually is kind of cool.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.020]   They do.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:28.980]   There's a feature on the phone that lets you do multiple images.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.980]   Hello.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.980]   He's eating.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.780]   Okay, no, wait, but this is a stop.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.820]   So this is a special thing.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.380]   When you're eating ribs, you can wave at the phone to answer it.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.380]   Right.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.220]   It can also sense ribs within a...
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.180]   You have to have Bluetooth enabled by the 18-inch proximity.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180]   Yeah, please.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.180]   Okay.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.700]   Now watch the guy who looks like...
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.700]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.380]   Can I share too?
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.140]   No, yours doesn't do that.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.580]   Yes, it does, by the way.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.820]   Wait, stop it.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.780]   This is always annoyed me.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.660]   And that's one thing they do in the Nokia ad where they do the bleep and the past pictures
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.860]   from one of the other.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.620]   The iPhone person says one trick pony.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.380]   iPhone had this first with bump, right?
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.620]   That's what bump does.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.220]   Very complicated, but yeah, it does that.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.860]   Third party solution.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.060]   But okay, but still, it's not something anybody ever does anyway.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060]   Exactly.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.940]   And to be fair, and step one is say, okay, first, do you have bump installed?
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.700]   Okay, go to the app store, do a search.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700]   Yeah, but...
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.700]   Yeah, but...
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.700]   But you have to launch the gal...
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.700]   I don't know.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.700]   I mean...
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.700]   I don't...
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:37.060]   Even though I do have phones with NFC, I almost never share things via bumping.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.900]   So it's an odd thing to want to do.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.740]   I tried to bump BBM contacts on my Z10 all last week and I think it worked once.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.420]   See, the great thing is that when you don't have NFC, that gives you an excuse.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.260]   Say, I'll email you that photo.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.300]   Why don't you give me your email address, young lady?
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.300]   Yes.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.300]   Yes.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.540]   Just show us how to get to you.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.540]   Samsung is anti-players.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.540]   Exactly.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.540]   So, here...
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:09.420]   Isn't it always really funny when an ad exec who's at least 53 and probably 43 to 53
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.380]   is doing an ad about how un-hip and how certain product is and how good heavens.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.060]   Well, watch, because here comes...
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.260]   What's that guy who does the...
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.940]   Is it Corona or Quirvo adds the richest guy?
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.940]   What is he?
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.260]   The most interesting man in the world.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.700]   He's in this watch.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.700]   He's not too...
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.700]   He's kind of clued out though.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   I know yours doesn't do that.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.700]   Wow.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.700]   Oh, he's on it.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.700]   See, now that's cool.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.700]   How do you nail that?
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.700]   I know something.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.700]   I know something.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.700]   I know something.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.700]   They're mostly showing up.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.700]   Here he is.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.700]   Here he is though.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.700]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.700]   Exactly.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.700]   Oh, gotta go back.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.700]   Go back.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.700]   'Cause this guy...
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   I know that.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.700]   I know that.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.700]   This guy is more than other smart phones.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.700]   Exactly.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   What are we doing with these phones?
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.820]   Call your phone with my phone.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.820]   You're old.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.820]   That's why.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.000]   Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Ooh, Tiffany texted.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Oh, I got it.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Okay, that's enough.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.240]   I'm so tired of this.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.300]   But Samsung's done this before and they're really now.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.460]   They're pulling out all the stops.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.820]   The iPhone is for old people.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.820]   Clueless.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.860]   One of Apple's biggest advantages is the coolness factor is the brand image and Samsung really
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.320]   intelligently is attacking that.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.900]   They're trying to make it look like your father's phone, your mother's phone.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.100]   The I-shaped phone and the lineup.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.940]   And it's an effective way to attack Apple.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.180]   Yes, it is.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.180]   They've got you.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.180]   It's really isn't...
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.540]   That's the sort of strategy that you have when you are profoundly number two.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.540]   You have a good product.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.140]   That's not getting enough respect.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.700]   That's the sort of like Bulldog stuff that you resort to.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.100]   Samsung is not number two anywhere.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.700]   It really is a market leader.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.780]   Again, if I'm...
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.780]   I am the...
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.340]   As I often say, I am the sort of person who is always when I'm in a public place.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.140]   I can't help but try to notice what kind of phone people are using.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.700]   And I see Samsung Galaxy S3s everywhere.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.420]   Sometimes I see them even more provently than the iPhone.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.900]   So once you get into that sort of position and add like this makes you look very cheap
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   and stupid.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.220]   It's hitting somebody when they're down.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.540]   And also provokes people to like...
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:07.140]   People like us to take a look at this ad and saying, "Yeah, you're not really demonstrating
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.740]   features that are endemic to this hardware.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.820]   You're showing off features that are essentially apps that probably exist in various forms
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.860]   on every phone, certainly the iPhone with the best software library."
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.860]   And secondly, let's point out that all that stuff is like comes preloaded on the S4, leaving
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:29.180]   you with very little, much less space on your internal storage for apps you actually do want.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.180]   So that's not the same.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.180]   It just doesn't work.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.180]   It just doesn't work.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   We got you talking.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.180]   We got us talking about this, Samsung.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.180]   Good for you.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.780]   And that part where you don't have enough of the storage.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.700]   I mean, that might actually affect consumers, but the rest of what you're talking about,
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.260]   I mean, you're talking like this ad was aimed at us and it's not.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.260]   I mean, the people that this ad is aimed at aren't watching Macbreak weekly.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.700]   Because they more than likely a long time ago chose a platform.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.460]   Either that or they walked in, they just took the first free phone that was offered to them
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.340]   and next time they're going to choose a platform.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.340]   Right.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.340]   That's a good point.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.340]   That's the answer.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.300]   I just worry about what happens in the long term.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.860]   I do think that this strategy, it works when you're on your way up.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:12.540]   It's not a great strategy when a company needs to maintain or keep going up once it reaches
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.700]   a certain level.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.220]   It does create the perception that we're not telling you that our product is very good.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.660]   We're telling you the other product is very bad.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.700]   That's a positive information that if you want to really maintain consumers.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.460]   It does remind me a little bit of the Apple on the Mac.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.460]   I'm a PC ad though, right?
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.460]   Same idea there.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   Well, Apple was way...
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.420]   I was thinking it's a good thing part of the market when they had those commercials.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.860]   The Windows one is more egregious because it gives Apple and Samsung such immense brand
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.380]   exposure that some people don't even realize it's a Windows phone commercial.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.100]   This one is a little bit better, but it still provides Apple and incredible one of advertising
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.260]   for free on Samsung.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.260]   We did.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.140]   We talked on Twitter about that Nokia ad.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.660]   That's a really good example of an ad that doesn't in any way sell the Nokia phone, but
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.340]   merely says, "See those other guys, they're jerks."
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.420]   And doesn't mention one feature of the Nokia phone.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.060]   I don't know if that's enough to get somebody to be a real person to buy a phone.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.700]   I thought it was an Apple commercial because of the guy's giant chest with the Apple on
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.700]   it.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:19.780]   I was an ad guy that I talked to who had about 13 years in the business last year was telling
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.140]   me about these type of broad approaches.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.940]   He said that the advice that he gives to clients is a variation of the old job interview
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.740]   advice, which is you should dress for the job you want, not for the job that you actually
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.740]   have.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.540]   You want to be a market leader, you should make the sort of commercials that someone who
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.660]   has an indomitably positive position in the industry should create.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.660]   I just like it because it's a funny ad.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.300]   It's a funny commercial, right?
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   It's an SNL skit.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.100]   Yeah, or a daily show thing.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.020]   Search one trick pony.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.020]   Aren't you a little young lady?
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   She didn't say Siri.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.860]   You want to go?
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.740]   I sheep, copy bots.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.220]   Auto correct this.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.940]   That's the best part.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.940]   I love that.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:07.700]   You got to be fairly oath.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.220]   Now every time I do NFC, I always go whee!
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.220]   Weeee!
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.060]   Somebody makes it more fun.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.060]   Oh, that trip!
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.060]   I want you to waste.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.740]   That's what kills me about this commercial.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.220]   I know that trip was beautiful.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.860]   I think if they knew about the Nokia Lumia, they'd stop fighting all this time?
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.860]   I don't know.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.860]   I think they know the white guy.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.460]   But they don't know about the Nokia Lumia because it's worth less fun.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:36.460]   And they're not going to know about the Nokia Lumia based on this commercial eating.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.900]   Maybe though, there are people who say, "I'm just so sick of the religious wars I just
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.900]   want to opt out."
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.580]   Do they know about them?
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.820]   My mom doesn't know about those wars.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.940]   She just sees the Apple commercial with the camera and thinks it's a nice camera.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.940]   Exactly.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.940]   That commercial works.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.260]   The one with the iPhone picture where they just take a lot of pictures with an iPhone
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.980]   and say the number one camera in the world is the iPhone.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.020]   That's a very effective ad.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.020]   It's heartwarming.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.020]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:11.380]   Web6264 in the chatroom says, "Why aren't we talking about iOS 6 validation for 5PS140-2?"
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.380]   That's the real story.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.740]   I'm just two of six people who care about it.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.220]   I can't talk about it yet.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.020]   I don't want to fly off the handle.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   I know.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   I know.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.540]   We're trying to talk about lightweight stuff because we don't want to think about the
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.540]   real stuff.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.540]   It's absurd to find there.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   Talk about it.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.540]   Okay, it's done.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   Awesome friend of prize.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.540]   Awesome for security.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.540]   Is it?
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.220]   Samsung still can't get its safe platform out.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   No.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.220]   Is it Knox delayed I think again?
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.220]   Yep.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.220]   Awkward.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.220]   Awkward.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.580]   Well, after all those commercials is a little...
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.580]   Didn't the...
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.580]   Who was it?
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.580]   The Army or somebody?
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.180]   The Defense Department just approved iPhones and galaxies for...
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.180]   For use.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.180]   No, they're...
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.180]   Government use.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.180]   They approved galaxies.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.180]   They're about to approve the iPhone.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.180]   Not to approve.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.180]   Like in the next couple of weeks.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.660]   Basically, that's just surrender.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.820]   That's just waving the wave flag.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.820]   We can't help it.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.900]   Everybody's bringing these damn things in.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.460]   We might as well let them use them.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:13.940]   The top smartphone OEMs according to COM score and its mobile lens in the US, Apple up 2.7
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:19.340]   points from December to March now 39% of the total US smartphone market.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.100]   Hardware sales 39%.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.700]   That's a record high share.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.940]   So you might think that the iPhone is completely dominant.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.780]   In fact, it is more dominant than it's ever been and it's still only 39%.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.740]   Samsung, not Android.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:38.820]   Samsung 21.7%, HTC 9% Motorola 8, LG 6.8.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.460]   I'm glad you brought that chart up.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.460]   I'm curious.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.700]   Andy, does that change your thought about that ad?
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   Because you're right.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.540]   Worldwide, we keep hearing how Samsung is dominating.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.300]   But Samsung is dominating worldwide.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.100]   That's a very US-centric ad that you're talking about.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   They are still theoretically on their way up here compared to the iPhone.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.300]   If you add all the androids together, it's 52%.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.620]   But I don't think people see it that way anymore.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.860]   I think really people see it as buying a Samsung, right?
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.860]   Thanks to Samsung.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.220]   Or buying a Motorola Droid.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.660]   It's co-opted to brand.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.660]   That is a good point.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.900]   When I speak about that such, I speak about advertising strategies as I understand them
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   to be.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:24.060]   And that's usually a strategy that a company abandons sooner or later.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.860]   And they go back to when they feel threatened.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:32.300]   There was another-- speaking to another analyst, this was two years ago.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.300]   So it might not be still of a common thinking.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:39.940]   But there was another analyst who uses that kind of as a way to decide where a company
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.940]   is.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.100]   But basically, one of the metrics he puts into his own little spreadsheet to figure out
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.100]   what is the attitude of this company towards their place in the industry.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.620]   What is their plan for the next two years?
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.140]   Good companies either completely silent or they start to speak about what they're up
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   to.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.220]   Bad companies who need to stall for time, often that becomes their entire corporate messaging.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.980]   Look up with these other guys doing, aren't they stupid?
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.500]   Aren't they foolish?
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.620]   According to another study, the iPhone is three times more reliable than Samsung Galaxy
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.620]   phones.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.380]   I never trust these studies, though.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.900]   I hear plenty of people who have trouble with either platform.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.220]   I don't know if I don't really know if there's--
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.260]   Part of the problem is it's coming from somebody who fixes phones, right?
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.740]   Or somebody who-- yeah.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.740]   And a lot of people who have problems with their iPhones go to the Apple Store.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   Right.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740]   Or go to Apple.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.940]   And I don't think Apple is saying, oh, man, have we had a world to hurt with the iPhone?
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.700]   It's because I don't have people who are you fixed.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.700]   Nobody knows.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.700]   It's a mystery.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:43.780]   There was an interesting article in-- I'm firstly kind of worried about what happens
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.380]   to my iPhone after my one year.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.620]   I didn't buy Apple Care for my iPhone.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.580]   I didn't buy the insurance for it because I haven't had a problem with my iPhone up
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.060]   to this point.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.380]   And so you go the first month when you can still buy it and nothing happens.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.820]   And so you roll the dice, right?
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.140]   There was an article in Business Week this week about a guy who said that he is on his
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.820]   third iPhone-- iPhone 5, excuse me.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.820]   I saw that article.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.820]   He kept having trouble with them.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.380]   I'm also on my third iPhone 5.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.980]   And it kind of worries me because at the end of the year, Apple's been great.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.260]   And it's not-- I didn't break it.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.260]   I didn't drop it in the toilet.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.260]   I didn't do anything to it.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.580]   It's tough to keep stopping with the iPhone.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.300]   And Apple's been fantastic about replacing it.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.620]   Both times it's needed replacing.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.460]   I'm curious.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.620]   Is that third phone?
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.620]   Has BucksCon worked out the kinks?
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.460]   And so it's going to be fine from now on?
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:38.180]   Or am I going to-- a month after my one year going to come up against something where internally
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:44.940]   something just went klugee again, and now it's $99 to get it repaired or more to get it replaced?
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.860]   So I mean, all of which is to say-- I mean, the study that you're talking about, I feel
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.300]   certain if you're talking about like Bob's Fix It.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.980]   They're seeing a lot more from Samsung than they are from Apple because, you know, Samsung
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.420]   doesn't have a store that you can walk into right now.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.020]   Apple, you know, probably you go to the place where you bought your iPhone, you say.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.020]   I think we just don't know.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.020]   I think we just don't know.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:10.460]   Did you get-- I got the new 614 with the improved speakerphone profile.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.460]   Yep.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460]   What does it do?
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.980]   I got a last night on my iPhone.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.780]   Someone comes to your house, takes the speaker out of your iPhone, puts a brand new speaker
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.980]   in, much louder, much better.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.780]   It's 11 and a half megabytes.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.340]   6.1.4.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:32.380]   And all it says is updated audio profile for speakerphone.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.580]   I don't know what-- have you played with the speakerphone to see if it makes a difference?
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.220]   I don't have very good hearing.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.780]   I'm not-- I'm the opposite of a golden ears, but I couldn't tell much of the difference.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.780]   All right.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.340]   A listener of mine wrote in and said that he had a friend who had had a problem with
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.900]   her iPhone several times and that this took care of it as far as the speaker goes.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.900]   So it's a bug fix?
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   Apparently.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.980]   Although it's a bug fix that they didn't identify for a while, again, this is according
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   to somebody who wrote to me.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.860]   And I appreciate him writing to me, but I can't say.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.980]   I was talking to a guy in Cupertino because I wasn't.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.060]   But he says that there were actually so many problems that some people were getting their
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.060]   iPhones replaced and now it turns out a software issue.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.060]   Wow.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.060]   That's true.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.860]   The phone would only work on speakerphone.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.660]   It wouldn't work through the earpiece or vice versa and they were swapping out phones
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.300]   for a while to deal with it.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.620]   And if this fixes that, then that's fantastic.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:24.500]   And now they have a lot of phones that actually work that they took in repair.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.060]   Real quick check on our Tim Cook auction.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.380]   It was 600,000 last week.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.580]   It's only 600,000, 5,000.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.540]   I think we've kind of reached the end of the line another week to bid for coffee with
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.260]   Tim Cook at Apple headquarters.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.020]   Now how much would you pay?
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.620]   I think there are a whole bunch of people who waned to snipe in at the last moment.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.620]   It's going to be sniped.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.980]   Holding back their $2 million bid.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.700]   It's a Russian billionaire just waiting this night.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:54.860]   So currently the high bid was it's now Jay star star star star star in, which looks like
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:00.500]   it's his office getting his name, but actually that's his name.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.820]   The current high bid he bid a Monday.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:10.420]   He bid $605,000 was more than a week after 10 days after the last time bid.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.420]   So I think you're right.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.100]   I think everybody's kind of waiting or we've really hit the end of the line.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.340]   This is in benefit for the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.340]   You should have it.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.220]   You had to figure that like someone who has $600,000 to spend on coffee with Tim Cook,
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.620]   he can probably find another 10 grand.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:30.020]   Oh, like not like this is, oh, it would be stupid.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.540]   Sometimes I'm bidding $600,000 because it would be stupid to spend more than that.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.420]   Look in your couch cushion, dude, you could probably find 10 grand.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.340]   Look mother said 600,000 are not a penny more.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.540]   I love it.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.380]   And that has to be my birthday and Christmas present.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.900]   I love it.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.540]   I said there be Steve Jobs news.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.540]   There is.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.900]   It turns out, according to an article in Network World, it's a new book coming out about
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:04.180]   the 2012 presidential campaign and in it, Jonathan Alter, who is, I've always liked
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.340]   him a lot of good writer.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.060]   He's a political columnist now at Bloomberg.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:14.660]   You've seen him on NBC tells of Steve Jobs personally ordering that Apple ads be removed
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.900]   from Fox News.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.900]   He held Fox News in such low regard.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.380]   In fact, I think he talks about it in the Isaac Sim biography.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.780]   He talks about Fox News being a blight.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.180]   He talks about how he had a conversation with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.340]   This is from the Isaac Sim biography.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.060]   You're blowing it with Fox News.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.460]   Jobs told him over dinner.
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.460]   It's interesting.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.780]   It's not about jobs is not saying I'm a liberal and Fox News is too right wing.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.300]   He's saying the access today is not liberal and conservative.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:51.460]   The access is constructive, destructive, and you've cast your lot with the destructive
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.460]   people.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.500]   Fox has become an incredibly destructive force in our society.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   You can be better.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   This is going to be your legacy.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.020]   If you're not careful, Rupert.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:11.020]   But what's interesting is he pulled his ads off of Fox News.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:16.740]   This same article points out that PBS is still advertising on Fox News.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.220]   So I don't watch a whole lot of Fox News.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.860]   There are a lot of those prestige brands advertising there.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.340]   The only time I get to see it is when I'm working at the Dunkin Donuts that keeps Fox
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.380]   News on the big screen all the time.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.860]   And I always see ads for Mercedes.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.340]   For your survival bunker.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.340]   Only gold bullion.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.140]   There's a lot of cash for gold.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.740]   There's a lot of that.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.580]   But there's Mercedes sprints on there.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.100]   There's some big brands.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:49.380]   Somebody on Reddit responded to this story and said he's a media buyer and that Fox News
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.700]   is on the do not buy list for some major brands.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.140]   I think you probably do kind of want to stay away from anything that's going to be a hot
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.440]   button.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.140]   However you feel about it.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.700]   You don't think it gives you free whose audience will give you a free dose of alienation no
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.700]   matter which way you swing.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.300]   Do you kind of figure that they're I mean that MSNBC is on a lot of those lists too,
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.300]   though, right?
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   Absolutely.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   I would figure.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   One's part of the left.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.740]   Why do you think CNN has decided to huge to the middle?
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.740]   Right?
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.740]   Where the money is.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.740]   Not the ratings.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.900]   It's a network like Canada and you can't argue over them.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.900]   Just one network.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.580]   I would say of so much trouble.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.340]   CBC, baby.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.180]   You get the Queen's network and you'll like it.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.380]   Does the CBC have a position on Stephen Harper?
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.380]   I don't know.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   I don't.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.860]   I stopped watching the news.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   I don't watch the news either.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.860]   I watch tech shows.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.660]   The news raises my blood pressure.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.900]   And I finally realized that if you're in a world of whatever, what is it, 8 billion
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.260]   people, you can find bad things happening almost all the time.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.940]   And so, you know, that's what you're going to see if you watch the news.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.260]   Bad things happening all the time.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.260]   It's bad enough.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.260]   I'll see it on Twitter.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.260]   Exactly.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.780]   I know I stopped looking at Twitter.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:08.740]   I have a Twitter button on the front of my phone and I used to like check it pretty religiously.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.340]   And I stopped looking at that too because it also raises my blood pressure.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.620]   Pretty soon it's angry birds and that's and even the pigs are really, really, really
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   making me angry now.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   So I don't even know.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.620]   I don't know.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.620]   Angry Leo's.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.700]   We have some plans for this.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.660]   That's the gamification of a, that's the gamification of the Facebook thing that you're
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.660]   talking about.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.100]   Angry Leo's angry, Renee is angry.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.940]   Everybody turns those little chat things into something you can knock off the things
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   over with.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.940]   Outrage.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   On your phone.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.940]   They're arguing amongst themselves.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.980]   I need, I need a new, I need a new, hey, you want to talk outrage?
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.860]   I know, you know, let's, this is a good one.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.260]   I want to do this on the radio show.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:50.540]   People with this $17 billion bond offering, we talked about it last week, largest bond
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.180]   offering in history.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.300]   The whole thing and you explain, I think it was you, Renee, who kind of explained that
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.980]   by borrowing money, they actually save money in taxes.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:08.420]   It turns out $9.2 billion in taxes and an additional $100 million a year in interest to
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.460]   deductions.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.220]   Is there outrage over this or are people just saying, hey, that's the way the law is.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.540]   They're taking advantage of the way the law is.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.060]   Outrage that Apple's buying bonds instead of repatriating all their money and paying
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.060]   taxes on it.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.060]   Yes.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.380]   I have a hard time speaking to the vagaries of US tax law, but you know, some people say
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.340]   that the US government should do more to help companies bring money back and some people
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.980]   say that companies should be doing more by paying more taxes.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.180]   Well, the money's off shore in the first place.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.820]   Two save taxes.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.820]   Yes.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.820]   That's what Google does too.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:48.020]   They channeled a lot of their intellectual property and licensing to Ireland because
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.140]   the tax law was more favorable.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140]   Corporate tax law was more favorable.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.900]   And I believe almost at least tons of high tech companies that I know of do exactly the
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.900]   same thing.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.660]   Almost every law that you write, people will spend time figuring out how to get around
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.180]   that law that you've written.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.300]   So Apple's just is playing the game as it's set.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.540]   You can't really blame them, right?
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:14.060]   I think that a lot of these blogs are trying to gin up a little outrage.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.940]   But I don't think it's a story.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   And it is.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.900]   If you think about $9.2 billion in taxes, Apple won't be paying by doing this.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.620]   But hey, it's the law.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.260]   And what's $100 billion repatriated?
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.180]   That $30 billion in taxes?
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.180]   Taxes are not though.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.820]   I mean, how much better is it to get somebody else to give you money to give to somebody else?
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.300]   I mean, Apple has a lot of money, but they want to give money back to shareholders.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.380]   So they come up with this plan where they're like, I want to give people a lot of money,
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.540]   but I want to use your money to do it.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.540]   It's very clever.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.380]   People are like, yeah, sure, take my money because you're going to give me more later
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.180]   because it's not like they're going to stop making money.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:55.540]   So I mean, even if it doesn't say the diamond taxes, if they still get to sit on $144 billion
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.020]   and give away billions of dollars to other people, that's awesome.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.300]   I wish I could come up with that.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.900]   I don't understand any of this at all.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.460]   That's why I don't do my own taxes anymore.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.340]   But I watch what Lisa, who runs the business and others do.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.780]   And there's a certain mindset and these guys are very smart and they're always thinking
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.180]   of ways to take advantage of the way the laws are structured to save money.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.100]   And I don't think that's wrong.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.620]   Maybe we should change the laws.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.460]   Or the nature of companies.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.860]   I mean, they have, again, one job.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.860]   They're just sharing response.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   They're holding their value.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.100]   Yeah, not the pay tax.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:36.700]   If they didn't do that, they would be violating their fiduciary duty to the shareholders.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.700]   Oh, here comes a whole bunch of new Tim Cook must be fired.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.380]   The thing that really gets up people's noses, though, is when you see companies that even
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.900]   the situations that are in right now where they can produce these huge, huge moves, that's
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.900]   not enough for them.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.980]   They want to continue to rewrite tax code and rewrite structure code to make sure to
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.740]   give themselves even more advantages.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.100]   So if Apple were doing things like that, if they're lobbying to say that we are going
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:08.940]   to redefine our employee pay as maintenance to physical plant structure.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.540]   Because there's a better way for us to write that sort of stuff off, then yeah, it would
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.540]   be a scandal.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:23.260]   But no, I mean, I believe there is a charming young person colloquialism about how we are
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:29.380]   to not place our fault upon the play, but upon the game itself.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.180]   I believe that has some relevance for discussion today.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.220]   Yes, to lame the it was far pithier.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:39.380]   It was a lot of people dancing around doing moves with the hands.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.260]   I was quite distressed.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:48.140]   You know where they're giving that extra money to the 50 billionth app downloader.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.620]   So we talked about this on iPad today on Thursday.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.500]   Now, and I'd like to know what you think.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   There's a counter.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.220]   Apple's counting down to 50 billion app downloads.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.380]   And there's a $10,000 gift card in it for you if you're the 50 billionth.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.620]   And then I think some hundreds of other people will get some money.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.420]   I think they could have gone to 50 grand.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.740]   If 50 billion apps, you know, Apple's not a poor company, they could have done, you know,
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.980]   a big show stopper 50 50,000 in iTunes bucks.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   You'd never spend it your entire life.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.940]   So my question is going to get $10,000 without even realizing they're running air contest.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.780]   There's a $50 billion, right?
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.340]   Somebody's going to download.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.980]   That's a lot of words for the first time.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.940]   I mean, episodes of Mad Men is that.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.900]   My question is, can they really know the 50 billionth download?
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   Hmm.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.100]   They've got a counter right on the website.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:48.140]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.700]   It seems like that would be a hard thing to know.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.180]   Now somebody says, no, they number every transaction.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.660]   Every transaction has a sequential number.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.660]   Does it?
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.660]   I don't know.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.900]   In the movie, Will Fertile steps over the plug at that exact moment.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.460]   It's about to hit 50,000.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.060]   I think, and by the way, you can also enter.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.180]   You don't have to buy.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:09.060]   You can send them a postcard or something.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.020]   Limit 25 entries per person per day.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:17.060]   You know that really, you really give me an idea that I'd love to know exactly how these
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.540]   sort of contests are run because you're correct.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:25.060]   How do they manage the things where someone will, how do you really judge and happen in
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.060]   app purchase?
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.260]   How do you really get to that actual metric of yes, this is not the person before, not
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.540]   the person after it.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:36.340]   And then how do you judge postcards coming in and how do they weigh against it?
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.780]   There must be, I know that for contests that are run by, national contests that are run
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   by large corporations, they actually have contractors out who know how to, who.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.500]   Cause there's so many legal angles in the app because you will get a class action suit
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.220]   just for entertainment value from someone who doesn't think that, well, according to
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:47:00.820]   my calculations, the winning app was actually the 49, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9 millionth app download.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.580]   I'd really have to know how that works.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.660]   Well, here's my, here's my reason.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:09.300]   I mean, yes, of course you could number things sequentially, but there's so many apps being
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.300]   purchased all the time.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.540]   I don't know how many it is, but I would guess that any given moment, there's 10, 20,
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.860]   100, 1000 apps being bought all at the same time.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.140]   And so you can't really say there's a sequence.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:26.460]   They're not, they may be separated by milliseconds, but, but I bet you even within any given
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.700]   millisecond, there are a number of transactions.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.660]   So I was looking at the rules to see if they clarify.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:36.020]   They must say somewhere winners chosen at random from a group of people.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.540]   All I saw at the top was persons located in the province of Quebec, Canada are not eligible
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.540]   for this promotion.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.900]   And that's why because Quebec understands it's a scam.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.620]   I does say on the, on the page counter for illustrative purposes only.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   Yes.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.260]   So that's just an imaginary JavaScript counter has.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.260]   But I screencapped it.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.660]   I screencapped it when I download it.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.060]   Anyway, somebody's going to get some, uh, some.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.980]   It sounds like a pitch for comedy star and Kevin James.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.980]   Yes.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:10.100]   Well, you would think that there's somebody like a set up a boiler room buying apps, but
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.540]   that's probably why by the way, it's only $10,000.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.540]   Think about it.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.340]   If that price too high, then somebody does do that.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.940]   But as an iTunes card, I don't know.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.780]   Like, what are you going to do with 50,000 iTunes?
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:25.220]   I was actually thinking, so if somebody who just sends in one of the entries, but doesn't
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.620]   want to download an app wins the $10,000 iTunes.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.500]   I just kind of upset a lot of people.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.420]   Well, because part of the, yeah, part of the real value of this is, uh, to the app, the
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.780]   10, the 550 billionth app, remember the first time that is it was the millionth app and
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.780]   it was bump.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.780]   And I still remember that.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.780]   And that gave bump a big bump.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.300]   But there's also the cost of winning.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.860]   Like, realize, and of course this isn't, this is not exactly this is essentially an
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:57.260]   opportunity to purchase $10,000 worth of app store content for like probably $3,333.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:58.260]   Right.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:03.740]   And I'm not sure that I, like Renee said, I'm not sure that they have $10,000 worth of
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.460]   things that I want.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:09.820]   Even if you do throw in all the music, even if you do throw in like all the, I could, I
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.260]   would be a real Brewster's millions sort of thing where it would be easiest pie to spend
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.580]   the first $2,000.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:21.900]   I could probably find another thousand or $2,000 to spend by the time, like I get to $7,000,
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.500]   it would be like fine.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.460]   Everything with an accordion in it.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.580]   And I, whatever, I just want to spend the rest of this.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   I don't want to have to do it.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.780]   You pay the taxes up front.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:35.020]   You pay the taxes now on the 10,000 you might spend later.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.060]   And then you end up brokering this off to some two bit intermediary.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:43.220]   If I win, it's, it's, it's, it's that, it's that kind of commercial that's on Fox.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.900]   Like when I'm watching a broker, you want to get the whole value of your $10,000 iTunes
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.140]   gift card.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.580]   Our operators are calling down for free consultation.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580]   It's business.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   We buy our duties.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.580]   Yes.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:00.940]   I just would buy a bunch of donuts and tapped out and I never have the largest donut purchase
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.700]   in the history of the town.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.940]   Well, that would almost, that would almost be funny and worth it.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.820]   Like to, to simply say, I'm going to spend this all to completely crash the economy of
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.820]   one game.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   That's a good idea.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.820]   One multiplayer game.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:18.340]   And basically say, no, there's no, I will be the god of this, this online game because
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.220]   nobody can outspend me.
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.580]   I will, I will, I will like, you know, if I find that someone's farm is doing really
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:30.260]   well, I will put like eight, like this, like nuclear reactors around it to kill it off.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.180]   I will be the Mr. Burns of this town.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:39.300]   I mean, every single game ever made.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.580]   Or just offshore it.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.580]   And then you have to worry because the taxes are paid by somebody else.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.060]   You have to win your iTunes gift card offshore.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.060]   That's the trick.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.220]   Set up an offshore corporation now to buy those new apps.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.740]   We're going to take a break.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.100]   Come back with more Renee Richie from imore.com.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.540]   I want to get the rumor rundown.
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.620]   We have to start a new segment and I'm more rumor rundown.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:09.340]   I get Timpones and horns have a special open also from Mac OS can can Ray is here.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.380]   What do you do this daily daily news for the Macintosh?
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:18.300]   Highly recommended anybody who's into the Mac and isn't listening.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.540]   I mean, I mean, to be fair, it's Apple.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.980]   It's been a long time since anybody yelled at me about that, but I should complain.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.500]   Well, we're Mac break weekly.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.020]   We should really call it Apple or iPhone or something.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.020]   I break weekly.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.020]   I break weekly.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.220]   There's very little clam juice in Clomato and yet they still call it Clomato.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.860]   I think we're okay.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:43.460]   Bloody Caesars are better than bloody men.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.180]   And then day six, tell me about that, Ken.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:53.540]   Oh, that is a premium thing for people who listen who want to help support the daily deal
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.100]   that is Mac OS can.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.860]   So you're free for five days.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.860]   Yes.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.100]   And the sixth day.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.020]   The sixth day is something else entirely.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:06.740]   It's interviews and sort of longer considerations of stuff like we just this past weekend talked
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:12.460]   to Alison Sheridan from the Nacilla cast and Dave Hamilton from the Mac Observer and
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.860]   Jeff Gamet also from the Mac Observer and Chuck Joiner from Mac Voices.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.220]   And it was just the four of us having this well, four different conversations, just wide
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.900]   ranging, weird sort of thoughts on the future, which so it's not always I mean sometimes
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.540]   it's big interviews and sometimes it's a bunch of friends getting together and saying,
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.140]   yeah, what's up with that?
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.740]   But it's a great idea.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.140]   So you give away the five days and you make your living on the sixth and it's a way for
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.140]   people to support you.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.140]   And I think it's great.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:44.460]   If you go to MacOS Ken.com, you can find out more.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.060]   And here's the day six thing right there.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.060]   It's up there.
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.940]   That's where that redirects to the old site.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.580]   So that needs to be fixed.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.580]   You moved to Squarespace.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.580]   I did move to Squarespace.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.580]   Good man.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.300]   They came on as a sponsor a few months ago.
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.420]   And you know, so I was prepared to talk really nicely about them, but now we're talking
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.980]   nicely about them any chance I got whether they're sponsoring or not.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.380]   We have a Squarespace ad later.
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.220]   You can actually I'll do it right now.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.020]   Well, I don't want to segue into that right now.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.020]   Why wait?
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.020]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.020]   You know what's great?
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:20.500]   Sure, the thing I like about Squarespace and those guys is that they support the podcast
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.620]   community big time.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.700]   And they've been a huge supporter.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.460]   They've been an advertiser with us for a couple of years and a huge support, one of our biggest
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.740]   advertisers.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.380]   And I like it that they believe in and give back to the community.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.660]   And I mean, can I talk about them?
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.660]   So how's your experience been?
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.660]   Love it.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.500]   The level of control that I have, I had a website.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.500]   I've had two.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.260]   Well, this is the third version now of the Mac OS can website.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.700]   The first one was done by a friend of mine.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.260]   It was done in about 15 minutes.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.580]   She basically set me up with something that I could update every day.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.980]   And then another friend of mine, like about a year and a half, two years later, surprised
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.820]   me, just totally redid my website.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.100]   I mean, I mean, then got my permission to change it.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.580]   He didn't, you know, just I didn't wake up.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.380]   Why did you do your website?
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:10.340]   And then, you know, so he got really busy, like it turns out he got a life and a job and
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.220]   ended up being part of a successful company.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:15.900]   And so he didn't have, you know, the time to go in and change stuff anymore.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.060]   And so basically I sat with the same website for about four years, which was probably three
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:24.740]   years longer than I should have, just because I would have ideas of things I wanted to change
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.740]   and I would get in touch with them.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.540]   And then, you know, it would take months.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.540]   Right.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   And that's not harshing on him.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.220]   He did a fantastic, you know, did a fantastic thing.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.940]   And now he's doing many more things that leave him with less time.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.100]   The cool thing about Squarespace has been anytime I have a new idea.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.420]   I always think, okay, so I'm going to set aside an hour.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.420]   I'm going to go in.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.620]   I'm going to put this together.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.820]   And then I've got 50 minutes left over because everything has been so incredibly easy with
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   it.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.820]   See, I sound like a believer and it's because I am.
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.820]   So, yeah.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:58.460]   Plus, if everybody goes right now to Mac OSKEND@squarespace.com, what would normally bring
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.740]   any other site down would have brought the old site down.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.820]   We'll not bring this site down because Squarespace is, you know, kind of the best hosting out
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:05.820]   there.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:10.060]   And it's because I believe that the content management system is so tightly tied to the
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.460]   hosting software that they can do this.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.980]   It's all done with virtual servers in such a way that if any site starts to get very,
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.420]   very busy automatically, more bandwidth flows to that site.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:23.580]   So you just never see, they're always responsive, always fast.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.060]   You never bring it down.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.660]   Do you have you used the new commerce feature yet?
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.260]   I have not used the commerce feature.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:34.900]   So you could start using it instead of, say, PayPal for the sixth day.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.900]   You could.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.900]   You should.
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.180]   You never thought of that, did you?
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.180]   So here's.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.180]   I know.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.780]   I witnessed the fact that I had the same site for four years.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:46.420]   So it's one of those things you'll get around to.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.420]   I know.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.700]   At some point, I will.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.420]   This is a nice new feature Squarespace.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.420]   So visit squarespace.com.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.620]   One of the nice things about Squarespace is very easy to try it.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.060]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.060]   Just go there and you get two weeks free with all the features.
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.220]   You can try all the templates, gorgeous stuff.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.780]   See how easy it is to customize it.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.660]   Every site looks unique on Squarespace because of that.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:12.380]   And then when you decide, I want to maybe make this my own home, you should really take
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.180]   a look at the pricing because it's very affordable.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.180]   And one of the things somebody like Ken could do is sell stuff because they've added the
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:22.100]   Squarespace commerce and it's great.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.460]   They set you up with a merchant account.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.700]   You don't have to have a merchant account to begin with.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:34.060]   You can sell digital goods like day six or physical goods like CDs or books.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.580]   And the pricing is kind of amazing.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.100]   They don't take any of your sales.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.540]   The basic plan is $8 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:47.140]   The unlimited plan, which is the one we recommended for a long time, the $16 a month gives you
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.140]   unlimited bandwidth.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:53.260]   This means you never get a bill because you got popular unlimited storage, unlimited pages,
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.740]   galleries, blogs.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:57:01.100]   But then for $24 a month with the annual plan, you also add e-commerce to that list.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.180]   Unlimited physical, unlimited digital products.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.180]   You get a mobile store.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.500]   They do tax.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.860]   They do shipping.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.060]   You can have coupons.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:12.140]   You know, if you want to come on this show and say, I'd like to give 10% off to everybody
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:16.740]   who uses the offer code MAC break for, you know, day six, you could do that.
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.780]   You could literally set that up while you're talking on the show.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:19.780]   It's that easy.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.900]   $24 a month.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.340]   And they don't take a cut of your sales.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.580]   That's it.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:30.500]   When you buy the annual plan, $30 if you want to go month to month, they also offer that.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.340]   And I've got a way you could save 10% off that first purchase, which is probably why
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.540]   you want to get the annual purchase.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:38.020]   Oh, one other thing when you get an annual plan, they will, and you should do this, Ken.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.980]   I know you're doing it as a spiff to them and says, macoscan.squarespace.com.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:46.420]   But you can also have the domain, the custom domain name, and they'll automatically hook
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.460]   that up and they'll set it up for you for free when you buy an annual plan.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.500]   I want you to try it free.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:56.060]   Since they just did the platform upgrade last fall to a Squarespace six, now they're
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.380]   continuing to roll out new features, integrations, new templates, this commerce.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:05.860]   This is a company on the move and you're going to be very, very, very happy.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:06.860]   Squarespace.com.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.780]   Oh, they added it to just add a new calendar feature.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   I forgot to mention this.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.380]   The events collection that lets you share schedule updates.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.900]   So Ken, you could have, you know, you could have your schedule on there who's going to
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:22.220]   be on day six, band tour dates, store sales events.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.380]   There's a new template called momentum.
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.500]   I should show you momentum.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.140]   It is so beautiful.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   Here's how you can try the templates.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.020]   You just click the get started button.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.780]   And the first thing it'll do is say, okay, pick a template and you can see all these
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.340]   great looking templates.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:41.220]   I mean, they're just Isha Moto Hudson.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.380]   Where is the new one?
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.380]   Where's momentum?
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.340]   Get out of there, charms bar.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.020]   I'm talking here.
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.060]   Is that it?
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.060]   Montauk.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.420]   Anyway, the new template is out.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:59.620]   And if you can find it at a Rondack flat iron, by the way, these are just the, there it is.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.620]   Here's momentum.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.100]   These are just the starting points.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:06.420]   And what's cool about this is you're going to customize it so it's going to be absolutely
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.900]   unique.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:11.420]   These are all built with momentum and they all look different.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.100]   Momentum is a very cinematic display.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.420]   It's all full bleed.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:20.820]   So if you're really big on the imagery, you're going to like this because the site just is
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.540]   all picture.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.540]   Really nice.
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:28.200]   They've got a layout engine that lets you customize pages in seconds by adding blocks
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.020]   of content like photos, videos, text, social media.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.920]   It's all what I really like about it.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.740]   It's all mobile responsive.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:42.140]   So this looks great on a high res full screen, but also can look just as good on an iPhone.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.440]   Squarespace.com when you use our offer code MAC break five, you'll get 10% off your first
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.840]   purchase on new accounts.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.900]   That's monthly and annual, but get annual to get the best savings.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.100]   Then you only do that when you buy.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.520]   You can try for free.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:58.580]   MAC break and the number five for the fifth month, squarespace.com.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.940]   OSKN certified.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.420]   That was a long ad.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.780]   Sorry about that.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.060]   I get a little excited.
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.460]   MAC break quickly, but your ad dollars stretches far.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.860]   Yeah, they really do.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.860]   Sorry about that.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:11.860]   Everybody.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:16.940]   Consumer report says Apple's numero uno in customer support.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.940]   Are we surprised?
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.940]   Not really.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:23.600]   I don't know.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.120]   Am I allowed to show the consumer?
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   I don't think I can.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.120]   Consumer reports is funny about that.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.600]   Apple topped its score from last year when it was also number one.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.880]   Consumer reports in their press release.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.240]   I can quote that.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.480]   The company scored far higher than the other big companies for the elements that make for
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:47.860]   successful online and phone support ease of contacting staff, clarity of advice, technical
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.260]   knowledge, patience, and time for follow up.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.260]   I'd agree with that.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.900]   I think Apple's very good in that.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.880]   It's the last, but that's part of why that you pay the Apple tax.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.820]   I got to point out PC margins are so razor thin.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.480]   That's why PCs are so cheap.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.140]   They can't afford to give you good tech support.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.140]   That costs money.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.300]   It ain't free.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.860]   They can afford to give you a button.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:13.300]   It turns off your trackpad, but they can't.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.840]   I feel kind of stupid now.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.020]   I was bitching a money before the show because I couldn't get the trackpad to work.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.660]   Somebody in the chair said, "Did you push the button that turns it off?"
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.100]   I said, "Oh, where's that?
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.100]   Oh, yes, I did it."
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.100]   I had it checked.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.100]   Whoops.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.260]   Apple has updated the iMac lineup.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.300]   There are new storage options.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:38.580]   You can get a 256 gig flash or a 512 gig flash drive.
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.700]   I think that's great.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.940]   I only buy flash drives now.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.580]   This is on the iMac.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:49.860]   I have a fusion drive on my 27-inch iMac, and I like it, but it's still not as fast as
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:53.200]   a pure flash drive would be.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.600]   Do you think we're transitioning towards a destiny where Apple is going to make it easier
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.520]   for you to buy flash stores and hard drive storage?
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520]   Yes.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520]   It increases the cost of everything.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   It's all anybody wants.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:11.600]   If an Apple does charge a premium, your Mac comes with a 5,400 RPM 1-terabyte drive.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.760]   That's pretty slow.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.960]   I'm telling you, if you've thought about this, it's worth the money to get the upgrade.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.120]   You go from a 1-terabyte drive to a terabyte fusion drive.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.120]   It's faster.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.640]   It's 250 bucks more.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.880]   For 300 bucks more, you can get a 256 gig pure SSD.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.240]   $600 more, you get a 512 gig.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.280]   So that's the problem is you don't get as much storage.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.920]   I would rather see them, frankly, and this is what I did in my Mac Pro, have a very fast
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.880]   SSD for boot and operating system, and then put the data on a spinning drive and not try
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.240]   to marry them together as with the fusion.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.640]   Any can or Renee experience with fusion that you want to talk about?
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   Not yet.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   I have not played with it yet.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.720]   I'm waiting for all the next generation chipsets much like yourself.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.920]   You know, I have it and it's definitely faster than a normal spinning drive, but it's kind
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.360]   of unclear and I've been reading some of the more technical reviews of it about how
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360]   effective it is.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.280]   The idea is that Apple will move the most red files to the solid state drive where they
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.720]   can be read faster and the less red files will stay on the spinning drive.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.000]   But I'm not convinced that it's really doing that much.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.920]   And I think that's noticeable when you put a real SSD drive, especially if you have a
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.480]   Mac Pro, I put an Express card SSD drive in and man, does that make a difference?
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.440]   60 and zero seconds.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440]   Unbelievable.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:45.760]   I'd love to see like a cloud based hybrid drive where because if you're afraid of the
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.600]   cost of solid state storage, you can get 128 gig, even 256 gig like swap placement drives
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   on Amazon for just close to not that much more expensive than a spinning drive.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.440]   And if you were able to, if this were really intimate with a cloud service that could figure
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:10.280]   out that you've got about for this mobile device, you've got let's say an extra 500 gigabytes
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.520]   of online storage or you can put stuff in the cloud and we'll just simply figure out
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.000]   that, okay, he wants to open this.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.520]   I'm not going to tell the difference between what's on board and what's in the cloud.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.480]   I'm going to simply pull things down off the cloud as needed and guess that this is what
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.680]   he needs and what he wants to use the storage for.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.440]   As long as I was backed up with the idea that I can pin certain folders and certain documents
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.080]   to say that these should always be in both places simultaneously, it might be an interesting
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.400]   alternative.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.480]   It does seem like every manufacturer wants to get into a place where they no longer have
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.680]   to go to the expense of physical hard, spinning hard drive storage and they can simply print
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.720]   everything onto one board in the manufacturing process and that's it.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.120]   It also has the side advantage to the manufacturer of sort of making it more difficult to upgrade
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.720]   later on and sort of not forcing somebody to buy a new computer in two years but at least
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.400]   making that more attractive than holding onto what you got.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:13.640]   Let's talk Haswell because on Monday yesterday Intel announced its next chipset, the Haswell
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:23.760]   chipset which is a 22 nanometer x86 processor that's going to be available in PCs and presumably
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.560]   Macs soon.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.000]   Andy you said you had some thoughts about Haswell.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   I'm waiting.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.480]   I really want a new MacBook Air.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.880]   In fact what I want is a MacBook Air with Retina and I'm really hoping that the new Haswell,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:46.000]   sorry about that, the new sh*t up, the Simpsons, they want me to clear up some snakes.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.760]   That the new Haswell will have enough juice to make us give us a Retina display MacBook
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   Air.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.800]   It's not the juice though.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.160]   The Retina MacBook Air is waiting for better battery light.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.960]   There's just no room in that case.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.640]   But that's what I mean when I'm sorry, I didn't mean speed, I meant battery.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:10.480]   Haswell is a much lower power chip with better graphics performance.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.320]   It might not be applicable to that need.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:20.760]   When I mentioned that I had things to say about Haswell, it's in the broader sense that
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.040]   when you talk, every time I've talked to Intel and they come through Boston and we
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.200]   have a nice long lunch, we talk about all kinds of things.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.480]   They're fairly open with me about how they have a long-term strategy for CPU that's
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.960]   partly designed to fuel the next generation of ultra books no matter what it is.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:43.080]   They were even fairly, surprisingly given the context open about even two or three years
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.920]   ago about where they were going with ultra books.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.360]   They were saying that the first generation is not going to be great.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.280]   The next generation is going to be a little bit better.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.760]   The third generation is going to be better than that.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.640]   As they keep building new chips specifically for the purpose of creating really, really
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.160]   good powerful machines that run very, very little power.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.560]   Now we're starting to see the real meat of their chip strategy.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.960]   Haswell not only has graphics acceleration to allow a manufacturer to put more content
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   on one tiny little die surface, but also power management that allows the CPU to go idle
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.480]   a lot more frequently than any previous architecture, any previous design.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.960]   So the problem with driving a retina display, while that display is alive and being driven,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.320]   that's not going to save them any energy at that point.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:37.240]   But if you're comparing to a nominal display, the amount of time that the CPU spends just
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.120]   waiting for you to do something, anything stupid human, it's going to draw a lot less
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   power.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.680]   So this is a chip design that's going to elevate pretty much every different mobile PC that's
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.760]   going to be out there.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:54.080]   It might even make it a little bit more difficult for, it'll make it much easier for Windows
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.800]   8 notebooks to compete with MacBook Airs because right now, really the only really great ultra
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.960]   book out there is the MacBook Air.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.680]   There's so many expenses and convenience with going with a Windows-based ultra book.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.920]   Now a lot of the stuff that needs to, a lot of real careful and integrated engineering
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.560]   to make work on the MacBook Air is really integrated all inside this one next generation
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.560]   Intel chip.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.160]   So it's going to make a lot of things work better if Apple continues to embrace this platform,
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.440]   they're going to get the same benefits everybody else does.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.720]   So let's see if it keeps the MacBook Air still one leap ahead because they'll have the great
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.240]   CPU plus all the Coraline engineering that goes into all the other components.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.560]   The Haswell's integrated graphics according to Intel will be about 200% faster than the
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.520]   last generation HD 4000 graphics.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.000]   That's going to help with retina.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.200]   There is a better mobile chip for power consumption considerably better according to Intel.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.040]   But do you think it will be enough?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.860]   This article at Cultimax says it will be powerful enough to drive a retina display but the battery
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.360]   life is going to be the issue.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.240]   Yeah, I think for a wild lease your choice is going to be a fantastic MacBook Air which
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.560]   already has pretty good resolution or a retina MacBook.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.880]   The reason the retina MacBook Pro 13 inch is bigger and thicker than the MacBook Air is
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.840]   because of the processor and the stuff that they have inside it.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.560]   And if you start to put all that MacBook Air the MacBook Air has to start looking like
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.640]   the retina MacBook 13.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.920]   And cooling is another issue too.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.360]   So you need to actually physical space get more air moving across the circuitry.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:35.240]   So we'll get better retina MacBook Pro's Leo which I'm waiting for because when I press
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.160]   the expose button now I can count to three or four before it moves.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.640]   You sometimes feel as though you're actually holding down the shift key as you're moving
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   these moves.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.960]   Like, oh, nope, that's just how fast things go.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.960]   Okay.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.480]   Yeah, it's maxing out the current Intel HD graphics GPU and the next one hopefully will
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.840]   give it a lot of breathing room.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.000]   It's almost like every time Apple goes to retina that first generation pays this retina
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.120]   overhead tax where the chipset can just barely keep up.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.400]   And then when it goes to the next generation it can start doing in second gear what it
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.960]   used to have to do flat out in five and then it's just a much better experience.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.640]   I think it's unfortunate that users don't have that option of going with just a normal
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.000]   display that doesn't have performance issues.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.680]   It is a huge boon to having that extra detail when you're doing all kinds of different production
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.440]   stuff but I don't know.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.560]   I wish it were an option as opposed to nope this is what the pro is from Ellen.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.400]   So what should I buy?
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.240]   Should I okay well I guess I'll know when this happens is this going to happen at WWDCs
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.280]   are going to happen June 7th?
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.680]   The 15 inch retinomacbo pro debut at WWDC last year's and Apple typically has some sort
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.560]   of hardware analysis.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.560]   But once the power user product.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.840]   So if as well as ready and Apple's had time to integrate and everything's working great
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.360]   and they can and as Apple announces when they can ship within a relatively short period
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   of time.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.840]   Usually they when a new chipset comes out Apple is one of the first if not the first
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.680]   company to use it right?
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.480]   From Intel they seem to have the inside track within Dell.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.240]   Apple also I mean that's why Apple got IPS panels in the iMac before anybody else they
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.000]   buy you know one set of things in huge quantities a lot of other manufacturers buy a few of
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.520]   these and a few of those and none of them are in tremendous scale and it lets Apple
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.560]   buy things that you know cheaply enough to get the economies of scale to do it all in
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.200]   one shot very quickly.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.440]   Apple's has spoiled me unfortunately.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.600]   I've ruined you Leo.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.440]   They ruined me with retina.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.800]   And so while I want the lightness of air and I would love to see have you know quad core
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:37.040]   i7 air which would be amazingly fast great graphics I kind of want the high res.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.720]   And the thing is in my opinion it's the MacBook Airs that need retina most of all.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.600]   I love the 11 inch air but I had one for a couple months to test out.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.360]   It's just I it's just too cramped it's not it's not as though the screen is unreadable
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.160]   but I really for unusual for an Apple device I feel the fact that this is a sub optimal
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.800]   display performance for this type of size display and that's why if I were to buy one
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.000]   I would probably go with a 13 inch I might even wish that I'd gotten it a thicker 15
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   inch.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.600]   I actually had an 11 and I ended up getting a 13 instead and I bought their 15 inch retina
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.160]   last year at WWW you know after WWDC because I and I and I love it.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.760]   Yeah I don't I I'm I'm I'm pleased with people who say that once they start using a retina
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.120]   they can't possibly go back I had no problem going back after I sent my loaner back but
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.400]   yeah but but if you're doing things like aperture and you realize that oh I've not
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.000]   I've this is the hundredth photo that I've edited and I have not zoomed in even once because
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.440]   there's no need to zoom in I see so much detail there that it really does spoil you.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.840]   Yeah it's nice.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.600]   How about touch?
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600]   No.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:48.960]   I kind of like I okay so I'm not a fan as you probably gathered of Windows 8 but I do
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.880]   really like touching the screen I think that there's times when you want to maybe not
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.960]   on a desktop when on a laptop you want to reach out and touch it.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.480]   I think that's inevitable.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.520]   I don't know that there's any time frame for it but I think it's inevitable that you'll
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.360]   see Mac notebooks and Mac desktops have touch screens because I mean everybody I'm sure
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.040]   almost everybody here and everybody listening to this has had that experience where they've
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.400]   come in from the car after using their iPhone and they the first thing they do when they
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.040]   want to when they want to activate a window on their iMac is actually start touching the
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   screen.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.840]   This is when when kids define their first experiences with computers our first experiences were
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.280]   with keyboards to be a little bit younger than us for your first experience to be a keyboard
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.200]   and a mouse and that was it for 20 years but now we've got whole generations of kids who
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.160]   are growing up thinking about touch screens so it's not that they it's not that it's impossible
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.240]   to do a good experience but it's not that it's impossible to do a good experience that
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.760]   way but I think that the argument that people don't want to operate their computers like
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.400]   this is kind of uninformed it's not that people want to spend three hours doing this
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.560]   but they do want to when they're just sort of occasionally like their hands are off the
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.600]   keyboard they're just sort of futzing around they do occasionally want to do this to do
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.720]   something rather than going center my key center my hands of the people are natural and
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.120]   I'm so used to it and I think I'm probably a natural book I do it here has not now because
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.920]   of using an iPad touched at one point or another their Mac book screen thinking it's going to
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   do something.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.120]   Yeah besides you know get a weird smudge.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.160]   It's a little bit like I think Apple's attitude towards touch screen on desktop machines it's
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.320]   a little bit like people using the word literally in the wrong context you can say you can say
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.280]   it's wrong you can say it makes no sense but that's how everybody's talking now and so
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.840]   you can either be the one person who I'm sorry it's grammatically incorrect to have a touch
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.440]   screen I'm tomato is not a vegetable and a spider's not insect.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.280]   And I'm not sure when this is it probably I'm thinking it's 1998.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.560]   Chad just stuck this in the rundown I love this it's from thinking bricks.com this guy
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:59.880]   had a high 8 camcorder when Steve Jobs introduced the first Mac book with why he's picking it
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   up.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:09.360]   Walking away standing ovation as Steve uses his Mac book.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.360]   That was.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.760]   Yeah and the crowd just starts to realize it more and more and they get more and more
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.440]   excited and yeah they just all start freaking out.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:26.800]   This is really good to see because we take this step so for granted 15 years ago.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.240]   He's using a whole loop to show no wires.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.040]   It is a magic trick.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.040]   We take this stuff for granted it's really nice to see this once in a while.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.880]   And you know he felt pretty good having a life.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.480]   I mean you can you can see a little tracking markers on the corners of the screen where
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:51.080]   they could match the video to that I mean you're so gullible back.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.600]   Anyway I look forward to seeing what they have next month.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:01.040]   I was about I literally was about to push this buy button on a 13 inch Mac book air and then
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.520]   I said wait a minute has well.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.480]   So wait it's certainly I think it's worth waiting.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.600]   I agree anybody who's thinking about buying a buying a new notebook right now who can possibly
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.560]   wait for the next generation or hardware even if it does have to wait until January I don't
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.200]   think it'll be that long but that's how that's how big an improvement this new next generation
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.440]   of chips is going to be.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:24.440]   And by the way I somebody saying this in the chat room and I agree I miss Steve Jobs there
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.200]   the keynotes will never be there.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:31.400]   No one will ever be that good again when you see the horrid things that Samsung's been
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:38.360]   doing lately and you know it's just I mean we really have a great story for you about
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   that.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.040]   That's great yeah private huh.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   Yes.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   Here's another video for you I don't is this is from pop cap.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.680]   Hey guys this is me Francis this video is going out to the guys to make the game plans
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.760]   versus zombies.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.720]   Are you guys making a sequel?
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.720]   You are making a sequel.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720]   Are you not?
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.960]   When this new game is coming up it seems like it's about time.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.800]   Wouldn't most decent video games have a sequel out by now right?
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.720]   Really how much longer could it possibly to.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.520]   Where is my plants versus zombie sequel I need it.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.520]   I'm tired of waiting.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.520]   Come on you guys.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.520]   You're taking so long.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.880]   I need more plants.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.160]   I need more zombie.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.160]   Can't move by killing some of them.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.800]   There is still no sequel to plants versus zombies.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.200]   Release the game pop cap.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   Plants versus zombies too.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.200]   I.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.600]   I plants versus zombies versus dude.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.520]   Doesn't matter.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.320]   Plants versus zombies forever is going to be the name of it.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.880]   No I am just dying to get the sequel.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.240]   They were giving away.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.760]   I think they still are plants versus zombies one.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.320]   Everybody thought that's the signal you're going to be able to get the greatest in my
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.560]   opinion.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.600]   The greatest iPad game and iPhone somewhat of all time.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.880]   And now they're saying July.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.840]   Just in time for my new MacBook Air with Retina display.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.680]   Awesome.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.600]   Lightroom for the iPad we saw.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.440]   Weird demo on Scott Kelby's podcast.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.520]   His Lightroom podcast.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.440]   Apparently he had an Adobe rep on who kind of went off the reservation and started showing
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.920]   a very funky prototype.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.760]   He was doing an iPad too which is even funkier.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.680]   Tom Hoegerty who is the group product manager for Lightroom said I'm not going to tell you
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.480]   when it's going to ship or what it'll do.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:46.280]   But I do have something I can show you and raw photo format support which is something
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280]   awesome.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:54.400]   No iPad app currently has that for good reason because for instance raw on my Canon 5D is
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.760]   about 21 megabytes per image.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.360]   I photo won't do it.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.480]   Cloud synchronized editing so if you're using Lightroom on a desktop your changes on the
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.560]   tablet go right to the desktop.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.040]   100% zoom.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.520]   I'd love to see it.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.000]   But this demo is not.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.040]   This is the grid Scott says show the grid.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.920]   This demo is not going to impress anybody.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.320]   For instance all the telemetry on the that's what that green stuff is debugging info.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.120]   Yes.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.960]   I gave the statement from Adobe that I can use.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:32.520]   God is details on availability.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.160]   In regards to Tom Hoegerty please know this was a sneak peek look at future technologies
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.800]   and not specific product plans or nudes.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.160]   I think he went off the reservation frankly.
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.160]   That's okay.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.000]   That's good.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   That's quite useful too.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.760]   One of the great things about the new Lightroom beta is that it tries to make it not important
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.080]   what device and what location you're using to edit your photos with because it makes
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.320]   very very portable previews of everything you're doing.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.400]   So if you were to take your MacBook Air away from your desktop and do editing for a few
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.440]   days and then come back it would go back to right where you were and apply all the changes
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.360]   you'd made to those previews to your hard drive version of the library.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.360]   So it's certainly not unimaginable that they could do something on the iPad that would give
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.200]   you exactly that sort of functionality.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.880]   There's a program called PhotoSmith on the iPad that we'll kind of sync.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.640]   And I'll tell you there's something very natural about editing or at least picking photos and
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.320]   doing some basic editing on an iPad.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.720]   It's just so natural and you're traveling.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.720]   I did it when I was in Norway a year ago with iPhoto.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.720]   I wasn't working with Ros.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.520]   It just feels good doesn't it?
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:41.320]   Yeah, I think the iPad is the ultimate device for triage that I love it to be able to dump
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.400]   my card into there, erase the card and then use that to the good, bad, good, bad, keep
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.800]   throughout, keep, keep throughout, throughout, throughout.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.800]   Because you're looking at essentially an 8x10 color glossy photograph of each one of these
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   things.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.720]   There's no better way to figure out what's worth keeping and what needs to be gotten rid
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.720]   of.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.960]   And even if it can't edit raw it will at least import the raw and keep it there so that when
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.880]   you dock your iPad next the next time you can at least get all those pictures off of the
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.000]   camera roll and into your desktop library.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.760]   So I can't believe we haven't seen a good raw editor yet for such a natural.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.360]   As soon as Apple makes a 128 gigabyte iPad, I mean you need the, you're going to need
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   a lot of storage.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.000]   I guess you're going to work with a 32 gig card and you just, and that's the one card
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.200]   you're going to use, you're probably all right.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.400]   But as soon as you have two cards and then you, that's all bets are off.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.000]   Renee Richie, I said we do a rumor update.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   I don't even know.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.800]   Are there any good new rumors we haven't mentioned yet?
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.720]   I mean, it's the same rumors.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:48.880]   We've got the low, the less expensive iPhone, the larger screen iPhone, the iWatch.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.840]   I'm starting to think the iWatch is not real.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.840]   It's real.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840]   It just hasn't been turned into a product yet.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   Apple does tie.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.920]   If you can think of a product that Apple, you know, might be experimenting with, they
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.680]   probably do have it in a lab somewhere and some of them never leave the lab and some
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.920]   of them do leave the lab and get tossed around for the while.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.840]   And some of those get made into products.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.960]   And it sounds like the iWatch is in that stage, but it doesn't sound like it's, you're
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.840]   not going to see it at WWDC on social or shiny risk.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.720]   I wonder if you're ever going to see it.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.720]   It depends on how the variables market goes.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720]   That's absolutely correct.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.360]   I mean, the one of the, one of the first really exciting pictures I'd ever been shown
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:29.120]   that I wasn't allowed to just show with anybody, but to show anybody was an LCD tablet running
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.960]   Mac OS like I think was even Mac OS eight.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960]   This is how old it is.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:39.120]   They basically took some sharp OEM hardware and ported and ported Mac OS over to it.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.600]   And it was like, it probably didn't work very well.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.600]   They probably figure out there wasn't much of a market for it.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.520]   But like when he says, they designed so many things.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:50.200]   They built so many things just to see how it would work and to be ready if the market
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   was ever ready for it.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   Right.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:56.240]   That's why you always, this is, I think I'm saying something that probably all four of
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.080]   us wind up saying at family weddings and other places a lot.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.680]   They probably are working on it.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.280]   We don't know whether they're going to actually ship it or not because they have the wherewithal
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.080]   to explore pretty much every option.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   Right.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   Hey, I'm super excited.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.920]   I want to say really quickly, I'm super excited about where a bull's bed.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.040]   I don't know if I believe that the watch is what that's going to be.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.360]   I think a lot of people are going to pursue it.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.800]   A lot of other companies maybe.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:23.520]   I think glasses are better than a watch for this particular application.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.880]   If we can get over the part of looking stupid, then yes.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.360]   That's kind of the problem.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.080]   People are willing to wear watches because you're used to seeing those things.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.640]   I don't know if people are willing to, I think you could talk people into wearing them as
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.920]   sort of a special device for here is a situation which you would want to wear these as opposed
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.440]   to use any other electronic device.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:45.240]   But this is the place where you're going to find wearables, not on your face.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.240]   I don't know.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.000]   Google Glass makes so much sense.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.880]   I got to finally try it with Scoble on Sunday.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:57.360]   It just makes so much sense because you're already looking and you just look up and it's
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   there.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.080]   You're right.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.760]   You look like a dork.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.160]   There are definitely some problems with it.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.760]   It gave me a headache.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.760]   I didn't wear it that long, but I do think that that's a more natural place.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.600]   It's hard to, how much real estate are you allowed to consume on the wrist?
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.080]   Not a lot.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.720]   I have a pebble and it's kind of fun, but I wouldn't wear it every day.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   Still haven't got my pebble.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.760]   I bought it the day that they put it on Kickstarter.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.840]   It shipped like a month ago.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   I still haven't got it.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840]   No, I know.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.840]   Do you get the color one?
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:27.840]   No, the black one.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.880]   Oh, they sent me an ad saying we're having trouble with red, which they now have.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.280]   Would you like the black instead?
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.080]   And I said, yes.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.640]   It's not, it's by the time you get it, it'll be like the eye watch first.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.800]   They're adding apps.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.600]   They're going to have a golf range finder now and they eventually will have those, you
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.000]   know, pedometer apps and all of that stuff.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.800]   I just, I feel like the watch and it's thick and I just don't know how you make it a big
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.720]   enough display that it's useful.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720]   It's not touch.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.360]   Well, this is the sort of thing that Apple does really, really well remember.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.960]   I mean, look at, think about it.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.880]   I think back to all the rumors that were around about Apple making a phone and nobody
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.760]   was able to guess even though, even though we had seen touchscreen phones before, even
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.600]   though we knew the technology existed, no one could really figure out that they would
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.840]   articulate a phone in that way.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.960]   So that's why I'm excited about the idea of an Apple watch.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.160]   I'd like to see them do a wearable computer that is as far removed from anything we can
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.480]   imagine as the iPhone was from what everything we could imagine back in 2006.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   Yes, I agree.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.240]   Yeah, but everybody likens it to the Dick Tracy watch though, which they were envisioning
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240]   in the 1930s.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.480]   So I'm not sure that I'm not sure that that's the kind of imagination that we're talking
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.480]   about.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   They're going to.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   Can Apple do something interesting?
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.840]   If they can do a watch that has lightning bolts coming out of it in the little caption
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.680]   two way wrist radio every time we use it hovering over it, that's a hundred bucks I'm
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.680]   willing to spend.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.680]   That would be cool.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:55.440]   The thing like in one of the bad Star Wars movies, I think it was whatever the third one
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.440]   was called.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.080]   You know, they just hold that thing up and there's a little hologram for right there.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.760]   Well, also remember that Linda Calrissian had a risk computer for talking to Lobod
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.280]   and it powers right back.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.080]   That's how well he was wearing the prototype of Google Glass.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   Exactly.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.880]   But I do see what you're talking about though because last week I showed you those Sony
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.400]   digital binoculars that I'm testing out.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.560]   And I've been using them.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.360]   I went to a ball game Thursday night with them.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.840]   I spent the entire day Sunday in the park with them.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.320]   And there's something without talking about this specific product, there's something about
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.240]   the idea of having being able to look at something while you're taking pictures of it
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.120]   and why you're capturing video of it.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.280]   Because normally with a camera, you have to choose one or the other.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.240]   It's like, I can be shooting video, but I have to look at the screen or be happy with
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.640]   the fact that I don't know exactly where I'm going to be aiming this.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.000]   If you have Google Glass, it's the ability to participate and observe while still being
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.720]   able to take a picture of it.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.800]   And I know that's just one feature of it, but if that's a feature that communicates to
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.640]   people, I mean, I don't know a whole lot of people who've tried Glass at this point,
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.080]   but I don't know anybody who didn't come away thinking, "Well, this is pretty cool.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.680]   I don't know if I'll be buying it, but all of a sudden, that was pretty cool."
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.720]   I got to tell you about how cool this was.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.360]   We all have so much faith in Apple and that, yeah, they'll crack it.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.160]   But I haven't had that faith in a while and I don't know if they'll crack it.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.000]   And I think it's pretty hard to figure out how.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.520]   Remember when we were talking about the iPad and everybody said, "Oh, we've seen tablets.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.320]   It's not, it's terrible."
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.600]   And we just kind of knew at the time, you know, Apple might have a way to do it.
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.600]   They'd make this work.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.600]   There's some magic, some mojo.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.920]   Mashed it and it was just a big iPod touch.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.920]   Right.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   But it wasn't.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.680]   In some weird way, it wasn't.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.080]   Glass feels a little more like that.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.280]   Glass is like, "Well, you know, actually, you know, this is kind of there's something
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.280]   there.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.000]   It's not quite there, but there's something there.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.440]   I don't, I have a hard time thinking of what you could do with a wristwatch."
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.040]   It's like the Apple One or the Lisa of wearables.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.520]   Well, that's what some, yeah, that's what, I think it was Tim Stevens.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.160]   Maybe it was Scoble who said that, that it was the Apple Two.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160]   It was Scoble said.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.400]   What if they were felt the same way it did about the Apple Two?
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.000]   You couldn't do anything really with the Apple Two, but you knew this is the beginning
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   of something big.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.040]   But what if Apple were to do this the same way they did Apple TV, where they knew that
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:22.520]   this was not something that people were necessarily ready for, but it was, but they were ready
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.840]   to sell it and ready to start showing it.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.320]   And aware that they would get a lot of information from the people who were buying it and how
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.880]   they would actually be using it.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.280]   What if they created a watch then?
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.400]   They openly said it's another hobby for us and set the expectations thusly and said that
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.640]   this is going to be a $250 device.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.880]   It only does these four things, but it does those four things extremely well.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.200]   It's the wristwatch that we at Apple want to wear.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.800]   And for the first two years of this device, they would never, they don't refer to it as
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.960]   a computer even once.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.800]   They always refer to it as a wristwatch.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.240]   That could be an interesting way for them to do a watch and not feel as though, if they
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:07.360]   were, the stock price is going to dip below God forbid, 350 after the announcement.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.160]   Only difficult part about that is it's not the same world that Apple introduced the original
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   Apple TV.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.960]   I mean, Apple, I mean, look at all the rumors about the watches.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.440]   Now, every other company saying, well, we're getting into watches too, as if anybody has
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.120]   actually said that Apple is getting into a watch.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:24.360]   I know, I mean, it probably is a real thing and it really is happening someplace.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:30.000]   But people are starting to move on the wristwatch idea as if Apple has announced something.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.960]   And even if Apple tried to downplay expectations, it's when did the Apple TV come out?
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.960]   Do your original ones?
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   2007.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.520]   Yeah, it's not 2007.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.920]   I mean, Apple can't.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.720]   If Apple came out with the iPod high-fi today.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.280]   Well, that was a bad product.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.120]   Well, it wasn't bad product, but it was a bad product that went largely unnoticed.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.960]   People like us went and said, really?
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   You got people.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   And it has new jobs.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:56.960]   It had Steve jobs.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:04.840]   I mean, I don't know that they could introduce expectations low enough to not rock the world,
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.920]   because everybody is expecting something a thousand times better than the Dick Tracey
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.920]   watch at this point.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.960]   So even if you said seriously, guys, this is not that big a deal.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.400]   People are still going to come out and say, Suggs.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.320]   One difference though is that if they keep selling it as a watch, realize that there
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:24.760]   are people who will happily spend $3,000 for a really cool watch, because it's not only
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:29.200]   a functional piece of technology, it is actually something that they enjoy as a fashion thing.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.200]   That's jewelry.
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.200]   And they...
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:35.480]   Well, but yeah, but I think Apple could have the wherewithal to simply have functions
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.800]   that really, really work incredibly well and be selling it as here is a fashion thing that's
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   going to...
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.800]   This is not a $2,000 watch.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   I buy that.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   $200 watch.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800]   And also...
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   And there's also the possibility, and this is...
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.800]   I mean, the fun of talking about the watch is that we can all just sort of spitball things.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.560]   And the fun of this... and what's interesting is that Samsung will probably rush a watch
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.800]   to market and will be horrible.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:58.800]   Other companies...
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.800]   Right.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.800]   People will do a watch.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:04.560]   They'll continue to improve it, but it won't have the sort of awareness that anybody will
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.960]   look at your wrist and know what your... what it is that you're wearing.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.480]   Apple can do this and simply say, it's a wristwatch.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.600]   It has exactly two functions to it, but it is the coolest $200 watch we think that you
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.800]   can possibly get, and they can actually sell that.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.080]   And they can continue to sort of add features to it and add features to it.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.160]   If it just does those two things, and unlike the Samsung watch, does those two things so
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.960]   well that you're using it all the time for telling time in those two digital functions,
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.400]   they can certainly build momentum off of that, I think.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.880]   You actually said something that triggered me, because I imagine it to be clunky and ugly,
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:43.160]   kind of like the pebble thick with the day's battery life and kind of an ugly display.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.400]   What if Apple does exactly the opposite and makes it a beautiful piece of jewelry that
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:51.800]   has maybe limited functionality, but it's still a gorgeous watch?
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.600]   That I'd be interested in.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.400]   I just don't want a clunky thing on my wrist.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.240]   Apple does two kinds of products traditionally, and one is exactly the Apple TV, which enhances
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.480]   their ecosystem and makes their main products more valuable.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:07.120]   You can make a watch like that that shows you Siri cards or does a bunch of other things
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.320]   that makes the stuff you already have, like your iPhone and iPad more valuable, or they
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.760]   have products, which is like the iPhone, which is expected to sell in the hundreds of millions
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.120]   and be a leg in their entire business.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.360]   It seems like a watch no matter what they do with it, given the constraints of current
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:26.280]   technology is going to be exactly like Andy said, more like the hobby.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:32.040]   When rumors of the iPad came out, Microsoft couldn't wait to show off the HP slate at
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:35.120]   CES, just to sort of prepend that argument.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.320]   When the iPhone was going to be a thing, people couldn't wait to show off their phones, and
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.760]   that's always going to happen.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.280]   We had Google TV with 900 button controllers since the Apple TV launched.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.480]   I don't think Apple cares so much about that as in producing that product that does those
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.960]   two things and gets people in the door with whatever they think is going to be a market.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:59.360]   If not today, it'll be that Tim Cook pulling on the thread for the future.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.360]   Now I'm suddenly intrigued.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.680]   If it's a good piece of jewelry, I might buy it.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:08.840]   I don't want the Casio calculator to watch that a little tiny stylus so that you could
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.840]   type the numbers in.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.840]   I'm afraid it's that.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.600]   I don't want anything that geeky.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.480]   I want one that plays Epoch Man.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.040]   You can play Snake on the pebble.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.160]   It's really hard because it's so tiny.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.360]   I could barely play that on the G1.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360]   Press up to start.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.360]   Witch up.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.120]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.960]   Our picks of the week, Renee Richie from iMore, Mac OS Ken and the Inako from the Chicago
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.960]   Sun Times.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   I'm Lee Oldelport.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.520]   Thank you by gazelle.com.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.940]   It's true when it's time to get the new gadget you've got to.
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:49.820]   Most of us just end up throwing the old gadget in a drawer where it collects dust.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.240]   You've got to take advantage of gazelle.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:58.720]   You can get a quote right now on your old cell phone or iPad or MacBook or Mac or iPod
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.280]   or tablet or your iPad.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.880]   You can get a quote right now that's good for 30 days.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:08.560]   And when that new tablet comes out, you'll be sitting pretty.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.440]   They have expanded a little bit the number of tablets they'll take Asus Google.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.480]   I just wonder what a Windows.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.000]   Apparently, Windows Surface RT tablet.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.800]   See how much I could get for my RT.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.280]   Let's see.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.640]   Wi-Fi.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.320]   I got the 64 gig.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.320]   Let's get an offer.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.320]   It's in good condition.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.320]   I'm just curious.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.920]   I just, yes, I have all of the, I have a touch type cover.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.920]   I have the power supply.
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.280]   Calculate.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.720]   I paid 500 bucks.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.880]   I get 250 back.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.880]   That's a good deal.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   Now here's the best part.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.640]   They'll pay the postage on anything worth more than a bucks.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.680]   You throw that in the box and find some more old stuff to give them.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:51.120]   How about you've got an old Samsung Galaxy S3?
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.480]   You think maybe I'm going to get rid of that for the next iPhone.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.680]   You just pick it out of here.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:01.440]   You get the, you get to say what the condition is and it's in and you get your quote.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.960]   Now when you send it, they'll remove the data from it.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:04.960]   They pay the postage.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.000]   In fact, they send you a box you can throw it into.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.800]   They remove the data from it and they will adjust your quote up if it's in better shape
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.280]   than you thought it was.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.560]   Right now you get an extra $10 for your iPhone 4s.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.080]   Take advantage of that.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.920]   Again, their quote is good for 30 days.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.720]   That means you can get the quote.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.400]   Now it's not going to, I can tell you right now this is the most it's worth.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.400]   Look at that.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.880]   iPhone 4, 16 gigs, 150 bucks.
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:31.880]   This is a great deal.

[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.440]   Do it.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:01.200]   All right, time for our tips and picks of the week.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.200]   Let's start with Andy and Akko.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.040]   What do you got for us?
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.640]   Kind of a side thing.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:11.560]   Some of you are familiar with Jonathan Colton and Greg Pak, team me together to do a Kickstarter
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.360]   project, a comic based on code monkey save world.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.640]   Code monkey is his song.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.520]   Code monkey save world has blown through all of its goals.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.480]   They're seeking $39,000.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.000]   They're up now up to $240,000.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.200]   They have expanded it to like 90 pages, including all kinds of all kinds of bonus stuff.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:37.520]   They have added a new stretch goal that is worthy of a second comment.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:45.960]   It now if they exceed $250,000, they will do a children's book based on the princess
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.880]   who saved herself, which is another really it's a song that Joko wrote for Haitian relief
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.480]   a while ago.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.960]   And it is exactly the story is about the title that you've based in based in the side of
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.960]   the title.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.600]   It is about a princess who sort of breaks through every single expectation of a children's
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:07.080]   story and just basically forms a rock band and say, say, it takes control of everything
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.360]   that needs to be done on itself.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.720]   And you get that plus code monkey save world as digital downloads with a $15 pledge.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:24.360]   So I originally backed at the $3 level, but I happily bumped that up to 15.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.200]   Actually no, I was already at the I was already high level.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.520]   But yeah, this is a good excuse if you're not familiar with this too.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.720]   I think that's going to be $15 with the comics, $15 with entertainment happily happily happily
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.720]   happily.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.880]   And we just love Colton and we just want to support him.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.760]   And I like style is good.
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.480]   I really like how this stuff looks.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.400]   Actually, that's not his art.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.520]   Oh, he is a but he is an artist.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:53.600]   He is a writer of some renowned he did a transforming run on the incredible Hulk at Marvel.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:00.640]   He does it and he was the first writer, I think, that really got me into the X men after,
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.360]   you know, 80 years of reading these comics and not understanding anything and not liking
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360]   anything.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.480]   His his his run is the first one that really, really enjoyed.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.280]   So that's another name to know if you want to get into comics.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.920]   But the fact that the fact that he's writing this and to catch you me as I while you're
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.200]   right, the the art is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.200]   great.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.240]   If you scroll down the artwork on the children's book, looks like some be fantastic.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.840]   If they they interviewed both of them the other day about the project and hopefully it'll
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.360]   make so much money that they will consider printing copies of this children's book because
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.080]   this seems like the sort of thing that you would like to, you know, sort of give away
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.440]   as gifts for people.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.400]   Oh, so this this will all be digital.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.400]   These were there they're printing a trade paperbacks and digital downloads of code monkey
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.400]   save world.
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.400]   Okay.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:48.200]   The stretch goal is right now it's set as a digital download.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.520]   They're considered having announced it, but they're considering if it does super well
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.840]   that they will do printed copies of it as well.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.840]   Awesome.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.000]   So if you don't, if you don't back the, if you don't back the project then it will also
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.200]   be available, I think through comicsology for a regular purchase, but don't you want
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.200]   to be one of the cool kids who back the project and set up just to put to put on your scruffy
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.920]   beard and your fixie and say that, amen, I was into this way before we hit console.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.120]   For $50 you get coffee buck book music bundle.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:21.880]   You get the whole kitten kaboodle plus the digital downloads plus the soundtrack of the
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.120]   Colton songs inspired the book.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.960]   I mean, there's some really cool bonuses here.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:34.400]   The more you put in because challenge coins, code monkey challenge coins.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.840]   You can get the resin statue, the painted statue.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.760]   I think there's even a, is there a concert one?
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:45.600]   I think for $10,000 you will get an event with Greg and Jonathan at your at your store
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.920]   or university or probably your living room for, I mean, if I had my $10,000 gift card
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.520]   for my two, I would probably spend it on getting, having those two come and come from my house
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.520]   party.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.760]   That would be a well, that would be money well spent.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:02.040]   They are so smart because this is a, this is a well done Kickstarter project.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:07.520]   Just look at the various awards and you'll see this is how you do a Kickstarter project.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.600]   Yeah, plus, I mean, I think I think it was guaranteed to reach its goal when you, you
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.320]   know, Jonathan Colton's fans, they come out and they come out with her wallets open.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.840]   So I'm glad that this was funded like as quickly as it was.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.560]   I'm glad there's so many bonuses coming out.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.040]   Yeah, look at all these.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.040]   Wow.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.520]   Now I can't, I have to shop a little bit.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   I'm to look at all the different levels.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.720]   I really want those challenge coins.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.560]   I look, I'm in the challenge coins all of a sudden.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.600]   Mac OS Ken, you got to pick for us?
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.720]   I have something that I'm excited about.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.280]   That's all I care about.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.520]   I can't really call it a pick yet, unfortunately, because I haven't read it, but I was just,
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.480]   just yesterday I was looking at a camera, I came across it in my news feed.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:49.800]   And John Lanier has a new book, Who Owns the Future?
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:55.400]   Yeah, it's so funny because I just sent that press release to our producer to get Jiren
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.400]   on triangulation.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:57.400]   Oh, very cool.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.040]   This is very interesting.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.040]   Tell us about it.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.520]   Well, I can't tell you much about it because I haven't read it yet.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.520]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.760]   But I mean, Jiren's become a naysayer to technology.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.440]   He's always kind of been, hasn't he?
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.920]   I mean, it's, he's a weird guy.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.560]   I mean, you've interviewed him before.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560]   Yes.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.560]   I interviewed him.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.960]   Yeah, I interviewed him at York Street.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:22.560]   Is that where the studio used to be?
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560]   I interviewed him at York Street for radio back in the day.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.760]   And he's a little cantankerous, but he is a big thinker and he's somebody, you know,
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.520]   like he may have been there for big thinkers.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.520]   No, they think about it.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.080]   He was famous for virtual reality.
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.080]   Yes.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.440]   He was the first to really talk about what basically the Oculus Rift now does.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.360]   And that was actually, I first saw him in '89.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.000]   He came to a mass college of art and blew my mind.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.640]   And in front of my husband the rest of the day talking about how this could be both the
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.000]   best thing and the worst thing in the world.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.360]   And of course, it turns out it kind of didn't happen the way anybody thought it was going
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360]   to.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.560]   But anyway, like, so this past weekend on day six, I mentioned earlier all those people
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.720]   that we talked to, that was a large part of the conversation that we were talking about
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.360]   is who gets to decide what the future is going to be.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.760]   And so then to find out that when you hear his already, you know, I mean, that he's written
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.360]   a book about it, I'm kind of curious.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:17.160]   I don't, you know, every big thing or like that, you don't necessarily agree with everything
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.200]   that you say, but I am interested to hear what he says.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.240]   So it's available as an ebook all over the place.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.880]   And I assume in bookstores that you have any left.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.120]   Who owns the future?
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:32.240]   It says follow up to his book from two years ago, "You are not a gadget."
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.000]   Which also was prickly.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.360]   Very interesting stuff.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:43.160]   If you're one of those people who says, as he does, that Google is a little too intrusive,
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.000]   that Facebook is a little too manipulative.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.160]   You should read this.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.160]   Good recommendation.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.160]   Thank you, Ken.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.600]   What do you have for us, Renee?
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.960]   So I was in New York all last week and part of what we were doing was a lot of videos
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.920]   and photos and we had a videographer and a photographer with us named Safe Solvent.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.640]   That's his Instagram name anyway.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.480]   And whenever we have an expert, I always like to find out what apps they're using.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.720]   He was an iPhone user and he was always taking Instagram photos.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.280]   And he turned me on to this app called KitCam.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:17.000]   And it's basically there's a lot of great photography apps on the iPhone because the
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000]   iPhone has a great camera and there's Snapseed, there's Instagram.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.440]   But what I liked about this is I put a lot of really good stuff all in one place.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:30.240]   So you can take a photo, they have live filters for different lenses and for different films.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.200]   But it also has a bunch of post-process editing tools and you can go into levels and white
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.920]   balance and it does it for both video and for still photos.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:44.040]   And it's just such a wealth of tools that I got a lot of what I usually do over several
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.440]   apps done in just one app.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:52.240]   And then it also easily lets you share that out whether it's to Instagram, like everyone
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.120]   likes to do these days or an FTP site or to another app.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.840]   And it just the convenience of it along with the care that it looks like they put into
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:03.040]   it just sold me on it immediately.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.040]   Wow.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.040]   Wow, it's beautiful.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.040]   Look at that.
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.520]   Yeah, it does some really cool stuff.
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.120]   I love the live effects too.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.200]   Take advantage of that processor in there.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.480]   I don't know if it still is.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.560]   It was on sale for 99 cents when I bought it earlier this week.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.560]   It might still be.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.280]   And there's some in-app purchases for additional film and lens packs and they're all well worth
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.280]   it and my experience.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:25.280]   What's it?
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.280]   What's it called again?
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.280]   KitCam, K-I-T-C-A-M.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.280]   C-A-M.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.720]   Thank you.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.720]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:34.480]   Ritchie.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:41.600]   Our show today is done, but you can go home knowing you know everything there is to know
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:48.000]   now about the Macintosh, all the rumors, all the facts, what it really means.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.200]   Thanks to these guys right here.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.840]   Mac OS Ken Kenray.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:53.120]   It's great to have you on always.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.120]   MacOSKen.squarespace.com is the new site.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.560]   Actually, if you go to MacOSKen.com, it just redirects.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.560]   Easier.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.560]   Yes.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.560]   And more fun.
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.120]   Ten times the fun.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120]   Thank you, Ken.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.120]   Great to have you once again.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.120]   Thank you.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.120]   Thanks to Renee Ritchie.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.120]   Imore.com.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.720]   That's where you should go.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.320]   If you want to find out what's going on, crackberry.com too.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320]   If you're-
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:17.080]   I'll be at Blackberry Live with them all next week.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.120]   I'll be broadcasting live from the Crackberry booth I hope next week.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.880]   Well, that should be interesting.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.840]   I'll be curious with the spirit, how people feel at Blackberry Live.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.400]   You'll see me surrounded by Black and Orange Leo.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:29.880]   Wow.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.480]   Where is that event this year?
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480]   Orlando.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480]   All right.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.440]   Sort of last year, they had Blackberry World and Blackberry Jam and it was two events.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.240]   And I think this year it's all one big Blackberry Live event.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.240]   Jammed together.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240]   Yep.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.240]   Cool.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.240]   Well, next week we'll talk to you about the future of Blackberry.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240]   Sorry.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.240]   Try not to-
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.240]   He's Canadian.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.680]   He has to like it.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.680]   It's in our contract.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.680]   It's in the contract.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.560]   When you sign up to be a Canadian.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.160]   Thanks to Andy and I go to Chicago Sun.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.960]   Times, what you up to these days, Andy?
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.200]   Anything exciting you want to tell us about?
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:04.440]   A couple of top secret projects that hopefully will come to fruition soon.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:11.040]   But now, but to look forward to that, that, that, the docular review, it is, if nothing,
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:15.040]   it's getting me out of the house and getting me exposed to sun tomorrow morning.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.960]   Early in the morning, I'm going birding with somebody.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.000]   I've never been birding before, but I figure I got to try these binoculars out with it.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.400]   Baseball game and birding.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.560]   It's too much for one.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.040]   Baseball in the park and birding.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.640]   It's almost like I have a newly divorced dad or something.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   Dad?
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.080]   Can we go birding?
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.080]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080]   Always a pleasure.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.600]   You can also hear Andy Enacos all monack on the 5x5 network, 5x5.TV.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:46.400]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.400]   Do watch live if you can, but if you can't on demand audio and video available after the
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.120]   fact at Twit.tv/MBW.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.960]   Here's the t-shirt last few days, if you want to get in on this.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:03.040]   We do every month, we do some limited availability object.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.760]   This will no longer be available.
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.640]   Don't come crying to me next week when you said, "I wanted that t-shirt."
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:14.240]   Still available, but just for a few more days, five days and five hours left, $15.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:18.880]   You could choose from Fruit of the Loom or American Apparel.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.480]   Beautiful, nice t-shirts with a design by one of our Twit crowd folks.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:32.280]   We're just going to quit chat, just go to teespring.com/twit and you can pick that t-shirt
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.280]   up today.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.160]   Great gift for Mother's Day for all the geeky moms out there.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:41.320]   Yes, Ray DVD, we do ship to the UK, we ship anywhere in the world, but of course it's
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.800]   going to cost you more than $15 because we got to pay tariff and stuff like that.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.240]   You find out about that at twespring.com/twit.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.240]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240]   Back to work now.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.240]   Break time is over.
