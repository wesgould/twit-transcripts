[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.000]   Ooh, that sounds interesting.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.840]   And the death of the Montreal bagel.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.400]   Can it be?

[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   Hello Leo, how are you?
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   I am well getting ready for a big community day.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   Oh, yes, the biggest one ever.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   Uh-huh.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.440]   That's what Saturday starts Friday.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   And I finally got the little mel- mel-tan guy from the Pokémon Let's Go and transferred him over.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   And it looked like it would take weeks to evolve them, so I just spent all my rare candy Leo.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   I evolved them immediately.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   I have- I have no patience for that kind of stuff.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   Yeah, I have such poor implicit control.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   I never have more than one or two rare candies available anyway.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   Yes.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   Uh-huh.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.440]   Uh-huh.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   We're talking about Pokémon Go and I'm very, very sorry.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   I got the little ball.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   Florence, I am.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   Yeah, me too.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   You did?
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   So you put the mel-tan in the ball from the Let's Go ball?
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   There's a Mew that comes in the ball, I believe, but I just- I just got him involved.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.440]   You had to do a quest to get him Leo, and then I had no more patience.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   You're so next level Pokémon Go, I feel like such a punter next to you.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   I'm just happy to spin my ball and throw.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   Come on, you're sick of it by now.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   You just have to keep doing it so the coverage continues.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   I mean, it's still a juggernaut.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   Like, if you look at the raw numbers on how much interest this tough generates, it's ridiculous.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   It's like the perfect storm of childhood nostalgia with modern AR curiosity and geographic-based
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.440]   community gameplay, and it's just like there's hundreds of millions of people still going
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   at these events.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   It's not- I see people all the time.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   Somebody called me on the radio show, Mother, who does it with her daughter.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   She was all excited about Community Day.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   Uh-huh.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   That was the first weekend that came out.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   We met these people in the park and they said, "Oh, you know, my daughter wants to go play Pokémon
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   with me.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   She never wants to spend any time with me.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   I hope this game never ends."
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   Exactly.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   And how many billions of miles they've released the figure every once in a while, people have
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.040]   walked thanks to Pokémon Go, which you have to think is a huge improvement in overall health
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   of geeks everywhere.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.440]   And I actually know where the parks are in here.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   I mean, I never knew where the parks were here.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   I love getting gifts from you because they're from all these interesting spots in Quebec.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   Andy Inaco, who is too wise and venerable to play Pokémon Go, is also here.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.440]   On theCODECO.com, I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.440]   Great to see you from public radio in Boston.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   Yes, the mighty WGBH.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440]   I'm not too wise to do Pokémon.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   It's more like some people should own boats and go through all the trouble of owning a
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440]   boat.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.800]   Some people would much rather just have a friend who owns a boat and hear all the wonderful
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.000]   stories about boating and occasionally get to be on the boat for the cost of a 12-pack
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   of beer.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So that's...
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I'm enjoying the boating lifestyle through Pokémon.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.880]   through my friends like you.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.320]   - Like, seriously. (laughs)
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.940]   Like, like, vicarious Pokémon-ing.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.440]   - Also with us from DC I think.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.060]   No, it looks like you're up in British Columbia.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.900]   I decided if I can put anything back there,
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.740]   why not get- I'm starting to get in the festival spirit,
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.320]   you know, we've, we've finished Thanksgiving,
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.920]   I haven't put the lights on yet,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.080]   but, you know, you just got some trees back there.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.500]   Here what the heck?
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.740]   - Very pretty.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.500]   Pixelcor.com.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   - Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard arguments
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.620]   on a very odd ball case, if you ask me.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.980]   This is a lawsuit against Apple
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.260]   that accused it of breaking federal antitrust laws
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260]   by monopolizing the market for iPhone software,
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.620]   for iPhone apps, and as a result,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.180]   causing consumers to overpay.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.980]   The justices heard our, our arguments yesterday.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.620]   Apple appealed a lower court decision that would,
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.500]   now remember, this is just to allow
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.340]   the class action lawsuit to go forward.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.580]   This is not in the merits of the lawsuit,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.780]   but whether this class action lawsuit could even be filed.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.500]   It was filed in 2011 by a group of iPhone users
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.020]   seeking monetary damages.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.320]   Now you know how we feel about class action lawsuits.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.660]   Generally, they benefit only the lawyers who are filing them,
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.140]   and anybody who's been a beneficiary
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.100]   of a class action lawsuit knows that best,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.180]   you're gonna get an iTunes gift card for 59 cents.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.860]   But I think it's interesting that the lower court said
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.900]   that the suit could continue.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.380]   The Supreme Court, in fact, according to people
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.260]   who listened to the arguments,
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.260]   seemed like they were also inclined to let it continue.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.820]   The lawsuit said Apple violated federal antitrust laws
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.180]   by requiring apps to be sold through the app store,
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.700]   and then taking a 30% commission.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.900]   Thoughts, gentlemen?
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.340]   I mean, as developers reading this are just crying,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.740]   going 30% of what?
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.300]   30% of what?
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.940]   No one's paying for our apps.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.860]   Well, it's another case.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.580]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.420]   I was gonna say is that we're not talking about
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.180]   the merit of the case because there is no merit to this case.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.980]   The, we have never paid so little for so much
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.740]   as what we have now on our phones.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.900]   I mean, when you look at compared to what we used to buy,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.700]   and what we used to pay $50 for, $60 for,
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.900]   on our laptops and what we still sometimes pay on a desktop,
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.140]   what we pay now for what we're getting,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.300]   it may have hurt the developers
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.780]   that is not hurting the consumer.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.940]   We get an enormous amount of value for very little,
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.660]   and the apples take of that is not really what's affecting that.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.300]   I think it's more of the culture of what people
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.460]   are willing to pay.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.300]   And I think that also the issue is that
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.260]   the idea that they have a monopoly over it is like saying,
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.500]   Sears has monopoly over what you can sell at Sears.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.900]   I mean, the idea that Apple,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.860]   the advantage of Android existing is that Apple
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.860]   is a minority stakeholder.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.780]   I mean, in the market,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.420]   if you don't like this market,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.900]   there are the majority of people
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.340]   who are using another platform.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.260]   So I don't think there's any value in the actual lawsuit,
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.380]   but what is at stake is whether you can,
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.700]   and what the Supreme Court is really looking at is a,
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.380]   is who's the relationship with?
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.300]   That's all they're deciding.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.740]   Who's the consumer relationship with?
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.740]   Is it with the end seller or Apple?
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.620]   And I will say that,
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.900]   usually, and I will admit that I think that
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.860]   I generally think that the Ninth Circuit Court
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.340]   is kind of a Mickey Mouse Ralph Nader Court.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.180]   (laughs)
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.540]   Anything that like this that will go through,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.020]   the Ninth Circuit Court will approve.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.620]   But I do think the Supreme Court,
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.820]   even a conservative Supreme Court,
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.500]   may side with the plaintiffs on this,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.340]   not on the plaintiffs,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.860]   on the defendants, in this case,
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.100]   who will be the future plaintiffs.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.860]   Because I think that the relationship is a little murky,
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.580]   between, while you're buying from a vendor,
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.380]   most of us don't even know who that vendor is.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.380]   We buy the app on the phone.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.420]   We have almost no relationship with that.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.020]   With the vendor.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.580]   And so I think that it is going to be hard,
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.420]   an uphill battle for Apple to win this,
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.660]   from a liberal or a conservative court.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.100]   It's another instance of the law is historically funny,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.220]   because you think it's a simple issue,
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.620]   but then you look at the arguments
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.060]   and you realize that,
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.380]   yeah, this is why you have to go to law school
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.220]   for a number of years.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.940]   Not because reality is that complicated,
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.460]   but because legal arguments,
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.100]   if you really, really wanna win,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.460]   you have to pick and choose how you fight your battles.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.540]   And it can't be literally the way
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.020]   that the argument is being presented.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.900]   So, but the all the skepticism
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.020]   that the Supreme Court has been reported on
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.860]   about the hearings yesterday was about Apple's argument
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.180]   that the case should be thrown out on the basis
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.620]   that the consumer does not have a relationship with Apple.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.340]   The business relationship is between the consumer
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.940]   and the app developer.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.220]   And the precedent they're citing for this
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.220]   is the signature case regards the selling of brick.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.820]   That can a consumer sell the manufacturer of bricks
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.060]   because a brick layer made a bum wall for them.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.380]   And they're saying, well, no,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.220]   the consumer didn't buy the bricks from the brick manufacturer.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.580]   They bought the brick layer, bought the bricks
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.860]   and then sold a service containing bricks to the consumer.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.060]   And all of the, with only like one exception,
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.060]   according to the news reports,
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.380]   they all said, well,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.220]   I don't know if you're gonna have a lot of money
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   on the news reports, they all said,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.900]   I don't think that's the same thing at all.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.900]   The end, the argument that the suit is trying to make
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.420]   is that, and this is the other problematic thing
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.620]   on their side, is that they're saying that
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.100]   because there is absolutely no alternative
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.020]   but to go through the app store to buy apps
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.740]   because there's no other way to develop apps
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.580]   for the iPhone and the iPad,
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.740]   because there's no way to avoid that 30% tariff,
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.100]   so to speak, on every single app,
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.380]   the developers are forced to pass additional prices
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.380]   onto the consumer.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.780]   And I don't know how,
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.460]   I don't know if the case gets to that state,
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.140]   how much luck they're gonna have suggesting
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.660]   that all these apps that cost a dollar,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.020]   that cost nothing compared to,
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.980]   I think really all,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.740]   if it does go that far,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.180]   I think Apple just has to produce ads from,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.820]   any issue of Mac user or Mac world from the mid 90s
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.900]   and show them how much a tech senator cost back then
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.500]   and show them or any ad for Palm Trio apps back in the day,
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.700]   how much did a simple spreadsheet
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.220]   that did practically nothing cost would cost 50 bucks?
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.900]   - Why stick you know it's out cost 30 bucks, Andy?
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.860]   - Yeah, but I do think that it's an important thing
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.780]   to be argued that Android doesn't have this problem
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.460]   because there's a switch buried deep into settings
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.020]   that says this is a really dumb idea,
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.620]   but if you touch this switch,
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.940]   which we're telling you is a dumb idea,
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.260]   you'll be able to sideload apps from any source everywhere
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.420]   and that's dumb and dangerous
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.940]   and you really shouldn't do it,
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.020]   but okay, you're a functioning adult,
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.820]   we will let you do that.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.580]   And we also see the problems that were solved
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.180]   by Apple not making the App Store mandatory on Mac OS
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.980]   when a company like Bearbone Software said that,
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.260]   decided that we are being put through
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.260]   all kinds of terrible gymnastics forced to work
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.060]   on so much code for our app that does nothing,
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.660]   but serve the interests of Apple's App Store
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.980]   and taking away from our time making services
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.260]   and features that will benefit consumers,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.140]   we've decided that we would much rather spend
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.980]   all that time on making sure that our consumers are happy
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.860]   as opposed to Apple's App Store guidelines are happy
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.380]   and they're free to do that,
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.780]   whereas they're not free to serve their customers
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.660]   that way if they were doing iOS apps.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.180]   So I hope this question gets answered in one shape or form,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.540]   but realize that when you talk about at this stage,
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.580]   Apple being, quote, losing the battle,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.180]   they're basically just having one argument
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.660]   that they were making kind of kick to the curb
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.660]   and it just will rely on what gets allowed to go,
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.340]   to get argued next as opposed to ending
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.260]   or winning or losing it totally.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.220]   - Right, I mean, the issue is that in any legal battle,
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.980]   you never know how that end battle's gonna go.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.060]   So no matter how obvious this may seem to us
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.620]   that the silliness of this suit on many levels,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.860]   the issue is Apple's of course going to look for
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.300]   any good lawyer is going to look for all the little things,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.420]   all the motions that they can file
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.140]   before we even get to that court case,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.740]   because once you're in a court case,
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.660]   there's no guarantee.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.020]   And no matter how good you think your court case is,
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.540]   there's no guarantee you're gonna come out
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.140]   on the other side with the right judge
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.980]   or with the right jury that's going to give you
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.820]   your decision.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.620]   So what you wanna do is try to invalidate
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.580]   and these motions are very common.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.220]   The fact that it got all the way to the Supreme Court
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.060]   is kind of amazing.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.860]   It sounds like Apple did shoot it down at first
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.940]   and probably if it had been anywhere else in the country
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.060]   and didn't go through the Ninth Circuit,
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.620]   it probably would have not made it any further.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.820]   - This is not what they're deciding.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.780]   So let me just to be clear,
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.260]   what the Supreme Court is deciding is standing.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.220]   And this comes back to the issue of who has the right to sue.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.340]   And it goes back to this brick case,
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.820]   the Illinois brick company,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.620]   was being charged under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.420]   with monopoly because they price-fixed bricks
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.740]   and the Supreme Court in 1977
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.660]   ruled that only direct customers
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.380]   of the brick company had the right to sue.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.220]   The US government did not have the right to sue
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.940]   because they weren't buying the bricks directly.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.100]   And so what happened is Apple was sued
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.100]   and the issue that Apple fought over was,
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.060]   well, the class action has no merit
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.740]   because it's not from people
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.620]   who are directly affected by this.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.820]   It's by indirect purchasers and under Illinois brick,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.980]   they don't have standing to sue.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.860]   The ninth district ruled that they did.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.500]   That's what the Supreme Court has decided.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.180]   It's not gonna decide the issue.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.900]   The case will then, if the Supreme Court upheld
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.220]   the ninth circuit decision,
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.380]   it merely means that the class is valid
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.580]   that they do have standing to sue.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.300]   And it looks like the justices in the Supreme Court
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.300]   feel that way.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.900]   Neil Gorsuch did not apparently,
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.300]   but he wondered whether, actually, no, I'm sorry, he did,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.500]   he wondered whether the 1977 ruling was still valid
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.580]   in the modern marketplace.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.860]   Justice Roberts suggested he agreed with Apple.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.940]   Neil Kavanaugh apparently did not.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.660]   Eleanor Kagan, who is one of the, Eleanor Kagan,
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.180]   who is one of the so-called liberal justices,
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.300]   although I don't think we should really characterize him
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.620]   that way, said, "From my perspective,
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.060]   I've just engaged in a one-step transaction with Apple."
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.900]   Really, the issue is if 30% goes to, I think,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.260]   the issue is if 30% goes to Apple,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.740]   do the developers then pass that cost on to everybody else,
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.540]   to people who are buying apps?
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.020]   In other words, do you pay more for apps
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.740]   because of Apple's cut?
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.420]   And I think that's what the class action suit
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.580]   is essentially based on.
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.940]   But again, it's up to the Supreme Court
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.620]   to allow that suit to go forward.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.820]   At that point, many years in the distant future,
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.740]   this case will be decided by a lower court.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.620]   So they're just deciding whether
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.060]   the lawsuit could go forward
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.060]   based on completely based on the standing of the plaintiffs.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.740]   And as I said, what Apple's doing is they're gonna throw
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.620]   everything at this because this is affects
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.020]   their larger business model.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.140]   Regardless of how stupid the case is,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.500]   the standing has delayed that case by five years
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.020]   or six years.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.420]   So it was filed in 2011.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.460]   Just this one little bit has pushed it out
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.420]   five or six years as it were through there.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.340]   So that's been, and Apple will kick it down
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.860]   if they can delay it by another five or six years
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.340]   over another motion they will.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.620]   You know, and there's no reason.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.580]   - There's no other weird things.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.140]   For instance, all prices have to end in 99,
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.340]   like $4.99, you can't charge $5.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.220]   And the lowest price could be 99 cents.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.460]   That may be another bone of contention.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.300]   Well, why can't we have a 50 cent app?
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:01.020]   - I mean, as soon as it's all gonna be down the road,
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.220]   this Supreme Court case isn't even that.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.540]   It's just whether there's standing.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.060]   - Bro, and there's huge ramifications too,
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.540]   because there are places like, again,
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.540]   like Alex mentioned Walmart, Walmart,
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.460]   that you're buying from Walmart.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.460]   You're not buying from every single vendor in Walmart.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.780]   And Amazon, their marketplace has traditionally been,
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.780]   they won't even charge you like, they'll manage the store
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.620]   and they'll do all these things.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.700]   But they'll also tell you what price it's gonna be.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.700]   And they'll give it away for free if they feel like it.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.980]   And you can say thank you.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.980]   So it has, I think it's gonna have wide ranging
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.980]   ramifications way beyond Apple.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.900]   - I don't know if I understand that argument
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.060]   that you guys are making.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.060]   I mean, it's not that you have the ability to go by,
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.340]   imagine that your house is your iPhone,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.740]   that you don't have to buy all of your appliances
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.900]   from Sears, and because you can buy appliances
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.100]   from everywhere and install it inside your phone.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.660]   Whereas with the iPhone, that is the case
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.700]   where you can't buy, you're forced to shop
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.420]   at this one store for apps.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.420]   If a developer wants to sell someplace outside of Sears,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.060]   they're not allowed to do that.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.060]   So I don't think it's a silly concept
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.500]   of sewing on this basis.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.500]   I really hope that this is decided one way or another
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.060]   because it does come down to the right of ownership
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.140]   where I think if you've spent $800 on this phone,
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.980]   do you have the right to install whatever software
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.860]   you want from it from any source?
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.940]   Or are you essentially buying permission from Apple
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.780]   to buy more apps from them?
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.420]   - Isn't that how game consoles work though?
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.660]   I mean, Apple's always had a very game console like market,
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.700]   like you buy your Nintendo, you buy your Xbox,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.100]   and we can't even get them to do Fortnite cross compatible
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.180]   that huge argument.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.340]   - Yeah, it's similar to that.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.180]   - Yeah, it's similar.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.300]   - And I think that maybe there's some small percentage
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.780]   of Apple users that really care.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.860]   You know, I think that the bottom line is,
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.500]   is that most of us just want it to work
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   and it works better when it is a closed environment.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.740]   You know, I do think that fundamentally,
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.620]   our listeners can tell us whether I'm right or wrong,
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.060]   but I think fundamentally most people
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.140]   who are using an iPhone actually are less geeky
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.060]   about their phone than someone that is in an Android.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.420]   They don't, there's a very small percentage.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.980]   And I mean, less than a tenth of a percent probably,
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.980]   that really care whether they're in a closed system or not.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.100]   They just like the fact that everything installs correctly
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.940]   and works.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.260]   - No, they just don't care.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.900]   - I just, I don't, I really don't like that argument
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.820]   whenever it comes up.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.500]   It's a, if you, if this situation affects you,
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.380]   then that affects 100% of the market that you care about.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.980]   So it's, I think that sometimes some people are gonna think
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.180]   that it's a, there's a principle involved
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.260]   in that in principle, I want to have the ability,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.180]   when, once Apple decides to ditch support for my phone,
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.780]   if I still think that it's a fine phone
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.260]   and I want to continue to use it,
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.420]   even as a music player, it would be nice
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.500]   if I could simply flip a switch and simply say,
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.260]   here's, here's some really, really weirdos out there.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.900]   Weird men and women who are still developing apps
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.820]   for out of nostalgia or because they really like
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.220]   their iPhone 4 to, to create a suite of apps
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.580]   that really works well on this.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.580]   This is again, something that you can do on other platforms.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.580]   There, there's actually a whole third party kind of
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.180]   compatibility suite for other phones
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.220]   that once their manufacturer kind of drops support for them,
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.820]   you are able to then go in and say,
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.300]   okay, I guess this is, this has stopped being a Google phone
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.620]   and now this has started to be this open source
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.380]   repository sort of phone.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.420]   Again, that is, that is, I admit that,
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.580]   that is a small percentage of the user base out there,
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.900]   but if you are one of those people that either wants
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.020]   or even needs this to happen,
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.700]   that is 100% of the market that you care about.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.260]   - Well, I guess I would say if you're, that one,
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.900]   if you're that point, one, one, point zero, zero, one percent
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.420]   that think that that's important, you should buy an Android.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.020]   - I was like, you have another choice.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020]   - You can go buy something else.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.380]   - Maybe, again, maybe you spend $800 on a phone,
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.940]   that's, it still works great.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.700]   If the screen isn't correct, Apple isn't even making phones
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.140]   of that size anymore.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:09.020]   Touch all these buttons, click all these things off the list.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.580]   And again, it's, I own it, I paid money for this.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.060]   Here's my receipts for it.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.620]   And now I have to stick it in a drawer because of,
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.740]   not because of limitations of the hardware,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.380]   but because there is sort of a,
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.900]   there is a diplomatic policy that the regime known as Apple
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.020]   has decided to inflict upon the citizens of iOS, Bill.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.460]   And so it's not, I don't think it's inappropriate,
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.500]   regardless of the motivations of those people
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.620]   who are bringing the suit to force a court to decide,
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.740]   is this okay?
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.700]   Should a company be forced to say that at some point,
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.380]   we have to release our control of this device
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.380]   and let the people who buy this actually do
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.860]   what they want with it?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.140]   - I don't know if it's, it's not legally relevant,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.300]   but it might be kind of related.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.940]   Apple remember lost almost half a billion dollars
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.020]   lawsuit in the iBook store issue,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.300]   where they were accused of price fixing with publishers,
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.740]   the price of books in the iBook store.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.500]   And as a result, raising the price for all consumers.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.300]   And they lost that case and had to pay a fairly hefty
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.660]   - Yeah, the US is hugely, it's hugely low price sensitive.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.740]   Like most of the EU decisions are based on
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.900]   how competitive the market is.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.340]   Most of the US decisions are based on what can deliver
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.060]   the lowest price for the consumer.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.300]   So Apple got squashed Amazon got boosted and prices are low,
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.540]   but you have effectively no competition in that market now.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.060]   So it really is a geographic preference at this point.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.140]   And a lot of people will say that we need to just rat,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.860]   we totally redo how all these laws are interpreted
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.220]   because, and Ben Thompson's aggregation theory
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.420]   is a good example.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.500]   Things just don't work the way they used to.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.820]   - Yeah, Ben actually is a very good article in Stratecary
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.100]   today about this antitrust suit
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.940]   and talks about the standing, so forth.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.140]   So you can read that argument and why he thinks,
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.060]   and I think the Supreme Court will eventually rule
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.100]   that even indirect purchasers of app store apps
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.780]   do have standing to sue over this.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.940]   He also though says Apple's right in this case.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.460]   He says Apple has power over developers precisely,
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.020]   this is the aggregation theory you were talking about, Renee.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.020]   Precisely because it has all the consumers demand,
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.220]   in other words, it follows then as far more likely
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.300]   developers are pricing according to what the consumer
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.420]   market will bear in internalizing the app store fee
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.380]   as opposed to artificially pricing them hired
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.340]   to pass on that cost to consumers.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.180]   - And I would say that if you--
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.620]   - And I would say that if possible for them to demonstrate
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.340]   here's how high the prices are in the app store,
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.220]   again, 50 bucks for a simple note taking app
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.580]   in the late 90s, 100 bucks.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.620]   I was killing myself, looking at old catalogs the other day,
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.180]   like, oh my God, I could not afford to own a computer,
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.860]   I could afford to own a computer,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.780]   but I could never afford to own more than like two or three apps.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.300]   Thank God that I believed in piracy when I was 19 years old
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.940]   or else I never would have learned anything.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.300]   - I mean the idea--
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.900]   - I mean we also point out that--
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.540]   the Supreme Court assumed that Apple was an abusive monopoly
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.900]   that many of the questions took that as given.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.260]   - Yeah, as a given.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.220]   - And part of the reason that the prices went down
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.900]   was specifically because when the prices were high,
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.020]   everyone, everyone I knew, everyone, when we got started,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.300]   we all pirated a lot of software because that was the only way
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.260]   we could never afford Photoshop.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.060]   I mean I had to wait until I could afford a scanner.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.380]   So the thing is is that all of us pirated software
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.660]   and our teen teens at least,
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.980]   and that affected the price of everyone, for everyone.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.740]   A closed system that's highly secure,
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.220]   that makes sure that everyone's paying for it,
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.540]   means that the price also can be lower.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.980]   And so for everybody.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.260]   And so there's a tax to an open system
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.700]   that is that you have to charge as a software manufacturer
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.740]   because you're only selling to 20% of the people
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   that have your app.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.660]   - Well you can make the, I mean it's clear
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.460]   that prices are cheaper for apps than they were for,
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.700]   and still are for desktop software.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.540]   You can make that argument,
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.620]   but I'm not sure if that's the piracy tax Alex
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.980]   or if it's because Apple has put pressure on developers
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.380]   to charge less for their apps.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.100]   - I would argue it's commodity,
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.100]   there's just, before apps were so rare
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.820]   that there was real demand for them.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.260]   And now there's their commodities,
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.340]   they're everywhere, there's 19 different Twitter apps,
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.100]   there's 300 different calendar apps.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.700]   And you simply, even Photoshop, Photoshop was a monolith.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.580]   And now there's so many different alternatives
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.660]   that you went from a market of rarity
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.100]   to a market of ubiquity.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.300]   And it's impossible to maintain pricing
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.500]   when software is, again,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.740]   and this has happened to everywhere.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.820]   Like we saw media,
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.460]   media has to go and buy your newspaper,
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.540]   buy your magazine,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.380]   and now there's so much available online.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.860]   And it just goes industry by industry
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.020]   as it becomes digital,
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.140]   the surplus far exceeds the demand
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.140]   and the whole pricing structure inverts.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.900]   - Yeah, it's a big question about how the plaintiffs
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.220]   will be able to successfully pursue this case.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.460]   But one of the arguments that fails for me personally
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.860]   is when the arguments made
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.820]   that we've made such a great decision for you.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.580]   And let me show you the flip charts
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.500]   on how badly off you would be
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.980]   if you didn't have this monopoly
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.740]   or you didn't have this system in place.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.140]   Again, sometimes it's a case of,
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.980]   sometimes it's a case where somebody thinks
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.300]   it's a point to be made.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.700]   That again, I own the $600 phone.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.700]   I want to be able to do what I want with it.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.540]   So.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.580]   - Yeah, you and I mean,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.940]   the arguments between you and Alex are really about,
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.500]   Alex is very pragmatic.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.820]   Look, people just want it easy and simple.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.980]   And you're making a larger, I think,
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.820]   more philosophical point.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.820]   - And principal, right.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.860]   I mean, a point of principle.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.340]   The interesting thing here,
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.100]   and according to Ben Thompson,
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.980]   even if the Supreme Court rules
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.740]   the plaintiffs don't have standing and says,
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.380]   "You know, you can't pursue this."
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.180]   It isn't the end of it by any means.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.620]   First of all, I points out,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.420]   most states, including California,
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.220]   don't follow the Illinois brick precedent.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.180]   So there's a, he says, there's a decent chance.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.780]   The question of whether or not the App Store
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.940]   and Apple's associated policies are an antitrust violation
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.140]   will probably make its way to court sooner or later
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.620]   in some other form or fashion.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.940]   Apple is not out of the antitrust hot water.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.780]   - Yeah.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.140]   Well, and I think, I still think that the number one thing
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.180]   that protects Apple to some degree is Android.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.100]   You know, is that Apple is such a small percentage
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.140]   of the overall market that it's,
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.020]   I think that that is a steep hill to climb for most
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.500]   antitrust conversations because you do have
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.700]   a much larger choice.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.060]   - Yeah, but if you're Amazon and Ben brings this up
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.260]   and you can't put the Amazon store in the Amazon app,
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.460]   that means a whole 50% of the market in the United States
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.300]   is not gonna be able to buy books and Kindle books
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.500]   from the Kindle app or Audible Books from the Audible app
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.580]   on iOS.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.980]   - And Amazon wasn't selling Apple products for a long time.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.780]   So the biggest retailer you can buy Apple products for.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.420]   - Yeah, that could be problematic if some were to sue
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.300]   that the iBooks app can sell books to consumers
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.460]   without a 30% internal markup.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.260]   However, the Kindle app and the Comixology app
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.060]   has to kick back 30% to somebody else.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.900]   But again,
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.740]   - No room for double-
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.580]   - Except have people in it.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.420]   - Exactly.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.940]   - You have the creator and you have the purchaser
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.620]   and there's room for one person to have the agency fee
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.500]   of like 30% or 15%.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.780]   But you start to put two or three agencies in there.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.580]   You wanna have Amazon and Apple in the middle
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.420]   and there's just not enough money to go around.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.980]   Not unless you start screwing creators again,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.420]   like we did for many, many years.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   - Ben says this is an example of rent seeking Apple.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.300]   Does nothing to increase the value for instance
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.220]   of Netflix shows or Spotify, music or Amazon books
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.780]   or any number of digital services
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.060]   from any number of app providers,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.740]   they simply skim off 30% because they can.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.580]   That's, you couldn't argue that, right?
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.420]   Is anybody-
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   - Or 15 now for,
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.580]   almost 15 now for Netflix.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.540]   - 15, 30, yeah.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.860]   It's an actual city.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.700]   - But the point is they're not adding any value except
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.540]   by-
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.380]   - Not the value.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.380]   - Well, by other than building the best market
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.260]   for selling an app in the world.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.100]   I mean, like it's-
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.420]   - No, I'm not talking the app store.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.740]   I'm talking about Spotify too.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.980]   I'm talking about Amazon books.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.140]   I'm talking about Netflix.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.220]   Not merely the app store, any purchase.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.820]   In app purchases.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.660]   - Yeah.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.500]   - Yeah.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.340]   - Any purchase.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.540]   - And you can also make the argument that,
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.460]   okay, fine developers, you want to be able to make
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.740]   and sell apps to directly to consumers
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.340]   without our interference.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.180]   Great.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.660]   You don't get to use Xcode anymore
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.740]   and you don't get to use our wonderful APIs anymore.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.260]   - You can say that, that's true.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.620]   - I'm saying that it did play devil's advocate.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.100]   They put a lot of,
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.340]   Apple could make the, I think the argument that
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.380]   they're making, it's not 30% off of sales
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.300]   of everything that they do,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.620]   that they are funding the development cost
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.940]   of this wonderful development platform
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.700]   and all of the tools to make it work
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.100]   and all the APIs to make all these software easy, easy to make.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.300]   And that's basically what-
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.100]   - Is that worth the $3 a month per concept
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.020]   'cause with Skyward and Netflix though?
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.020]   - That's a lot of money.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.860]   (laughing)
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.020]   - I think that's a choice.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.260]   - That's a Netflix estimate.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.500]   - Well, look at Fortnite,
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.340]   which decided it didn't wanna pay Google's 30%
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.780]   and be on the Play Store.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.780]   - But I mean, it also subsidizes all the free apps.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.260]   Like they, both these platforms make all these apps available
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.340]   and they handle a transaction
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.260]   and the virus checking and the storage
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.380]   and everything for those apps absolutely for free
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.380]   and that money comes from the pool of money at collect.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.180]   They certainly make tons of profit too,
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.140]   but that comes from the pool of monies that they collect
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.980]   and they do front, like storefront marketing,
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.260]   the app store and the Google Play Store
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.220]   are still some of the best places for discovery
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.100]   and you get prime real estate in that
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.980]   when you're inside.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.740]   You just have to decide.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.540]   I remember Craig Hawkenberry wrote a post
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.260]   when they first announced the app store
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.140]   saying you have no idea how much we used to pay
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.020]   for processing and web hosting
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.020]   and people would download our apps
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.860]   and do anything that's wrong.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.260]   - Ingram, micro used to take half, right?
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.540]   When you went to a software distributor.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.860]   - Door's take 55%.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.420]   - Yeah.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.980]   I mean, just to process your credit card
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   and provide a charge for a long time was 22, 25%.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.220]   You know, and that was just due to the gateway.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.060]   - That's not anymore.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.500]   - We should point out it's not anymore.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.820]   - It's not anymore, no, it's two and a half percent.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.220]   - So maybe these are for a long.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.060]   - Yeah.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.780]   I know when I write a book, for instance,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.260]   which I don't do anymore because it's not profitable.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.820]   That you get a percentage, usually five to 15%
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.220]   of half the cover price because the publisher's
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.580]   only getting half the cover price.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.340]   The bookstore is getting the other half.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.540]   So this is, believe me, this is nothing new.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.300]   This is how retail works in the United States.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.420]   And if anything, it's flatter than it used to be
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.980]   because if you sell software,
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.980]   you don't have to go through Ingram Micro.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.620]   You don't have to print a box and put it on disks
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.620]   and all the other costs associated with it.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.980]   Apple does the downloads.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.700]   I think most developers probably are happy
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.460]   to give them the 30%, but that's not neither here nor there.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.300]   - I do hear any event.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.460]   This is not a conversation that's going away
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.260]   because this is just the Supreme Court deciding
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.220]   whether this lawsuit can go forward.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.460]   If they say, yes, we'll be talking about this
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.180]   five years from now in the lawsuit.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.100]   Finally comes to a head.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.660]   - This is something that Tim Cook's successor
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.460]   is going to have to deal with as well.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.300]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.260]   - In the olden times, they used to design cathedrals.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.260]   And the person who comes up with the plans
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.140]   for the cathedral would die knowing that,
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.940]   it would make them knowing that my job is to hand it off
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.620]   to the next generation of people because this will never
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.140]   be finished within my lifetime.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.300]   And lawsuits are the same thing where they know
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.180]   that at some point I will be either arrested
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.220]   or shot to death by somebody who was annoyed
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.100]   by what I did or even just by old age.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.900]   And I have to groom the next generation of lawyers
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.100]   who's going to figure out what to do with this suit.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.380]   - My analogy is something a little closer to home.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.900]   When you buy a bottle of Louis XIII's cognac,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:09.460]   100 year old cognac, the winemakers
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.940]   who started that cognac are long gone.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.780]   - Many generations.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.100]   - Generations.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.940]   - Why is that cognac so pointy?
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.260]   I thought that this was supposed to be,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.100]   where we were supposed to be smooth.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.700]   - And Leo, are we going to have that for Christmas?
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.540]   Come on, Leo.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.860]   - Oh, we really should for our holiday show.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.300]   Get a bottle of how much is it?
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.780]   It's expensive, isn't it?
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.580]   - I think it's like 3500 bucks.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.540]   (laughing)
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.660]   - Hey, if Ferel can do it, I can do it.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.780]   It's a beautiful bottle too.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.380]   - It's the iMac Pro of Brown Liquor.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.020]   - Let's put it this way, Alex.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.700]   If you come in for our, a Twit holiday show
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.620]   on December 23rd, I will have a bottle if I can get one,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.540]   but in that time of Louis XIII's waiting for you.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.380]   - I'll be there.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.060]   (laughing)
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.420]   - All right, now I have to find out where I can buy it.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.220]   - I've been at the restaurants and I've tried to get it
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.340]   where you know, you could, it's like--
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.420]   - You can actually get it.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.380]   - You can actually get it at Willoughby's.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.780]   - Oh, really?
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.100]   - Willoughby's in Petaluma has it?
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.260]   They have a lot.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.460]   That's actually better than Bevmo.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.780]   - Willoughby's in Petaluma has Louis XIII.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.180]   - They did, they did about a year ago.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.140]   - I just want the bottle.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.420]   I just looked at it at the bottle.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.460]   - I'll give you the cognac.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.380]   - You can keep the cognac.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.420]   I want the bottle.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.500]   All right, Alex.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.740]   So make a note of that, Carson.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.820]   This is how we're gonna get people to come in on December 23rd.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.940]   (laughing)
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.460]   We're gonna offer them Louis XIII.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.620]   Just a finger full.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.980]   No, you can have a, I'll give you--
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.300]   - I'm gonna giant finger.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.140]   (laughing)
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.300]   - A pretty giant finger.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.380]   Let's take a break, 'cause I have some brandy to pay for.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.980]   (laughing)
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.140]   What have I done?
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.220]   What have I done?
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.300]   Our show today brought to you by Slidebelts.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.780]   This is a little bit more reasonable of a gift
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.740]   for the belt wearer in your family.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.460]   Now I stopped wearing belts,
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.420]   as I think a lot of people of a certain girth have,
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.780]   because belts are a medieval solution
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.180]   to holding your pants up.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.260]   The belt, a piece of, I mean,
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.620]   this may go back to cavemen,
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.620]   a strap of leather with four or five holes in it,
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.940]   and you better fit one of those holes.
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.660]   The problem is it's always either too tight or too loose,
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.660]   right?
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.220]   It's very rarely fits perfectly,
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.900]   which means either your pants fall down,
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.380]   or you can't breathe.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.980]   Slidebelts is a 21st century solution to that problem.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.380]   This is a slide belt.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.220]   See that?
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.420]   Those are ratchets.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:34.420]   32 independent ratchets, which means 32 sizes to fit you.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.380]   So here's what happens.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.380]   When you buy the slide belt,
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.540]   you get the buckle separate,
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.500]   and they have a variety of beautiful buckles.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.300]   This one is the antique brass.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.500]   I have one that I have engraved.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.580]   I love this.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.540]   I actually have two of these.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.380]   One is on my belt,
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.220]   but this is a buckle just so you can see it.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.140]   This one says, "Twit,"
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.780]   but this would be a great gift.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.820]   Put dad's initials on it.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.860]   If you have a wedding coming up,
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.140]   Grimsman's gift,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.540]   and then you get the strap separate,
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.220]   and they have a huge variety of straps,
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.260]   everything from casual canvas
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.860]   to the beautiful, high quality,
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.700]   full grain and top grain leather straps.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.860]   When you get the strap,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.340]   it's separate from the buckle.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.140]   The first thing you're gonna do is cut it roughly to size.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.380]   So they actually have measurements
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.380]   and one end of the strap.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.860]   So you could say, "Well, you know,
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.420]   "usually I'm about 38 inches, or I'm 40 inches."
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.940]   So you cut it there,
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.500]   and then you insert it into the buckle.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.220]   These buckles are swappable.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.180]   So you can have multiple straps and multiple buckles
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.340]   and mix and match to make yourself happy.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.780]   I'm gonna put this in here.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.420]   It's very easy to do.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.020]   Just goes right in this little slot and locks down,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.460]   and it's boy, when they lock down,
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.500]   they will not come out.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.300]   That is, now this is a belt.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.460]   It's attached.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.940]   Now, put it on.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.380]   You've got it close to the right size,
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.860]   but when you put it on,
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.220]   you're gonna use the ratchets to get it just perfect.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.620]   And listen, this is the sound Lisa hears every morning.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.860]   As I sitch up my belt.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.340]   But here's the sound you hear
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.340]   when you have a little too much turkey
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.300]   at the holiday festivities of loosening the belt.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.700]   No one will know.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.220]   Get it just the right ratchet,
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.740]   and that way you're comfortable,
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.700]   but your pants don't fall down.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.700]   It's about time they invented a belt
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.060]   that actually works slide belts by Brig Taylor,
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.340]   and they're beautiful.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.100]   It's a great gift 'cause they got every kind of style
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.140]   and fashion colorful belts for kids,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.700]   skinny belts for women.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.500]   And if you have a Ron Swanson in your family,
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.060]   and Nick Offerman type,
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.180]   somebody, an outdoorsman, a woodsman,
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.300]   or woods lady, somebody who really loves
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.420]   to be in the great outdoors,
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.660]   you will like, I love this,
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.340]   the slide belt survival belt.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.140]   This is a buckle like no other.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.300]   It has inside, let me show it, show it.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.220]   I can open it up, there's a knife.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.660]   By the way, it's very sharp and a bottle opener.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.980]   It all, in the belt buckle,
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.060]   don't try to get through the TSA with this.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.020]   And it's got a flashlight, a very bright LED flashlight,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.460]   you could take out of the buckle
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.060]   so you're not lost in the woods.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.020]   And if you have a boy scouting you will like this,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.340]   you could start a fire with a fire starter
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.180]   on the other end of the flashlight.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.620]   It's a four in one, make it five in one
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.980]   'cause it's also holding up your pants belt buckle,
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.780]   the survival belt, and I tell you what,
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.300]   this is a great gift for somebody.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.900]   They're gonna laugh, they're gonna howl,
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.340]   they're gonna say, oh what a funny idea,
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.860]   and then they're gonna use it.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.180]   They're gonna love this.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.580]   Slide belts, they offer watches now
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.420]   with swappable watch bands for the ultimate customization.

[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.340]   This is gonna, this is my survival belt.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.580]   Don't mess with me.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:25.780]   Moving on, Apple stores, they're doing some events,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.900]   they're kicking off the free hour of code sessions
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.620]   next week and new Swift coding club materials
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.300]   are now available.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.300]   I really, for me, coding is the most fun.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.500]   I love to do it.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.700]   I had to do this in the battle days
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.900]   when you were on your own using Apple Soft Basic.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.980]   We've come a long way and I think there's a lot of kids.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.060]   It's interesting that Apple shows, actually it's nine to five Mac,
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.820]   but I suspect this comes from Apple's own branding,
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.220]   some kids with iPads and Spheroes,
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.980]   which is a kind of coding you can do, absolutely.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.420]   Computer Science Education Week,
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.940]   starting today's students can register
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.180]   for thousands of free hour of code sessions
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.580]   they'll be available in store at all Apple store locations
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.660]   starting December 1st, running through December 14th.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.740]   I think this is really awesome.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.180]   I've gone every year, they're terrific.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.620]   Oh, do you go? Oh, fun.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.460]   - I take my God kids.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.300]   I take my God kids.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.300]   And every year there's something different.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.780]   Like they did make your own video games
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.140]   and they did Swift Playgrounds.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.660]   Last year they did the Sphero.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.620]   It wasn't BB8, it was the Evil BB8.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.860]   But they got to learn how to make it roll.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.060]   And it's just, and they have a really high ratio
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.820]   of Apple store employees to the kids
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.620]   and really good programs and they often play,
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.940]   you know, really famous CEOs or coders,
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.700]   you know, it's inspirational videos.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.500]   It's just really well produced.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.460]   - This is the Swift coding club.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.700]   This is something new now.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.580]   The Swift app on iOS, what do they call it?
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.900]   The Swift Playgrounds are really great.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.620]   This is a little different.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.740]   This is, I guess for a learner who maybe wants a book
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.660]   kind of thing.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.140]   And, you know, of course you'd still be using Swift
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.420]   on a computer, but there's the T,
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.820]   it integrates with the Tinker app,
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.080]   which I'm a big fan of, TYN, K-E-R.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.940]   Problem solving with algorithms,
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.220]   make my sandwich using the keynote template provided.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.460]   So this uses keynote, make a sandwich
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.140]   by dragging your choice of fillings
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.260]   onto the sandwich template.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.860]   So it's teaching kids kind of the fundamentals
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.300]   of algorithms, debugging.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.260]   They're using the tunnel bug video game for debugging.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.340]   I really think this is, this is,
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.700]   and I think the intent of this, I would guess,
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.300]   is for a teacher or a parent to download this
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.660]   and to set it up and to work with the kids on this.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.340]   And you're gonna learn, you know,
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.700]   the fundamental computer science concepts
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.260]   and in a fun, practical and engaging way,
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.780]   I think this is really great.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.340]   - And I was talking to Guillermo Rambla other day
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.700]   and he said that he's even just put the blank playground
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.500]   in there and quickly wrote a couple classes
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.100]   and then exported them and used them in his app.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.380]   So I mean, like, you can really scale this thing,
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.380]   but you can scale this thing.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.220]   And it gives you a lot of the fundamental skills
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.940]   and they're providing it for free.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.140]   All you have to do is sign up and I encourage you to do that
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.180]   because the slots, there are limited slots.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.860]   So take one when you can.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.700]   - Thus teaching the most important programming lesson
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.060]   of all, finding the code you need elsewhere
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.420]   and cutting and pasting it to your own project.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.860]   (laughing)
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.940]   - Absolutely.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.380]   - And I, back when I was doing it,
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.580]   when I started it was the magazines of code
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.620]   and you would literally sit there and type in to puke.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.460]   - You remember that?
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.500]   - Yeah, yep, yep.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.780]   - Nightmare.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.500]   - Well, someone was telling us in Eastern Europe
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.620]   that they could, I think it was a Commodore 64,
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.500]   but they, radio stations would actually play the code
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.900]   from the tapes over the air and you record it
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.020]   and then put it into your computer to play.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.580]   - So somewhere in the Not Go archives,
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.020]   I have a couple of old computing magazines from the mid 70s
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.060]   that actually has a vinyl flexi disc,
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.020]   like actually bound into it.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.660]   So you pull it out and it actually put it on a turntable
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.620]   and then connect it to the cassette port and has,
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.620]   the idea of having a vinyl record of the software,
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.220]   that really makes me feel old that I was alive
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.340]   when this was a thing.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.340]   - That's so great.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.140]   Now, I don't wanna sound negative,
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.020]   so I don't mean this to be negative.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.860]   - But it's so much fun to be negative.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.780]   - It's just a question.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.420]   Well, see, I learned as all I you did,
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.180]   anybody at a certain age did pretty much self-taught, right?
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.660]   And then at some, you know,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.860]   typing in programs from magazines and then fixing them
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.980]   and then hacking code, you learn,
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.140]   it's not a good way to learn a code by any means,
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.980]   spaghetti code and you're hacking it together.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.620]   And then at some point, many of us got something
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.100]   a little more formal, but usually that was later,
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.140]   that was in, you know, college level classes.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.980]   - Comp-sigh.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.820]   - Comp-sigh.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.660]   And that's a very different way of learning.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.860]   So I have no experience,
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.900]   if I don't even know any kids who have learned in this way,
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.300]   learning through apps and the modular things,
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.220]   we talked, I think maybe about this Alex,
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.740]   a couple of weeks ago,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.940]   or I'm looking at the way they're teaching this in,
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.420]   in this booklet from Apple.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.700]   - Does this work?
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.820]   - I don't know, I mean, I'm just starting to do it
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.820]   with my kids and so my kids have been doing this
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.140]   with playgrounds and they are definitely playing with it.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.940]   And a lot of what we have to talk about more than anything
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.020]   else is what do they wanna do with it?
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.500]   You know, what do you wanna do with it?
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.340]   There has to be a problem.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.180]   I think that the hard part of learning anything like this
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.340]   or pretty much any skill is you have to have a project
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.300]   to work on.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.420]   And so having that project to work on
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.260]   and then going back to find out how to do it
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.380]   is really always gonna be one of the most effective ways
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.540]   to learn it.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.940]   And then of course what you need is some expert help
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.860]   to make that work.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.060]   And I think that, you know,
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.260]   I think that the problem really is
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.380]   they have to make it really interesting.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.060]   I think that when I look at this,
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.300]   you know, I've said this before,
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.260]   but the problem with school is that
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.500]   it's all run by people who were good at it.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.220]   And so I think the challenge right now is there's a lot of,
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.100]   a lot of stuff here that is done by folks
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.500]   that are really good at, you know,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.980]   they understand a lot about pedagogy
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.540]   and all the things that are there.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.260]   I think that, and so I think that it,
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.460]   and I think it definitely has the right core
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.460]   of the coding ideas and process.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.700]   I think that we need to find ways to get to the kids
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.380]   that maybe aren't as engaged.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.500]   That might be just excited about trying to fix,
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.420]   you know, trying to do something.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.260]   And so I think that I find my kids are really engaged with,
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.540]   there's a maker after school thing that is in Nevada.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:42.020]   And my kids go, my son goes four times a week after school.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.180]   And I think he gets more out of that
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.340]   than he gets out of school.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.020]   And my daughter goes twice a week.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.620]   And there's like, in fact, on Thursdays,
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.660]   it's like girls only.
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.820]   So, so the-
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.660]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.220]   I really think that's important.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.660]   We talked about that on iOS today.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.300]   And there's a new, Apple has a new program
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.740]   for promoting, develop a women run on startups.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.500]   - Oh yeah, the entrepreneurs program.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.340]   - Yeah.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.260]   - And at first, you know, I think some people's reaction is,
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.020]   well, why are they giving girls special,
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.100]   you know, treatment, what about boys?
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.380]   But honestly, you know, I'm sure your daughter
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.460]   Isabella faces this, I know my daughter did.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.220]   If you're in an environment where it's mostly guys,
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.420]   and you're, and one or two girls,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.180]   the girls tend to get steamrolled.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.020]   - You're a quieter.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:23.860]   - Yeah.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.300]   - And don't get to participate.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.620]   And I think it's why so many women don't like math
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.180]   is because, you know, they kind of got steamrolled in school
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.220]   and never got a chance to really enjoy it.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:36.260]   And there's no reason, you know, no intellectual reason
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.980]   why women can't run companies.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.460]   I know that 'cause my companies run by a woman.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.620]   Can't write code, can't be technical.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.020]   And I think the best way to promote diversity
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.660]   is doing what Apple's doing,
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.740]   which is kind of like affirmative action
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.580]   is providing special programs.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.220]   - There was a program.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.740]   Scott Forstahl started a long time ago at Apple
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.020]   with Don Melton, a bunch of other people,
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.020]   where they realized that in order to have
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.260]   to increase the amount of women in the teams
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.180]   that they wanted to do, they had to include women
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.580]   in the entire range of process from going to the schools
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.980]   because sometimes women wouldn't approach men at booths.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.100]   They wanted to have women in the booths.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.900]   They wanted to have women reviewing the applications.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.260]   They wanted to have women doing interviews.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.700]   - We can go a trade show, at least until recently,
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:18.300]   and they're staffed by booths, babes, and skimpy outfits.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.940]   That's gotta be off-putting to women.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.100]   That's not an environment that promotes.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.940]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.740]   And so this, when you look at what Apple's doing,
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.940]   it's not just for the women, but it's run by a lot of,
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.340]   Apple has incredible women.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.300]   Cheryl, who runs all the developers,
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.340]   stuff including Swift Playgrounds and Adele,
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.140]   who runs the messages, you know,
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.740]   and Vicki who runs JavaScript for Matt.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.660]   There's just so many amazing women engineers there,
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.820]   and it looks like they're the ones
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.300]   who are actively involved in all this,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.380]   and that's the best indication
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.140]   that this is being taken seriously.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.300]   - This is for, it's called Apple Entrepreneur Camp,
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.020]   and it's four organizations founded and led by women.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.980]   We believe apps for everyone should be made by everyone.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.900]   And there actually is a strong case to be made
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.500]   that apps which are developed in a unique,
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.020]   a monoculture of male engineer types
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.100]   are not going to be as good as apps that are made
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.020]   by people with different experiences,
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.700]   different life choices, different genders.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.540]   That's good for everybody.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.540]   - The amount of mistakes they prefer.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.460]   - And by the way, as we get into artificial intelligence,
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.460]   it's gonna be more and more important,
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.220]   and we've already seen that AI,
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.060]   machine learning does not have these inherent biases.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.500]   That's gonna make it terrible.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.460]   - I think that also that a lot of us build apps,
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.500]   the first apps that I build,
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.100]   and even the things that I still build,
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.620]   whether it's with my own code or not,
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.700]   but all the things that I'm doing,
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.500]   I'm fixing problems that are in my life.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.540]   So I have an itch to scratch over,
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.820]   something isn't working quite as well
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.460]   as I can't find another solution for it.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.100]   So I either write it myself,
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.740]   or I have somebody else write it for me,
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.460]   and I'm constantly solving these.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.260]   These are my problems, and these are as a male,
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.500]   that's in technology.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.540]   These are the problems that I have.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.500]   Women programming, women solving those problems,
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.020]   they're gonna solve one entirely new set of problems
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.500]   that are their problems.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.980]   They're looking at every day,
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.820]   there's something that is a problem for them,
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.300]   and they'll build an app for that.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.140]   Or they're gonna build some kind of technology for that,
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.580]   but it's going to be women-centric,
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.980]   and that still happens.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.900]   - CR1. - Hack market says in the chatroom,
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.780]   "The vast majority of fart apps are written by men."
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.140]   - I think that's safe to say.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.420]   (laughing)
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.500]   I would agree with that.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.340]   - What do you know?
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.180]   - You know. - You know.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.020]   - You're working.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.580]   Although, I don't know if I put it past my daughter.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.900]   She's got a pretty rough sense of humor.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.660]   - Do you want me to get back to this notion?
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.300]   I mean, there's two reasons, more than two, probably,
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.500]   but there's at least two reasons why children
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.060]   should learn coding.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.100]   It's same reason I think kids should take math,
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.860]   and when I was in high school,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.940]   I was, "Ah, what am I never gonna do algebra one
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.980]   in real life?"
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.740]   It's not about learning the skills of coding necessarily,
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.820]   or the skills of algebra one.
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.700]   It's learning a way to think that is very useful
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.580]   later in business, to think logically,
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:00.580]   to be able to put together a logical string of ideas,
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:06.820]   to innovate, I mean, there's a lot to be learned in coding,
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.380]   even if you will never again code.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.580]   And look at this, this is from the Swift codebook.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.380]   This is great thinking bits.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.060]   Composition and decomposition,
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:20.300]   this is a programmer concept where you take a larger task
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.580]   and you break it down into smaller tasks.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.540]   And the way they're showing it is with the cup song video.
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.340]   So it's working small groups to learn the routine
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.980]   by breaking it into smaller parts,
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.780]   download the movie, into notes or pages,
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.740]   as you watch the movie divide into smaller parts,
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.580]   label each section.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.620]   This is a great way to teach decomposition.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.260]   This is useful as a programmer,
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.620]   you need to know this is absolutely part
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.340]   of a computer science curriculum,
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.940]   but it's also useful in general, in life,
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.340]   and I think this is a very engaging way to teach it.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.260]   So this is a lot more than just about using Swift to write
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.100]   an app.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.220]   - The ongoing question is that the problem is that,
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.100]   of course, any language or any code system
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.820]   that they learned today is gonna be probably
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.180]   opposite leaders or past,
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.700]   by the time they actually need to apply it practically.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.900]   And so how do we teach basic thinking that will help?
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.900]   And I also like the idea of putting a new emphasis
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.460]   on art classes, on music classes,
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.660]   on things that allow kids to develop their ability
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.420]   to think in an abstract way.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.860]   And also, I'm glad you mentioned,
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.540]   and I'm glad that you called out that feature
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.740]   of the curriculum that Dapple put together,
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.060]   because I've always thought that if you wanted to teach
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.980]   people how to program, I would put them
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.060]   in a one year carpentry course,
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   because it is about, and have them make a desk.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.700]   And because it seems like a big, horrible thing
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.900]   for like a 10 or 12 year old or a 14 year old to make,
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.300]   but then you break it down into smaller pieces
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.900]   and you realize that at the basic level,
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.780]   all I have to do is measure this piece of wood
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.260]   and cut it to a certain length
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.220]   and make sure that it's cut at a right angle.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.460]   And then the more complex idea is you're working in a team
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.780]   is to say, guess what, you're making drawers,
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.540]   and I'm gonna be making the part of the desk
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.020]   that the drawer is going to fit into.
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.460]   We need to get together on how your part
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.220]   is going to fit into my part.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.100]   So when you get kids that young where their brains
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.380]   literally are still, the hardware is still developing,
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.380]   the software is still being developed
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.900]   for that wet computer inside their heads.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.820]   I think that it's really, really great to put a focus on
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.700]   what skills do we want to teach them
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.220]   that they can apply everywhere.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.140]   And I think it should include teamwork,
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.020]   it should include the idea that I'm not making a desk.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.380]   I'm cutting this one piece of wood,
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.540]   which is important to make the entire desk.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.900]   I've got a clear goal in mind,
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.980]   which is to make a desk.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.100]   We have a way to test to see if that is a desk
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.700]   or just a pile of wood that is really ripe for kindling.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.100]   All this sort of stuff that will help them get along
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.940]   in any industry that they get in with.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:01.460]   I would love if all public schools were funded well enough
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.500]   to teach classes and everything,
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.460]   but as I grow older and as I look at the skills
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:10.540]   that really were the most valuable to me as a kid,
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.660]   I'm starting to think that if we could,
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:17.660]   if we can fund a coding program or a well thought out
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.660]   carpentry workshop program or a well thought out art program
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.740]   or a well thought out music program,
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:28.580]   I'm thinking that these arts and crafts segments
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.620]   are gonna help out these kids a lot more
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.940]   than learning specifically how to write a JavaScript
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.140]   or PHP or even Swift.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.340]   - Swift coding club, highly recommended.
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.220]   I'm very impressed having read through this
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.540]   and there would be a great thing for maybe an afterschool
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.140]   club to start in a, this is kind of perfect
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.700]   for middle school, I would say.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.460]   Maybe we'll do this at home with Michael and his friends.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.460]   He's 16.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:53.700]   He wants to learn how to code.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.900]   And I agree with you 100% Andy,
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.700]   that these skills are transferable
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.300]   and they don't actually only come from computer science.
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.220]   They might come from carpentry.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.900]   - I think the most important thing that I've learned
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.580]   that I probably use from coding more than any code
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.580]   that I ever wrote was when something's going wrong,
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.980]   reduce all the variables and slowly add the variables back
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.660]   until you figure out which one's broken.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:16.540]   I mean, that is something that I use in all parts of life.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.860]   - Yeah, it's a goal.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.100]   - And I think that that's super important.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.580]   - 100%.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.660]   My life got so much better and I was responsible
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:29.700]   for so many fewer catastrophic failures in my life.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.940]   When I embraced the, when I learned and embraced
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.180]   the concept of take one step back, what is the goal here?
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.060]   What are we trying to accomplish?
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:41.180]   Because the goal here is not to cut this piece of wood
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:45.820]   with the saw, the goal is to make this big thing.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.660]   The thing that's frustrating me right now
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.300]   is it important we do it as is
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.100]   or can we achieve the goal someplace else?
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.580]   And it also helps me with things like,
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:00.580]   okay, does going to the store buying a weak old fish
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.180]   coming back into this office
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.740]   and beating someone over the head
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.660]   with this horrible, smelly fish,
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.620]   is that gonna help us with the goal
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.620]   of getting this project done?
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.460]   No?
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.700]   Okay, then perhaps we should focus on fixing the problem
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.820]   that got caused by the fact that this person did something
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.740]   that was so awful that it made me fantasize about
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.340]   hitting them over the head, the dead fish.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.660]   - But the fish funny.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:28.260]   - I have to say, there's also the possibility
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.540]   and maybe it's one in 100, one in 50, I don't know,
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.180]   one in 10 that your kid may suddenly say,
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.700]   I love coding.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.980]   I know that's me.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:41.060]   I love, it puts me in my happy place
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.300]   when I'm sitting in writing code.
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.140]   I just love it.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.580]   - Well, the first year when we took my God kids,
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.540]   they wanted, right afterwards,
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.060]   they wanted to become video game developers.
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.580]   And then when they did the last one with the robots,
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.260]   they wanted to start creating nanites.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.140]   So like it escalates rapidly.
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.140]   - We need people who understand technology
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.460]   and can manipulate it successfully
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.940]   'cause who's gonna write our next great fart app?
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.700]   We got somebody, somebody's gotta do it.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.060]   - Nanite farts, Leo, you got it.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:03.900]   - Nanite farts.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.820]   (laughing)
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.500]   - So today brought to you by WordPress.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.620]   Somebody, a guy named Matt Mullenweg,
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.540]   first set up WordPress many moons ago
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.180]   and I was a WordPress user way back when,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.140]   in fact, I just got in the WordPress.com app.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:23.500]   I just got my 12 year badge at WordPress.com.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.420]   12 years I've been using WordPress.com.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.820]   Even in years before that, I used WordPress on my own server.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:29.660]   And I have to say,
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.740]   I really, having the experience in both ways,
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.460]   WordPress.com is 100 times better.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.300]   First of all, that server was expensive,
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.540]   a lot more expensive than WordPress.com.
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.980]   I was the one who had to install,
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.220]   run, configure, secure WordPress, add the plugins.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.860]   Hey, I learned a lot about WordPress
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.100]   and I don't discourage you.
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.700]   That's a great way to do it.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:51.220]   But as a result, I spent less time blogging
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.420]   and that's really what your website's all about
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.500]   is putting content up there.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.620]   So if you don't wanna become a web guru,
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.900]   you don't wanna pay extra to host your own server.
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.600]   You don't wanna spend a lot of time
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.780]   doing the security and software updates.
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.740]   You gotta go to WordPress.com.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.740]   Focus on your content, your site.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.900]   If you're an individual and you don't have a website
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.340]   with your name on it, you're missing the boat.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.380]   That Facebook page, that doesn't belong to you.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.820]   That belongs to Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:19.460]   That Twitter account, that doesn't belong to you.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.780]   That belongs to Jack Dorsey.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:25.780]   That medium, all these great places you can publish online
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.300]   are other people's sites.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.260]   You gotta have your site.
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.060]   And WordPress is your site.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.020]   You can upload images, video, audio and more.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.260]   It's stored on WordPress.com.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.820]   You can import and export content
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.260]   to and from your WordPress website.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.540]   So if you're putting videos up there,
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.420]   they're your videos.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.260]   They don't go away.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.580]   And I wish I had learned that lesson a lot earlier
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.100]   'cause I did use before WordPress word blogging software
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.180]   where I've lost images.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.020]   They're gone forever.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.220]   We were talking the other day about Mo-blogging.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.500]   I put a lot of images on text America,
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.020]   hundreds of them from the early days of tech TV.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.860]   They're gone forever 'cause I didn't own that site.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.740]   From now on, my content goes to WordPress.com,
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.660]   myleoloport.com blog.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.700]   If you've got a business,
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.820]   it's even more important that you have your place on the web.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.420]   A place where, you know, it reflects your business,
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.300]   your style, you put information.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.540]   If you're a plumber, you could put videos up there
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.820]   and how to fix stuff and how you guys work.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.100]   That's what people are gonna find when they search
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.820]   for your business name, your personal name.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.900]   You need to own that.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.500]   And then of course, you can grow your audience.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:33.580]   You can reach new customers.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.940]   They've got built-in search engine optimization
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.340]   at WordPress.com.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.660]   Social media features like social linking,
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.380]   which means your customers can share news and information
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.340]   about your business on their Facebook and their Twitter.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.620]   And that's awesome.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.260]   And you can launch your website with confidence
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:52.420]   knowing you can get help from a 24/7 support team.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.820]   Any time you need it.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.820]   WordPress plans start at just $4 a month.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.780]   Did you know 32% of every site in the world,
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.900]   almost one third of all the sites in the world,
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.580]   it'll be one third soon.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.580]   Run on WordPress.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.140]   There's a reason, one third of all the websites
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:11.700]   in the world, run on WordPress.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.020]   Right now, I get 15% off any new plan purchase
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:16.140]   when you go to our special URL.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.140]   Please use this that way they'll know.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.460]   You saw it on MacBreak Weekly.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.260]   Go to WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:27.660]   WordPress.com/MacBreak to create your website.
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.660]   And get 15% off a brand new site, WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.100]   I love having leoeloport.com.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.460]   In fact, I have all these blog posts in process,
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.980]   one of which I just wanna write down.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.620]   And I was gonna do it for this week.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.460]   I didn't get around to it,
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.180]   but maybe in a future MacBreak Weekly,
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.700]   a list of all the command line apps I use,
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.820]   Homebrew to install on my Mac.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.500]   And why I've installed them.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.060]   And there's more than two dozen.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.940]   I've started that post.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.500]   That's a perfect example of something
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.420]   where I could put something on WordPress.com
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.660]   that I can't do in the detail I'd like to on the shows,
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.420]   but I can refer you to from the shows.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.540]   Yeah, there's some really cool
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.740]   Homebrew command line apps out there.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.980]   Andy, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.340]   - No, I just wanted to add that I go,
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.020]   I've been blogging since before.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.620]   There was a word for blogging.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.460]   And I wrote my own CMS out of AppleScript
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.940]   and then other software that was the last
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:29.100]   really huge programming project that I built and maintained.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.860]   And then I switched to like a self-hosted WordPress site.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.860]   And last year, I started for a new project.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.820]   I tested out a WordPress hosted site.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.260]   And I'm not gonna be a hero anymore.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.100]   - No.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.300]   - It's so much.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.540]   It's just as you say, all I have to do is blog.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.060]   And the mistakes that I make will do nothing
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.300]   to compromise the stability or security of the site.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.260]   It will just make my site look ugly
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.300]   because I chose bad fonts in the bed.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.740]   (laughing)
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.620]   And that's so, that's such a relief, Leo.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.980]   - I know.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.540]   - And then by the way, you blog more
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.420]   because you spend less energy, you know, tweaking
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.220]   and more energy putting content up.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.940]   - And also when I start getting like 100 tweets,
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.140]   oh, did you know that I'm getting PHP scripting errors
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:17.980]   on your site?
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.820]   - Oh, God.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.620]   - Yes.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.460]   Okay, I guess what I'm gonna be doing
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.860]   for the next two or three days is trying to figure out
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.540]   what plugin is doing, what,
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.220]   whereas I could just yell at WordPress.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.540]   If under the incredibly unlikely scenario
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.180]   that my WordPress hosted blog stop working,
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.660]   it's someone else's problem.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.380]   And in this world, is there a better trio of words
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.060]   than somebody else's problem?
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.900]   - Yes.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.780]   - I don't think so.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.700]   - I, because I'm not on social media anymore,
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.980]   which has been a really great thing for my mental state.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.820]   I have to poke, but I still want to put pictures up, right?
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.660]   So, so easy.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.260]   You just, by the way, this is,
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.020]   so this, my WordPress front page has hero images
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:01.860]   from the past.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.100]   This is a, this looks like a Photoshop.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.380]   This is a real image of a giraffe.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:09.180]   I was at the San Diego Safari Park
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.860]   and then giraffe stuck its head over
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.100]   to see what I was doing on my phone.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.500]   And you know what, giraffes were--
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   - Staying your password.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500]   - Got my password, that password.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.300]   That looks like a really shifty, shifty giraffe.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.140]   - I know.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.220]   This is a WordPress template called 2017.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.420]   It's really, I could put pictures up there.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.060]   So easy from the WordPress app.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.900]   This is a slideshow from SmugMug
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.700]   that's easy to import into WordPress and post there.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.940]   You can see I've also posted links on the right.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.780]   There is, is my news link.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.500]   So when I, when I put a news story up,
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.820]   it automatically goes there.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:47.420]   There's just a lot, there's the photos from Flickr in there
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.060]   and the shows that we've just put out.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.580]   Oh, I should mention,
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.780]   we just put out Valley of Genius episode 12
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.420]   with Andy Hertzfeld.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.260]   That's a good one.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.740]   You, you, Apple people will wanna hear that one.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.580]   So I just, I really love having a blog.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.580]   I, I forgot how great it is.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.340]   And not doing social media really has helped
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.980]   give me more time.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.820]   So to post there, I think that's better.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.820]   I own those pictures.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.740]   I won't lose them.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.900]   God, that broke my heart when text America.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.740]   Do you remember that?
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.940]   Mo-blogging?
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.940]   Maybe that's just me.

[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:26.580]   well. So it's just it, the other ones I find are a lot more too complicated. They do a
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:31.680]   lot of other things that I don't want to do. And I don't know if you haven't done toaughter
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.780]   intervals. They're really hard. Oh my God. My trainer makes me do them. It's the worst
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:40.220]   day of the week to Bob a Friday. LEARN
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:46.160]   Oh, I do some what is it? It's like high intensity, right? It's it's hit. Yeah, it's hit. Here's
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.600]   the crazy thing about the growth of it. I explained, I was trying to explain to my kids, what
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.000]   I was doing with Tabata. And they're like, my son looked at me and goes, Oh, that's
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.840]   hit training. We do that like once a week. It's like he was completely like, yeah, intensity
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.200]   interval training. But Tabatas are, I don't know, they're worse. You have eight sets,
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.660]   typically. I mean, most common is eight sets and you have 20 seconds of full intensity
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:12.420]   workout and then 10 seconds of rest and then 20 seconds on to 10 seconds off. And you'd
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:17.140]   be surprised at how little weight you can do, you can use to to completely wear yourself
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:21.800]   out in eight sets. But you need something to do the timing. I mean, that's why I do it
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:28.440]   with my trainer because he'll do the timing. But we'll do it on a rowing machine or a bicycle,
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:34.120]   anything that a ropes machine or the battle ropes, anything that really exerts you. But
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:38.480]   you need the timing. That's critical. Yeah. And so and what's nice about this one is
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.880]   it doesn't interfere. If you want to listen to your own mix, I'll be listening to Spotify
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:46.840]   and playing this over top of it. And it kind of just ducks a little bit just as it's talking.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:51.940]   And so you can have it all kind of running together on your iPhone with your AirPods
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:58.300]   and everything just works. And you can set it up, of course, you can make the sets longer
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.980]   or shorter. And it's really, really, it's just easy. I'm not a huge fan of the, you
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:06.460]   know, I think that they haven't updated the interview.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:12.160]   It was a little wonky. Well, it's just a little dated. You know, it just flattened
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.820]   all of those things. We would think it would look modern. Right. So, you know, it looks
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:18.460]   modern. It looks fine there. And then you can put it on the screen if you want to. And
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.740]   so so that yeah, everything looks a little, it's a little dated, but it's still, I looked
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:25.660]   at the other ones. I was like, I haven't looked at new ones for a long time. So I download
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:31.300]   it all of them. You're all welcome because it costs me like $20 to buy, whatever. And
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:34.180]   so, and I looked through them on. I'm like, Oh, this is too complicated. This isn't, you
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.060]   know, this doesn't do what I wanted to do the interview. You know, and it's just, it
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.060]   needs to stay simple because otherwise, you know, you're trying to do something that
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:43.780]   you're really tired. So you don't want to have to, that has to be something you can
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:47.580]   just kind of set down in front of you and work through it. And it still works better
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.900]   than any of the other ones that I've that I've used in my opinion.
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:55.940]   And it works on modern iOS as well. Because I, I mean, they haven't updated in six years.
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.780]   It doesn't look like they've updated it. Maybe they will now after I've talked about it on
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:04.660]   the show, but I'm using the newest, I'm using, you know, an XS Max and that's the key. And
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:08.140]   I'm the new operating system. And it's all working perfectly. In fact, it works better
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:11.500]   than I will leave them nameless right now because I'm talking to their support people.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:16.900]   But it works better than some other fit programs that I've been testing for as interfacing
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:21.420]   with, I have a pet peeve of turning off my music while I'm, you know, why you're trying
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:25.380]   to tell me something I don't need you to tell me anything. I just need you to just be quiet
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.220]   and tell me, you know, like just go over top of the music. Right. It's fine. Yeah. Okay,
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:35.060]   Alex, time to rest. That's it. Yeah. I think we should make it to about a Tuesday's here
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:41.460]   on Mac break weekly. Nice. All of you do. I'm, you know, you guys are in good shape.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:47.380]   All I could say was like, I thought the body's in a long time and I did deep squats as fast
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:55.580]   as I can. And I couldn't really walk for like four days. That's another thing. Monday's
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:39:00.820]   leg day for me. I'm waddling around the studio. I do not like leg day. Leg day is no good.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:07.540]   It was all week. I did it on Thursday. Yeah, it takes a little bit of fall Tuesday. I was
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:20.020]   just any and I go pick of the week. I'm just now hungry for tapas. I don't care. You do
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:25.300]   your fitness thing. I'm going out for tapas. Another food related thing we're talking about
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:29.980]   the $3,000 bottle of cognac. I just wanted to point out that if you go to Amazon, if you
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:34.900]   want to eBay, you can buy the empty bottle, the signature empty bottle and the presentation
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:43.020]   case for like a hundred bucks, 200 bucks, fill it with whatever you want. And if people,
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:47.980]   if people leave to the conclusion that the plastic bottle liquor store bourbon that you
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:54.140]   bought and filled it was actually the Louis the 13th cognac. That's on them because you
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:40:02.140]   never said this was the Louis the 13th to $3,000 cognac. Wow. So I'm just saying that's
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.900]   the only way to go. Because I think you're not the one that is going to be coming out
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:15.100]   on December 23rd, I want to find Louis the Louis the 13th. I'm going to Willy B's tonight.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:19.660]   And if they have it, I'm picking it up. It will be here. I will find a way. I've never
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.500]   had it. I've always wanted to try it. I hope it's better be good. I have had it. It was
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:34.500]   quite good. Okay. Do we need some cars to Alex? Oh, yeah, probably. John's not going to let
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:41.980]   us have cigars in the studio. Come on. We got the molecule. Got a wire camera. Put you
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:47.900]   outside. We'll sit up there and just do the show outside. So we're going to have cigars
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:57.460]   and cognac. I like that. And my actual software pick is this really cool reading app called
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:05.940]   Bookly. Like imagine a fitness app but for reading where it's like you tell it the books
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:09.700]   that you're reading or the books that you have but haven't gotten to yet. You can scan
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:14.260]   the barcode or you can just get the information online and you can set it will give you goals
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:18.540]   for how many how much time you want to spend reading per day. It will give you like performance
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:24.220]   stats. It will say, Hey, if you keep on track, you'll finish this book in the next four days.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:29.100]   And it's like it really made me think that there should be like a ring on the Apple Watch
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:34.940]   for I really, really, really have been trying to just to Finnegan's wake. I would like to
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:39.060]   get finished with Finnegan's wake and see like the next you made your reading goal. You
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:44.580]   made you made your goal of actually using your brain to read a book because I am a kind of
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:50.940]   a book hoarder. I will buy books when they are cheap and put them like sort of in the
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:55.220]   bank for when I have time or when the mood hits me. And as a result, I sometimes forget
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:59.700]   that I have all these great books kind of piled up. And so this whole the bookly will
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:03.780]   like help me remind me that here these here these eight books you kind of started but you
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:09.660]   haven't made much progress with. And it'll even it's it's just really, really well done.
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:14.180]   It'll even when you finish a book, it'll give you like it'll generate this cool like sort
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.860]   of like infographic that you can then like put on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:22.740]   So you get so you not only do you does it give you like the sort of like shield awards
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:26.940]   you get on the watch. But also it lets you sort of needle your friends just like you're
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:31.140]   on your Apple Watch. You can needle your friends into saying that, Hey, look, I'm exercising
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:36.620]   way more than you are. And there are other apps like you might think about good reads.
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:40.940]   You might think about other apps that are for like sort of like hobbyist readers. The
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:46.060]   nice thing about this is that this isn't connected to another platform. The privacy policy looks
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:52.660]   pretty sound if not 100% clear one not there is a lack of 100% clear statement that says
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:57.820]   we have apps. And we we collect your data for just the purposes for which you're using
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:02.660]   this app. And then we actually printed out on paper and then eat that paper to make sure
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:10.020]   that no one gets their hands on that information. But the free level has a has enough good features.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:15.020]   I think that there's a it's $30 a year if you want to use unlimited books and unlock
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.860]   features that are kind of nice but are outside of its main Bailey wick of here are the books
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:23.140]   that you've got on your nightstand. Let me let us help encourage you to get make your way
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:29.100]   through all of those books. So cool stuff. Nice. I need that. My book stand. I can't even
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:33.740]   see it anymore. There's it's piled on and it's and it's got to be more comfortable than
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:39.340]   that leg day squat to Bula whatever thing that you're doing. Oh, it's to bully Tuesday.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:42.060]   Oh, I can get behind.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.740]   Oh, after after top us. I like the way this is working out.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:50.180]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:54.020]   So we mentioned it earlier, Leo, and you know, I just had to do it and it is the Pokeball,
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:59.980]   the Pokeball plus. You know, I have a little bit of a problem. I got it for Lisa for Christmas
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:05.180]   and then she just told me the other day she's quit Pokemon go. I guess that means it's
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:12.860]   mine. Yes. Yes. Or you can use it to tempt her back. You can you can just angle it.
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:18.620]   She she quick. Exactly. She quit Pokemon go. She could afford like a watch for gift.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:22.980]   But you sold your watch. You got to forward to buy her a Pokeball.
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:27.900]   It's so so anyway, so there was there was a Pokemon go plus for a while for a long time,
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:31.220]   which was a little device you word on your. Yeah. And you would you would press it to
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:36.620]   pins to spin polka stops or to throw poke balls to catch Pokemon. This one is similar,
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:40.740]   but it it spins the polka stops automatically for you. So you don't have to worry about
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.420]   that. You just have to walk past them and they will. Oh, I like that.
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:48.460]   So magically spin for you, but it doesn't it's not like that hacked version of the me
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:52.620]   fitness band that does everything automatically and suddenly you're out of poke balls. This
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:57.060]   still you press the button to catch Pokemon. If you so choose to catch them, you don't
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:00.740]   have to. So you can just walk and spin your stops and catch on your own or you can press
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:05.140]   the button whenever it vibrates and have it catch caught for you. If you're playing
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:09.740]   Pokemon, let's go. It also comes with me, which is one of the mythical or the mythical
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:14.060]   Pokemon from Jen one already caught inside it. So you can import him into your game
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:18.820]   and have a little bit of a head start. Do you get a mew after you evolve it? Can you
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:23.420]   put it in Pokemon go? You can't so you can transfer from Pokemon go to Pokemon. Let's
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:28.980]   go on Nintendo. You cannot transfer back the other way. So it no. So I would always be
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:32.980]   very considered and reserved about what you just like. You might say I'm putting all
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:36.220]   my shinies. I'm putting all my good Pokemon and then realize you can't get them back.
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:42.180]   Yikes. So I would be conservative about how much you transfer over. Yeah. I didn't realize
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:46.060]   it auto spins. I'm taking it to your eye. I'm taking it back. I'm taking it to New
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:52.140]   York because what better place to auto spin? Poke stops than downtown Manhattan dance urban
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:57.580]   areas of the best. My bag will be full. I have to expand my bag. Do it. I just did that.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:03.380]   Oh, I expand it all the time. I can't. The problem is there's never enough balls. That's
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:06.940]   the problem. Well, they just increased it. So it was 1500 for a while and I was living
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:11.100]   at 1499, which is just no way to live. And now in the last week, they've increased it
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:17.820]   to 2000. And apparently it was crashing it for it is a fun game. It is not always a stable
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:21.860]   game. I have a woman call me on the radio show. I mentioned that she and her daughter
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:27.140]   played and she wanted to know if she should get a new phone because her internet was terrible
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:32.820]   when she played Pokemon Go and I said, no, that ain't the phone, baby. All this week,
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.500]   it hasn't worked on Wi-Fi like it won't finish loading the game on Wi-Fi. It turns off Wi-Fi
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:41.620]   and it's just loading fine. That's just the worst. That's why I'm looking forward to
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:47.540]   Warner Brothers Harry Potter version of Pokemon Go. That'll be out next year. Yeah, it was delayed.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:52.060]   Yeah, it's coming out next year now. Then I'll buy a wand. And it's supposed to be like
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:55.940]   a magic beast and where to find them. You go and catch that Griffin and you catch that
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:47:01.100]   spike up. Yeah. Now the worst, my worst case scenario is they just take Pokemon Go and
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:06.780]   skin it with all the bugs and everything to persist. But my best case scenario is they
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:10.420]   rewrite it from scratch. So it actually works. That would be nice. I think they're using
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:15.100]   Nantix engine and they've always used Unity as the display way to translate their engine
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:19.820]   into an actual game. But the I think we've seen some footage and it looked quite different.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:23.460]   So my expectation is going to be low. I'm going to be cautiously pessimistic about this
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:28.460]   whole thing. And then hopefully they'll surprise me. I said, I didn't play Pokemon as a kid
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:33.140]   or even as an adult. So I don't share that nostalgia for that. But my do for Harry Potter.
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:37.380]   My pick, I'll do it real quick because we want to get out of here. It all started with
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:41.500]   this article in The New York Times, the mystery font that took over New York. I bet Montréal
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:47.620]   and Cambridge too. It's that weird font you see on all the sushi restaurants that kind
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:56.940]   of looks a little Chinese. It's called chalk. It was invented in 1955 in France by Roger
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:03.540]   Ex-Kofan, a French typographer. And for some reason, it's just cut on. It's everywhere.
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:08.500]   Every Chinese restaurant, every sushi restaurant, they all use chalk. And I loved this article
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:14.100]   because first of all, The New York Times writing about typefaces is awesome. Right?
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:18.820]   And at least it's not Mistral. Yeah, or Helvetica. I mean, it's interesting. At least it's not
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:23.100]   cartoon sands. Somebody's going to write that story. Comic Sans. Why do you still see that
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:26.420]   everywhere? It's hard to believe. It is a virus.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:33.660]   And then I thought, well, maybe my pick should be the font because anybody uses code engines,
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:39.500]   you know, editors X code or works in terminal is always looking for a good programming font,
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:42.860]   you know. And I actually found one now. I've put everywhere. I even use it in our chat
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:49.020]   room. It's called input and it's free from the font bureau, input.fontburo.com. They sell
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:55.420]   a lot of fonts and it's free for non-commercial use. Designed by David, Jonathan Ross, it
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:49:02.500]   has a mono spaced font, a proportional font. It has a huge range of widths and styles and
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:09.940]   faces. I mean, I can it can go on and on and on. This thing just is endless. And I just
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:15.180]   love it. There's a serif and sans serif version. It, of course, is a programmers font with
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:20.260]   the requisite slash through the zeros. Actually, I think it's a dot in the zeros and it's really
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:24.820]   does a nice job. And it is free. So I thought maybe I just mentioned this. Programmers are
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:29.980]   often debating over what they're what's the best programming font and so forth. This is
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:35.180]   one I've really come to love input. And you can you can actually customize it if you go
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:43.540]   to the download page. Again, it is free with for personal coding or customizing plain text
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:47.100]   apps. It's not free for commercial use. And if you customize it, you could choose the
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:52.460]   styles, the families, you could select the character fonts if you read the faults. If
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:57.540]   you really hate the L's that look like ones, you can get an L with a like a little loop
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:02.660]   at the bottom. If you like slashes through the O's instead of dots, you can choose that.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:07.660]   How do you like your braces? It's all up to you. You can even do the line spacing and
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:13.100]   then download the fonts and they'll be customized. This is I really like this. They do offer
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:20.980]   you a chance to support the project by purchasing a license, but it's free for private use input.fontburo.com.
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:27.060]   I've added that to Furo Sands and Furo Mono and actually Furo Retina, which is quite good
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:31.860]   too. And all my other source code pro and droid and all the others. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:39.420]   recommend block block. Yeah, they'll be funded. Wouldn't it be fun to code in chalk? The mystery
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:46.100]   font. Yeah, just code code in that everything. It's taken over New York code in that. Maybe
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:52.580]   I will for a little bit at least run the chat room in in chalk. That'd be fun. Yeah, speaking
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:59.460]   of like programming fonts, I recently I found the most evil evil evil thing to do to a programmer
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:05.420]   because the Greek the Greek symbol for question mark is looks exactly like a semicolon, but
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.980]   it's its own Unicode character. So what you do is you go into their code, you change a
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:16.220]   random semicolon to the Greek question mark. And then they wonder why not why their entire
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:21.380]   why their code works. Well, at all, none of their code works. It's like, Oh, that is
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:26.620]   delicious. That is a movie worthy of a Romulan. That's you almost wouldn't you almost wouldn't
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:30.700]   be mad. Oh, man.
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:37.540]   Oh, and the Enoco. He's the evil genius at Enoco.com. You also catch him in WGBH in Boston every
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.420]   week talking about tech. And of course, every Tuesday right here, he also has a number of
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:46.580]   other podcasts, including an Android show. We won't talk about it called material. So
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:52.980]   good on relay.fm. It's with the amazing flow ion. It's also another another another
[01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:59.540]   twit. She's on all about Android. So it may sound rustled right out of there. It's amazing.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:05.700]   Yeah, relay.fm. We don't plug that enough. All you guys have your own podcast or an
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:11.460]   Ritchie's got vector at i'more.com/vector. And of course, he writes for i'more and is a
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:15.940]   very welcome guest every Tuesday here. And we got to go up to Montreal and do the show
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.980]   up there. We can all please please do. I think that would be so much fun before the end.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:26.820]   The end is nice. Let me see here. Who else? Oh, that's you. And like Lindsay from the
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:30.780]   Pixel course sitting in front of what is that mountain? That's a pretty mountain. I don't
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:34.660]   know. I don't know. I think that was someone that's got Christmas tree and someone's got
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:40.580]   the pretty in front of it. I guess very festive. If you best way to follow what Alex is up to
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:49.940]   is to follow him on the Twitter. A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y. Ladies and gentlemen, we do Mac break weekly

[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:26.620]   Pro. Oh, look, Renee. I wonder how do you hatch an egg by sitting in a chair for two
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:33.580]   hours? No one knows. Well, it links into the health app on iOS and Android now so that
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:37.140]   it'll even when the app is off, it'll account all the steps and stuff you do during the day
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:41.460]   and you've got it. I know I love that. That's the adventure mode. Oh, look at the little
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:49.940]   skitty. Brand new little skitty just for me. Oh, that's a Meowth. Never mind. Meowth.
