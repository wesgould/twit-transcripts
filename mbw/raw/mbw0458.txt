[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly the day after WWDC.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.240]   I think we've digested it, we've researched it, and we've got a great panel to talk about
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.240]   it.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.040]   Dan Morin, Jason Snell, Aaron Hillagast from the big nerd ranch in Ani and Aco and I.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.200]   We'll talk Mac, we'll talk Apple, we'll talk Swift.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.200]   Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.280]   know, the day after WWDC actually still going on.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.360]   There's a lot of Apple news.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.160]   So we have the largest panel of all time here.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.280]   And should we do this every time there's an Apple event, don't we, Jason Snell's back?
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   The mega panel.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   The mega panel.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   Sixcolors.com.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.880]   And he brought another six-colorer, Dan Morin.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.400]   Also formerly a Mac world guy.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Indeed.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   Good to be here.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   I'm on the show.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   I have once, I think.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.040]   I was, but I was ahead in a box.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   I was ahead in a box.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.240]   So it easily forgettable.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.120]   Speaking of heads in a box, Andy Inako is here.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.440]   He's always ahead in a box.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.800]   I try to just be me, Leo.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.520]   And I'm really glad they have Aaron Hillagas here.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.760]   And that's why I'm wearing a hat because I had had envy.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.920]   He's from Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.560]   You said you were going to be a monastery?
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.320]   Do you have a tonshire instead of a hat?
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   The idea was, yeah.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.040]   But you decided the monastery name was not going to work at all.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.240]   So we thought of the "C" Slickers movie.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   Like people were treating from the world.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   Oh, I like it.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's like a fantasy coding camp.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   Exactly.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   It really is a good idea.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920]   In fact, I think it was one of your books you said.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.080]   Get a good night's sleep.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   People forget that.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.480]   Coffee is no substitute for sleep.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.760]   And this is really hard.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.720]   And this is hard, but it's fun.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   And fun.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   And everybody, Alex Lindsay's done it.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.520]   And everybody who's done it says it's great.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   We're really proud.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.840]   The newest book in action.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.520]   I'm glad you're here because you can explain what's going on with the Swift.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   The newest book.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.760]   Coco Programming for Mac OS X 5th Edition focuses not on Objective C but on Swift.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   Right.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.240]   This is the first book we've shipped with Swift.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.440]   And it's great.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.480]   We're really excited about Swift.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.560]   Well since we're swifting, let's go right into it.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.280]   We're going to talk about everything Apple announced today.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.400]   We'll probably spend a long time on music.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.960]   Oh, I hope not.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   Wow.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   They did.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   They sure did.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   The Dives.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   We just played some music.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   I promised no.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   What was the song lost?
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.880]   We did dance your face off.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.920]   Is that Bill my face when I went to the real?
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920]   I can't feel my face.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   The hell was that?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   I have no idea.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.120]   Anyway, well at least you didn't have to have a band.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   That saved him money.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   They had a laser.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   They had a laser.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.760]   Watch out for the death raise.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.560]   Swift 2.0 announced.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   What's the difference?
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.920]   So there's just a lot of things that got tidied up.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.760]   One of the things that we were all wondering about was exception handling for example.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.880]   When something goes dramatically bad.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.480]   We really didn't have a good story for how we were going to deal with it.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.080]   Sometimes you want that for tests, right?
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   For unit testing.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   You want to be able to try stuff.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.320]   You want to stop immediately as soon as one assertion fails.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.960]   You want it to stop right there and let you know what.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.400]   So it didn't have that kind of.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.440]   Didn't have a good answer.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.840]   Modern programmers want that for sure.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   We do.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.960]   And it very much followed what was already happening in sort of the C++ objective C world
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.480]   idea of throwing exceptions and catching them further down the stack.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.560]   Not that you plan to have failure, but you want to handle it well.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   That's right.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.000]   They just tidied up a lot of little things.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.120]   It was one reason though people were nervous about Swift because they even Apple at the
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   time when they announced Swift said this is a language in development.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.360]   It's hard to throw your energies into a language that's not done.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   That's exactly right.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.280]   I mean for us, imagine that every time they roll out a new version of Swift we have to
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.880]   go through and figure out every place where we have to update our books.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.280]   So do you feel that it is close to finished?
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.200]   Or it's getting close to stable and stable and speckable.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.720]   Now they said also open source.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.400]   Now I'm going to tell you what I said first so you can poo poo it.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   Go ahead.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.440]   I said BFD because Objective C is open source.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   That's right.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   People are running to use Objective C anywhere but in the Apple universe.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.800]   What is on the other hand, Swift people have said might be a great teaching language.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.440]   Swift is a very pretty language.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   Especially to the playground.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   But the playground wouldn't be open source.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.880]   The playground would not be open source.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.440]   But the idea is that you probably could implement something like the playground on top of a
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.120]   REPL of mankind.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.600]   So is open source a big deal?
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   I don't think so.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   No.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   It was a big applause line.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.360]   It is a nice language and it does send out a message that it's not a proprietary thing.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.440]   It is being opened up and that's nice.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   But languages have niches.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.240]   And if you're talking about modern languages at the moment, like Go is a really nice server
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   side language.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.000]   It has really clever concurrency support.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.760]   On the client, we look at Rust.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   Rust is a really nifty high performance language that the Mozilla Foundation is creating.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.200]   Yeah, 1.0 just came out.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.880]   It has a lot to do a lot in common with Swift.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.880]   Really interesting.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   And so interesting.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.120]   They think Rust is a systems programming language more, right?
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.120]   That's true.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   But I was just...
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.120]   It's an application programming language more.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   Okay.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   I mean, what do you even need a systems programming language for with Macintosh?
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.680]   You're not writing systems software.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.720]   So, people use the word in different ways.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.240]   But when you talk about systems versus applications, often you're talking about the ability to
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.160]   get down to the individual bytes.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.440]   And there's actually more support for that inside Swift 2.0 than there was before.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   Interesting.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440]   So, for example, function pointers, you can pass those around.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.160]   I always think of Apple programming as being mostly API calls, mostly calls to what we
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   used to call the ROM.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.560]   That's a really interesting change in programming in general, is that you still write a lot,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.160]   a lot, a lot of code to make scrolling happen.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   It's all a library call.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.320]   So, you spend a lot of time just reading the library documentation.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.400]   What is Apple's commitment to open source?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.640]   Darwin is an open source project, the kernel that Apple runs on the mock kernel and the
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.360]   BSD stuff that Apple runs on.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.880]   That's all open source stuff.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.800]   And everyone's while you'll see that they're using libraries and databases from the open
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   source world.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Do they contribute back to Darwin?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   For sure.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.080]   I mean, the one that I think of is the low level virtual machine.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080]   Apple has done a lot of work on that.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   The end is huge.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.640]   In fact, Google is jumping on that bandwagon.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.240]   It is huge and Apple has done a lot of work on it.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   Interesting.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.440]   And WebKit, which is driving Safari as a resource project.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.800]   There's a web based on an open source project and then is itself an open source project.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.440]   I talked to one of our audience members a few weeks back, was one of the WebKit guys
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.440]   at Apple.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.760]   I said, "How do you feel about the open source community?
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.360]   They really feel like they're part of it.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.000]   They want to contribute back to it."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.360]   That's a great success story, actually.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.960]   Yeah, I think that's their best open source success story because they took, they were
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.120]   inspired by KHTML, which came out of the K desktop environment over Unix.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.640]   And then they improved it.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.120]   They checked in a huge, just this entire web browser project or at least HTML rendering
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.640]   engine and have continued to contribute to it.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   So yeah, that was their best hour, I think, in an open source.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   Yeah, I think so, too.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   What license does Apple use?
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.480]   I think there is a Darwin community license.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.720]   There's a Darwin license.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.640]   And presumably that's what they'd use for Swift.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.040]   I would imagine.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.280]   That's the big, that's when you get in the new grid.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.200]   Now that we've chased everybody away.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Let's talk, believe with your developing stories and your programming options.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's a development conference!
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.200]   And you invited a developer.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.440]   And I invited a developer.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.400]   So you know me, I like to nerd out with a big nerd ranch.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.360]   Andy and I were joined by George Dow from I'm More, who's great.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.160]   And Mike Elkin, yesterday, we sat here watching the conference.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.600]   You guys, you guys in the event?
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.160]   And Aaron, of course you were, I'm sure.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.280]   From the outside, I don't know if you'd agree with this.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:11.360]   I said this yesterday, but from the outside it felt like fairly disjointed bunch of stuff.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.880]   And then the music thing is completely out of left field.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.240]   Although one more thing you're always allowed to be, a little bit out of left field.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.560]   But like they spent time on, look, the new note application.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.280]   Well, that's important.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.880]   That's included in iOS.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.920]   And there was a nice statistic there about how half of the people who use the iPhone use
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.120]   the notes application, which was, I mean, that's a lot of people who use the iPhone.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.240]   So everybody is taking note of like where they parked in the parking garage.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.360]   I did that yesterday in the notes app.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.200]   It has to do lists and you can draw on it.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.160]   The structure was OK.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.480]   It was, you know, Mac OS, iOS and watch OS.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.200]   There's precedent.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.240]   I mean, remember Apple spent a long time talking about their cards application?
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.080]   Oh, yeah, that was a fine.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   That was a fine answer.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.160]   Wasn't that WWE is like, OK?
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.360]   And then they took it out.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.680]   This reminded me of the year that Snow Leopard came out.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.080]   And there weren't a whole lot of features.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.280]   They had done major repleming underneath to make things stronger.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.760]   But there weren't a whole lot of features that they wanted to really tout.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.720]   And this was one of those years where Apple tidied a lot of things up.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.240]   Right.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.040]   Did a lot of things that people were waiting for.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.680]   But there weren't very many features in that.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.680]   It felt really aimed.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.840]   Developer wise, too, in terms of breaking down here the three platforms.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.480]   Watch, iOS, Mac.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.760]   This is what we're going to focus on.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.240]   Here's how we're going to improve all these things.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:22.520]   I agree.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.600]   It's totally like a maintenance year in a lot of ways.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:31.160]   And I think Apple's hurt a little bit by the fact that this has become a major public event.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   And so like the iPad and iPhone announcement events.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.200]   So they have to do some announcement stuff.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.040]   But I would imagine if I'm a developer, I'd be much more interested in what we've cleaned
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.560]   up core texts so that you can handle Unicode strings a little bit better.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.080]   Things like that.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.560]   The developers really want to hear.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.240]   So you know, they've got dozens of other sessions, too.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.200]   The second session is always the all developer all the time session.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.640]   That's the state of the union session.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.120]   The first one, they walk that line where they want to be sort of developer-centric,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.280]   but they also know that the eyes of the world are watching them at that point.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   That hurts them a little bit.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   Google has the same problem with Google I/O.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.040]   It becomes a public event.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.720]   Then you can't really use it in a way that developers would most--
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.960]   And I think that's why Apple's trying to shift the hardware more and more towards its own
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.480]   events, right?
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.560]   The fall events.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.120]   Let's not-- because the iPhone used to be announced at WWDC.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.480]   They've announced several revisions there.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.000]   And that's tough because then people get to expecting that.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.880]   And thinking, oh, there's going to be a new iPhone this year.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.240]   And they have to manage expectations.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.000]   So focusing mainly on software, I feel like--
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.280]   Bring back World Expo.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.000]   I think that's where that should be announced.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.520]   Andy, what were you going to say?
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.800]   I was just going to say, I mean, actually, the Google I/O keynote was a good case in point.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.640]   Because there were all these diverse elements that Google had to present, including flying
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.840]   internet and driverless cars.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.920]   But they did decide that the one landing point they really wanted put in there was who
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.760]   are the next billion users of Android going to be.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.880]   And there are almost every segment that they presented tied into that in some way.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.760]   So that gave it a better sense of consistency, at least for someone outside to be watching
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.680]   this sort of stuff.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:10.560]   I think the biggest problem as a communications event for Apple's keynote is that they still--
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.920]   they have these fall events in which everybody's going to be hyped up about the new iPad or
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.200]   the new iPhone.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   But this is the one time in which they get to say, this is who we are.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.560]   And this is what our view on technology and the world is and the relationship between
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.800]   humans and technology.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.840]   So this is a really good opportunity to land those points, to till that soil and tell the
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.040]   story of not only of the things they're announcing today, but the things they're going to be
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.200]   announcing a year from now.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.000]   And I think that the big problem, the only big problem about this one was they landed
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.640]   on such a dud.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.200]   I mean, a half hour telling us about basically-- and here's a feature that you're familiar
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   with on Spotify.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.640]   You're so familiar, you've been using for years on this other service and also with people
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.040]   who are not quite as polished as the other presenters you've seen.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:03.200]   So when you wind up the party where you're going to have the 30 minutes of, we know this,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.600]   you're confirming things we already know, you're showing us things we've already seen
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.800]   from all kinds of other places before, it's also going to sort of be the last-- the last
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.400]   impression is not going to be the best impression.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   I was just a little disappointed that they didn't use more of Bill Hader in the keynote.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   He was good.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   He was good.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.000]   Did you see-- I'm wondering if people saw the video at the beginning, unless you actually
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.560]   watched the keynote, and most people are not going to go one and watch the keynote, you
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.400]   missed actually one of the most creative videos, let's play a little bit of it.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   It's probably most involved.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.000]   Yeah, I mean, this was really good.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   This was Bill Gates' quality.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And this is all context sensitive to the time.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I think I've always been a place.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And even the devices you're connected to.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   David LeGarry, director.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   David LeGarry, director.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   If it's not, it's Bill Hader's idea of life.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.600]   At the same signature camera work you're expecting to see in an Apple video.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   By the way, look at the mirror.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.280]   Where's the freaking camera?
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.000]   They did some sort of magic on that one.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I want to know where that sculpture in the back came from.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   That was pretty cool.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.560]   Let's show the disclaimer where we show we're violating Apple's copyright.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.400]   I think we're getting another audio from another tab too.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.800]   Oh, I thought that was part of the production value.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200]   It sounds like Steve Jobs.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   He's all around us.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   Where am I getting that from?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   Kind of familiar, but you're really not sure who it is.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   I'm going to announce.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   I have to keep that.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   What is going on?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   Who that person might be?
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   That was a great Federighi.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   There we go.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   There we go.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   But what?
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   No, okay.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   They must have...
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   I wanted to react to WW...
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   There's no camera in the mirror.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   They must have edited that out.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   It's always been attracted to risk.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   Maybe there is.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   Maybe that's not a mirror.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   Maybe it's a hole.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   Clever, hey.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   Oh, there's the back of his head.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   Unless they got another...
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   No, the person.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   I'll tell you something.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   No, I don't need all of this.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   Again, that's sculpture in the back.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   That's good Etsy stuff.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   I would pay $8.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   What is it?
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   It's like...
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   It's like...
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   It's like...
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   I've had many with the application icons cut out.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   But what this really was all about, and actually that's appropriate because really what this
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   is about, and I like the subtlety of this, is really to celebrate apps.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   Yes.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   This is my favorite part actually.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   Monument Valley.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   Monument Valley Crow is standing there.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   Well, it's nice because Apple tries to be funny a lot and sometimes it doesn't land.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   Right.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   And they did a good job with this one.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   They clearly hired someone to write it, which is a big deal.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   Even the keynote, I felt like there were people, there were jokes written in the keynote.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   Yeah, and sometimes those don't get delivered well.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   People talk about the dad jokes, right?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   I think that this, they clearly hired someone, possibly Bill Hader, to write it was kind of
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   savvy and good writes.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   This was well done.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   This was well done.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   These jokes from last time were horrible.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   Yeah, they got real little better this time.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   A little bit.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   Karaoke jokes.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   Well, we've talked about Eddy Q as a presenter and I think we can all agree he's maybe not
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   the Paul, most polished guy.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   I love this.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   They're debating the color back to use for the iPhone while this guy is literally burning.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   We'll take the gold.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   That's a nice moment where he doesn't make a decision, so she just makes the decision.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   Yes.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   No.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   Tender jokes.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   Oh, is that what that was?
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   Swiping.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   See, I missed a lot of the inside, the app stuff.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   A little drone giving him coffee.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   They're blowing it all over him.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   The head to Amazon.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Tim Cook, Joe.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   I love the elevator full of Tim Cooks.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   Again, I want to see the Craigslist ad that got all those people.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   I wanted one of the brilliant Tim Cook.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   Wouldn't that have been funny if he was in the back?
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   These are all apps here, right?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   What are these Egyptian mummies in the back there?
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   Do you know that?
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   Goate simulator, I love.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   Right.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   Goate.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   Goate.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   Goate.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   Goate.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Actually kill it.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   There he is.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   Hey.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   Hey, David.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   What have you got me into here?
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   Am I like a Victoria's Secret Sky?
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   You are an angel investor.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   You make millions off kids dreams.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   So I'm just a rich guy.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   You're a rich guy.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   Bring him up.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   No money falls out of him.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   It's the hardest cuts in circulation off of my legs.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   That's all right, buddy.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   No worries.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   [laughter]
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   Anyway, I think this probably a lot of people missed this because it was at the beginning
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   of the keynote.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   If you weren't at the keynote, you didn't see it.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   And people aren't going to rush to apple.com to look at the keynote.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   And then you're missing one of the best comedy bits.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   I hope they put this on YouTube.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   It was very well done and very funny.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   Danny Pooty from Community.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   [music]
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   There's a lot of people from TV shows on NBC that aren't doing well.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   Apple writes a pretty hefty check for this kind of thing.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   I got a fan.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   [music]
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   You must have just gotten chills.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   I do.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   I think it was when I was talking about objective C.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   Objective C.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   It showed up on a big bang theory once on the talk.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   Objective C did.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   I was like, "Oh my God."
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   Well, they actually had a little code in the back.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   [music]
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   You just level in that stuff.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   That would never have happened in Steve Jobs's day.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   [laughter]
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   Damn it.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   Okay, at least it's going to work right.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   It's sad because this began so well.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   And then you go to the end of the show and it ended so poorly.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   It's just in showbiz.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   Yeah, exactly right.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   But still.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   Yeah, exactly right.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   Although when you set it up like this, it starts to feel like showbiz.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   I used the word Bill Gates because he used to do -- and nobody would ever see these because they never got the rights and they were never released for convex and CES as Kenos.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   They would do amazing videos.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   But nobody would ever see them.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   There's one of -- remember that ad where the guys are driving around -- and they're driving around and they pick up an old --
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   Like a Volkswagen ad.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   It's a Volkswagen ad.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   They pick up an old sofa.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   They had Bill and what's his name?
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   You know, Steve Baller.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   Baller?
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   That's a baller.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   He's a baller now.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   [laughter]
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   Driving around in a Volkswagen house.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Yeah, Steve Baller.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   [sings]
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   And they're boppin' in the music.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   They're driving around in the Volkswagen.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   They see an old sun microsystems computer on the side.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   They throw it in the back.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   And they go -- and they're like, "What's going on?"
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   I mean, that's the kind of stuff I think people enjoy at Kenos.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   We'll talk more about what happened at the Apple keynote.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   There's quite a bit to say at WWDC.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   And we've got a good team of people to do that.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   I do want to talk about music.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   I'm savin' it.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   Because I think we're going to get into it a little bit with the music thing.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   You think?
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   Maybe we'll all be in agreement.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   I don't think we'll be in agreement.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   [laughter]
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   I don't think we'll be in agreement.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   All right.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Andy Inacos here, Jason Snell-Dan-Morn.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   And of course, wonderful to have Aaron from -- Aaron Heligas from Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   If you want to take a class at Big Nerd Ranch, Big Nerd Ranch.com, get the book.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   Right?
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace, where ironically you don't need to be a developer to get a site that looks like custom made, beautiful, like a pro did it,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   at an amazing price.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   It actually makes me weep when I think of what I spent on our new website.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   For eight bucks a month, I can have a Squarespace site.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   Ten plays that don't look templated.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   Elegant interface.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   24/7, customer support right from the Squarespace offices.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   And it doesn't matter if you're a coder.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   Now, if you are, they have a developer platform.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   Then the sky is the limit.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   Easy to use tools, very intuitive.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   Integrates beautifully with your social networks.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   If you're a photographer, you can put your pictures on Squarespace, use their portfolio app to show clients.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   They just make it easy.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   And by the way, state of the art commerce.

[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   We're talking on MACBreak Weekly.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   We're talking about Apple.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   And we're talking about the developer conference.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   Of course, you're going to announce that's re-announced iOS 9 and OS 10 10.11 El Capitan.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   El Capitan.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   El Capitan.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   We knew it was going to be El Capitan, right Andy?
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   Because they showed El Capitan.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   Yeah, we're guessing it early.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   The fun part of watching this keynote is always the brooder filming every frame of it and figuring out what decision.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Is this a message that Apple is saying by saying we're not going to choose another location in California?
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   We're going to zero in on one feature of the location we used for last year's name.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   It's still in Yosemite.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   Which is great because they did the Cocoa conference, the Yosemite conference last year this year.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   It was a big success.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   I was thinking about, "Geez, we're going to have to move the conference away from this really wonderful park to a new place next year."
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.200]   Nope.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   El Capitan.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   It really is in the...
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   Bring your pitons though.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   It's hard to climb.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   It's in the snow leopard mountain lion category, right?
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   Where they're really saying this is an update inside another update and it's so it's fewer features, more performance and bug fixes and things like that.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   That's definitely the message that they're sending with this name.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   They're bringing metal to OS 10.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   Metal, the idea you're programming bare to the metal is particularly used for gamers graphics and that is now part of OS 10.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   Everybody excited about metal?
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   I'm psyched.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   They showed the worst possible game.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   That's so bad.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   Because it wasn't demanding... it wasn't crisis.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   It was a cartoon game.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   It looked really retro.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   It looked like a really like early 2000 style game.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   The demo they did for iOS last year was beautiful and gorgeous and zen and garden.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   Look at all the leaves flowing through the trees.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   Look at all the movement of the sand and the rocks.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   This was okay.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   My nephews played this game to death.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   That's okay.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   I'm surprised actually that they didn't use Adobe.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   The Adobe announcement was really interesting because that's a fraught relationship there.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   A fraught history between those companies, especially over flash.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   The announcement was that Adobe engineers tested out the new metal stuff in After Effects and Illustrator.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   They got massive speed boosts in After Effects.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   In Illustrator, there were features in Illustrator where you zoom in and go like in the old days,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   all computers did this.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   You'd go from point A to point B and there'd be no transition because there was too much rendering
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   necessary there.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   You zoom in and you just cut to...
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   They were able to do that as a smooth transition now.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   It was like a real rigging endorsement of...
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   They said that they would use metal in all of their apps going forward.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   They would do that because on the Mac.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   That's great.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   I would have loved to have seen a little demo like that because that would have been impressive
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   stuff.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   I don't know whether that's Apple didn't want to Adobe on stage or Adobe didn't have the
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   software ready to go in a demonstrable form, but I would have rather seen something practical
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   like that, honestly, then a game that wasn't that impressive and was a long boring demo.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   It would even even look that good on an iPad.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   If you had seen that demoed as an iPad game, it would have been impressive.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   It wasn't challenging.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   It wouldn't have been super impressive.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   Go ahead, Andy, for a minute.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   And then Eric.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   We wrote a really nice piece for iMore this morning from a game developer's perspective
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.200]   about how, above and beyond, how end users might experience this.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   Content creators, for a lot of the reasons that Jason talked about, that you can actually
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   do 3D renders and see what you're doing while you're doing it, is going to make the next
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   generation of games and the next generation of creative content that much smoother and that
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   much easier to create.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   It seems like the biggest announcement of Mac OS was...
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   It was...
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   It was a big deal.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   Does it mean Photoshop's faster on the Mac now than it is on a PC?
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   I don't know that.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   Do we know that?
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   I don't know, but it means that it's more capable on lower capacity machines now.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   There you go.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   If they...
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   Because now you start to look at...
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   Is Apple trying to make leaner, cheaper, low, slower CPU machines more viable?
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   They can do it if they can not only make metal into a solution for games, but also a solution
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   for all kinds of creative content.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   Which goes well with the fact that they're not really changing the system requirements
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   that you saw, like both Al Capitan and iOS 9 will run on everything that their predecessors
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   ran on.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   So they're extending the life of computers that have been around for several years already.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   They were already getting kind of long in the tooth and these things can still run, maybe
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   not all the features that we're introducing, but...
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   Right.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   We see that.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   There's a lot of usability for computers that are six, seven years old.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   Users will be happy to hear that because they hate having to create their hardware just
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   because of the new operating system.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   So what does it mean?
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   Is it the end of OpenGL?
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   Well, that's the thing, is that we're really excited that we're going to get better battery
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   and more performance out of the machine.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   But whenever Apple abandons an open standard and says that OpenGL is not the thing anymore,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   we're going to start to think, "Well, am I going to be able to write code that will
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   run on the SteamOS and on the Mac and on the Windows in the future?"
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   But Apple's OpenGL implementation has always been horrible, has it not?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   It's gotten so much better than the last five years.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   It used to be very sluggish.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   And it was interesting when Microsoft went DirectX, a proprietary, very much like metal,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   a proprietary gaming interface, Apple said, "No, we're going to stick with open standards.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   We're going to stick with OpenGL."
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   And it heard them.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   I think it's one of the reasons a lot of games weren't written for the Mac.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   Maybe.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   Because if Microsoft, for instance, had chosen OpenGL and you could write a game in OpenGL,
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   it would work on both platforms, that would have been good.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   Microsoft didn't.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   They moved everybody to DirectX.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   Now Apple's saying, "Okay, well, we're going to move everybody to metal."
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   Right.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   But of course, they aren't getting rid of OpenGL.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   It's still one.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   You still have that.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   It's just that right now, there's stuff that's going to be directly to metal instead of through
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   OpenGL.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   Well, you worry that when it's not in the rendering pipeline for everything, the performance
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   is not going to be a vault with everything else.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   I feel like the end of OpenGL.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   What happens to OpenGL?
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   Is that related?
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   So their line is that you can do everything with OpenGL and OpenGL all inside the metal.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   So it is actually an integrated approach to that whole thing.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   Interesting.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   GPU acceleration.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   Okay.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   OpenCL was writing code directly to the GPU.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   That's right.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   Well, if it makes games better, I guess that's good.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   But even more importantly, if it makes designers happy, and there's still the question.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   There's always been that question.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   If you're going to be using Photoshop or Illustrator, which platform do you go with?
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   Windows or Macintosh?
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   For a long time, I think for the last few years, Windows has started to edge out Apple.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   I don't know.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   I kind of feel like with the Adobe stuff, especially, there's not much of a platform push or pull
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   there.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   Adobe stuff is on all the platforms.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   It looks the same.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   Pick the platform you like, and the Adobe stuff is there.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   The advantage they have on the PC side is that you can get more machine for less money, and
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   so you can have a better, more responsive machine.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.800]   So I suppose if you're a corporate buyer and you're trying to buy something for an installation,
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   but I think if you're just a user.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   We've watched through Edit stations.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   They're Dell work stations.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   If you're a user, it is, you use what you want, and the Adobe stuff will work on it just fine.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.720]   OS, we're not going to see iOS 9 until the fall.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.200]   We are going to see iOS 8.4 sooner end of the month, right?
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   It will bring besides Beats what?
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.200]   I don't think they discussed too much.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   What they said.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   The music thing sort of seems to be the big thing there.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   That's the whole thing.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   Apple music.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   Okay.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   The whole taco is Beats.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Apple music.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200]   Sorry, Apple music.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Radio on the internet.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   But that's still Beats 1.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.400]   But Beats 1 is the name of the radio.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   Yes.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   By the radio on the internet.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   Radio on the internet.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   It's going to be the big thing.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400]   We're going to have to talk about music.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   I could tell.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.800]   It's just people are just not going to let this go.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   All right.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.400]   Before we get there, can we talk about iOS 9 a little bit?
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   Yes.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.800]   I know we're going to just fall down the rabbit hole without the music.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   As soon as we get the music, it's over.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   I know.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   So iOS is just like the keynote.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   Sing.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   iOS 9.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   iOS 9.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   iOS 9.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   iOS 9.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.400]   My favorite news of the entire thing.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.040]   Because I've always been hoping for it's we've all been looking for Apple to explain
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.640]   what role the full sized iPads are going to have in the future.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   Given that sales are flatting out, given that it's not getting the sort of promotion
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   that used to be.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.960]   And also now that Intel is shipping really, really great fast low power chips, a power
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:02.200]   windows already manufacturers are showing off $500 windows tablets that do everything
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.600]   an iPad does technically on a table basis, not the same way it does it.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.920]   But if you're looking for something powerful, the cost, $500, $600 that can maybe take the
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.800]   place of your laptop for an afternoon or a couple of days, the iPad is just so annoying.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.040]   It's great in so many ways.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.680]   But the minimum amount of ways in which it's terribly annoying if you're trying to get
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.400]   work done is just a deal breaker so many times.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.120]   But now they've simply said, okay, we will give you a way to have more than one window
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.120]   on the screen.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.760]   And I'm going to give you most people have been talking about the cool trackpad features
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   on the keyboard.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.120]   But I was really more drawn toward the extended support for actual hardware Bluetooth keyboards.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   Simply the ability to just hit command tab and switch between apps that way.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.840]   That in itself I saw a lot that made me think weighing when he saw that.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.440]   Yeah, but what's the huge productivity blocker if you're on an external keyboard do have
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.800]   to take your hands off the keyboard and go and like get, grab the iPad and touch or use
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   that.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.360]   It's in your muscle memory as a beauty.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.800]   You bet me a hundred dollars that they ever show that on screen at a keynote.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.560]   Oh yeah, an application switch is just like on the Mac.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.360]   You know, I would never they'll never show a caps lock that makes the keys lower case
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   or uppercase.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.720]   What the hell they didn't mention that.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   It did not make it.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   It showed it.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   It's a big deal.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   It's one of the reasons why I travel.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.880]   I often travel with an iPad mini and if I was using an iPad as my one my one computer,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.840]   I would also have a big screen phone or an iPad mini.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.200]   So I could have that on the side and just use that to keep an eye on mail or just if
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.080]   I'm fact checking a checking a column, I can have a web browser open there.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   So they basically are going to start to ask really people should ask really really harsh
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:42.400]   questions about why would I want to buy a really budget rate Windows machine.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.040]   That's with an operating system that's still trying to figure out how to implement multi
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.200]   touch when you can have something that is proven tested when the best in class devices.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   It's cool.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.480]   It's got an Apple logo on it and for that three hours outside the office or one weekend away
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.360]   task it can do pretty much everything that you ask it to do.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.520]   It's going to be a hard question to ask.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.680]   And I get very interested now in the intersection of you know you look at the new MacBook.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.560]   It's super light, super thin and you start comparing that against like an full size iPad
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.440]   Air 2 with a keyboard and they're very comparable in terms of like how much space they take
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   up, how heavy they are.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.640]   And it becomes an issue of like five times more money.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.480]   Do you want yeah do you want to spend more money on a thing?
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   Which platform do you like better?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.840]   Do you want the flexibility of using a tablet or a laptop and it's but it's fascinating
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   because those are getting much closer together.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.320]   It is a departure because the iPad I always felt like the iPad was meant to be kind of
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   not a computer but kind of a more of a friendly device.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.680]   Well, I suppose to now you're adding windowing you're adding so many features that make
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   it a process.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   Not necessarily windowing.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.120]   I think they've taken the concept of windowing and implemented in a way that makes sense
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.400]   for a device like that which happens to be the exact same way that Samsung and Microsoft
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.000]   thought that was going to work by.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.880]   But who cares it is it's a way that I've used the a long time and it works really really
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   well.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.720]   You like it because you like this Microsoft calls it what's snap screen.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.280]   You like that those features though the ability to swipe in and add a window.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.800]   When you talk about the tasks for which a 10 inch tablet is designed you don't want
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.920]   14 windows all kinds of tool pallets you really just want again.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.080]   I want to have email on one side I want to have a web browser on the other side or I
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.640]   want to be able to watch video while I'm doing this other thing.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.440]   I thought that was pushing a little more the picture in picture.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.960]   Well it's such an obvious thing I mean also think about the times where you're on Skype
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.280]   or you're on FaceTime with somebody but you're doing something else at the same time.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.440]   Every time I talk to my mom.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.440]   I feel as though Apple.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.920]   Tell not looking at me.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.040]   Oh no I'm sorry mom I'm just thinking.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.640]   I feel as though Apple spent a long time trying to figure out a way to not do it that way and
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.440]   then find look there is no other way that's rather than having a floating window that covers
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440]   up some stuff.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.080]   Do we is it important enough that we have to do it this way.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   Fine we'll do it this way.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.800]   Is slide over the name you really want to use.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:59.120]   If you like me sliding over.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.240]   I'm going to force touch you if you keep that up.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.040]   These are the jokes folks.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   So I the trackpad thing that Andy mentioned it's fascinating.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.240]   The keyboard turns into.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.640]   So you put two fingers down on the keyboard and move it around and it's like you're using
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   the trackpad.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.560]   There's a cursor there's never been a cursor on iOS before right but they have this IBM
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.040]   cursor so it's for text selection only so so you can jump around.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.360]   The demo was amazing like Craig Federighi was like let me let me show you what I do
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.600]   here and and so and he's selecting text like so cool.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.920]   I kept expecting to go wrong and no he was on top of it.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.040]   No and on the current on the current iPad what you have to do is take one finger and
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.160]   you have to hold it down until you get the loop and then you got it and it's functional
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.920]   but it's slow and this is really fast.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   It does break the metaphor I've been thinking about this because it's the first time we've
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.480]   seen a cursor on iOS really but in fact remember when the iPhone came out it didn't even
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   have text selection.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   Exactly.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.480]   It didn't even have a carrot.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   Right.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.000]   That was something or copy and paste it took them a while to get all of those features
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.840]   and I felt like they were really trying to decide how do we do this.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.000]   But if you think the magnifying last the way it that was a brilliant.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.080]   Yeah so if you think about it so much of what we do interacting on these devices all
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.520]   the touchscreen devices is direct interaction right on a computer you are doing.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   You're manipulating.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.960]   It's always removed right you're on one surface and you're seeing the results on another
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:24.200]   surface but the keyboard is itself an abstraction right even the software keyboard you're typing
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.440]   down here in the letter show up up there.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.960]   So if you're going to do that I think it might as well go all the way.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.920]   I do wonder if at some point this opens the door to being able to pair like a Bluetooth
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.320]   trackpad or mouse so you can edit the insertion point with your Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.480]   iOS is moving towards OS 10 and OS 10 is moving towards iOS.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.600]   This is so much productivity update.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   I don't think we're going to converge.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.120]   I think they want them to be similar but I don't think they're going to converge.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   They want to be complimented.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   So you will use both.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.720]   It is a message that they are putting some effort into the iPad as a productivity and
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.360]   we all assume the base of the rumors that there will be a larger iPad on top of this.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.240]   That's really what this is about isn't it.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.000]   When they announced the iOS 9 they are also going to announce a larger iPad that really
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.680]   will it would be foolish to have a 12.9 inch iPad if you didn't have some of these productivity
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   features.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.880]   You'd really feel like it was a Fisher price toy.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   Giant app went.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.960]   It was just a giant thing.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   I'm glad they're doing this.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.120]   So if we're going for the conspiracy theory that they're merging let me point out one
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.160]   more data point which is byte codes.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.280]   So one of the things you'll submit to the app store is now this intermediate representation
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.240]   not fully compiled down to the machine code like a key code kind of key code sort of
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   a thing.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.400]   And the idea is that then in the future Apple can ship whatever process they want and
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   run it through.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400]   Wait a minute slow down, Captain.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.840]   So you mean if I am going to submit something to the app store I have to submit it.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.520]   It as binary fully compiled code and an intermediate code.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.120]   Even though there's no use for that byte code at this point.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   That's correct.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   Is that true for all apps?
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.600]   I don't know what the rules are exactly but it's only come only.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.360]   The idea is that we're going to do it.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:06.960]   Why the big swap processors out from under it could be running apps on Mac.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.520]   I'm sorry I'm just citing.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:14.960]   That is writing.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.920]   Apple TV maybe won't have the same processor maybe.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   Apple watch as well.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.560]   That's what I want on that CPU.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.760]   That would have been a headline item.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.240]   That would have been an absolute headline item if that were coming to Mac OS because then
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.840]   you look at the new 12 inch MacBook and you think this looks like something that was designed
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.560]   to have an ARM processor in it at some point.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   Wow.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   I didn't know that.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.000]   How do they start doing this?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.880]   This was just announced yesterday.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.480]   The other thing is app thinning.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.000]   Remember how you had to delete all those moves off your iPhone so that you could upgrade
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   to iOS 8?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Yes.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.280]   Well, that was a 4GB download.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   Now it's a 1 something gigabyte download and the way they're doing it is they're called
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   app thinning.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.720]   Right now your app is what we call FAT.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:05.320]   It has support for a lot of different architectures on the 64 bit, the 32 bit, the ARM 7, the
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   ARM 6.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.360]   And now it can strip out the parts that it doesn't need and just bring down the thin
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.360]   app.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   So I didn't know that easily.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.360]   The last thing I'd do is like power PC to Intel transition.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.360]   That's right.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.400]   So Dan wrote a great article on six colors about the stuff that they didn't say.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.480]   And I think what we're hearing is stuff, very interesting stuff, they didn't say.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.360]   There's never enough time for them to cover everything.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.040]   But they did not mention something that we thought they were going to mention which
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.760]   is rootless and trusted Wi-Fi, the security stuff.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   Especially on the Mac side.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.360]   Very little mention security I think.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.880]   And they left out a couple other security features they did introduce such as activation
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.560]   lock for the watch, increasing the security passcode.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.560]   But that's huge by the way.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   Activation lock.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.280]   Because there is a bug right now or a workaround where you can reset and erase a watch without
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.280]   a passcode.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   So that will prevent that.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   Well you think that's a bug that's not.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.720]   Well or it's a it's a unimplemented feature.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.520]   Unintentional consequence of the fact that they were not ready to ship activation lock
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.680]   for whatever reason.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.280]   What's fascinating to me is that that is something only recently added to the iPhones.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.520]   And yet we've to pet we now say we don't have that.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.600]   It really saved people from getting their iPhone stolen.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   It really reduced the market for stolen iPhones.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.520]   And obviously we need to put that on the watch as well.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.440]   It's kind of like a kill switch a little bit.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.800]   It requires authentication before you can start up your device again.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.280]   What other fine print as you put it?
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.120]   Well the battery life I'm excited about that.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.000]   They mentioned they mentioned it but I think it was just an aside and I was surprised that
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.240]   they didn't emphasize it.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.480]   They said they've been watching how people use their iPhones and based on.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   I knew they were watching.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.320]   They said they were watching you.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.080]   Their model based on the behavior of like regular people using their iPhone they've been
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.040]   tweaking the power settings and that claim they made on stage is that they've lengthened
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.760]   iPhone battery life by an hour with by one.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.120]   So that's not and that was unclear.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.400]   So it's not a button as it is on a Samsung device.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   No sir.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.320]   There is also there is also watch a reserve.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Right.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   Yes.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.120]   So I'm going to run with the iPhone which is Craig Federighi said flips all sorts of switches.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.520]   You didn't even know we're there.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.440]   And that's when you look at your phone it's a 20% and you're like oh man I'm going to
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.480]   run out of battery life emergency.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.600]   But they said in normal operation and one of the examples that came out yesterday is
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.280]   if you put your phone face down on the table and a notification comes in it doesn't turn
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   on the screen because it knows you can't see it.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   It knows.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.640]   Yeah you still have cameras in the accelerometers to figure out.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   Right.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.200]   So if they can do that I mean that seems kind of like a minor nerdy feature on how
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   do you demo that.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.240]   But that would that is a substantial impact on how all of us use our iPhones if our iPhones
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.000]   just suddenly get an hour more battery life.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   That's huge.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.600]   Andy observed this and I think you and I Andy are in a unique position having moved to Android
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.800]   and then because of the Apple Watch gone back to iPhones you immediately go wow the battery
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.440]   life on something that can't must have the tiniest little battery ever is really good.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.520]   I mean so much better than Android phones.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:04.400]   And I have to say I'm going to backtrack a little bit I've been kind of harsh on iOS
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.360]   and even more so on the kind of the closed nature of how Apple works.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.840]   Well you can't multitask.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.320]   Oh you can't do that.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   Well the advantage of that is by tightly controlling this they're really improving battery life.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.200]   It's not that there's a bigger battery they just because they control it so tightly you
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   can't have apps.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.440]   I think in Android everything's running all the time at once in the background conspiring.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.400]   That's not happening.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.000]   That's a real secret sauce feature that I don't think Apple promotes enough.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.080]   I mean all you have to do is spend three days with an Android phone to realize that there
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.280]   are punishments to freedom.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.720]   And sometimes I really wish I had that ball and chain around my ankle.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.840]   I mean it's it's it also speaks so well of Apple that they already have this phone battery
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:57.760]   where I've had loner hardware where especially on iPads where you know I'm testing it for
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.800]   a couple of weeks and then I put it away I'm back to using my real my my my my the iPad
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   actually own and then I go back to this like a week later and they're still like almost
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.480]   the exact same battery life that was before.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.800]   And it's and yet Apple has said that's not good enough we've figured out a way we can
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.040]   give you even more battery life.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.000]   We know that we're not selling we're not selling devices based on the battery life and we're
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.280]   already exceptional but here is we found a few nickels and dimes we went through the
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.800]   sofa cushion so here's here's your dollar eighty seven cents back.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.480]   Let's see I'm I'm telling you I'm saving music.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.880]   Don't try to get music in on me here.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.480]   I can't stop the music nobody can't.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.920]   I think it's kind of funny speaking of Android that now that Android has changed the name
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.000]   of its wallet to Android pay that Apple has changed the name of safe to call it around
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   the wall.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.760]   What is it what is it with this trend to make sure that no feature that's built into any
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.360]   company's phone will ever be findable by Google like Apple news no you're not going
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.920]   to find it Apple music you're not going to find it.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.760]   It's just they love the generic nouns.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.080]   Yeah I wish they would just make up names like they used to.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.240]   You don't like out Capitan and it can be making up names.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.600]   Here's something else missing not completely I mean Apple TV was missing.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.000]   I still think that was an Apple TV in the invitation could be and that they and they
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.220]   turfed it and I think in the terfing of it they also clipped a giant chunk of the home
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.220]   kit stuff out.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.760]   Yes I think that's probably true.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.160]   I expect to see a lot more home kit than we actually.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:33.480]   It was like they announced more stuff last week on home kit with those four packages than
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.080]   they did on the event to yesterday.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.920]   So what what.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.760]   What does it mean wasn't ready to go.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   What do it mean.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.320]   So the Apple TV wasn't.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.780]   I think the deals I think the service was not ready to go and they were not ready to
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.560]   launch the box without the new service to go with it.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.760]   And yet they have said that your existing Apple TV the most recent one will be upgradable
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.720]   so it could be a hub in your home kit right.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.680]   The third generation Apple TV which is looks exactly like the second generation one.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:06.240]   It's the one that can do 1080 and and in not just 720 that one can be a home kit hub.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   Right.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.600]   So any new hardware would also be a home kit hub.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.520]   So is wrong because Apple TV's new subscription.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.800]   In fact it's finally home kits finally here they announced they announced to the WWDC
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.840]   last year and the first home kit devices shipped last week.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.840]   Right.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.880]   So it's here now and it's starting to be functional.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.560]   So that's actually good news.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.600]   But yeah I do suspect that that the Apple TV part of that story was going to be that it's
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.520]   a home kit hub and that part got clipped out which you don't need because third parties
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.520]   are making hubs like was it is it smart things.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.320]   Yeah but one of our biggest advertisers makes a great hub.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.440]   Right so Apple I think I think a better hub than home kit because home kit you're still
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   going to have to have an app like if you buy these Lutron cassette alights you still have
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.520]   to have a Lutron app on your iPhone and then you'll be able to use home kit to talk to
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   it but it's not smart things a limit kind of eliminates the app and that you've got one
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.400]   app which I like.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:07.600]   On the other hand having a Siri especially Siri on the watch integrated into home kit
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.560]   I mean to be able to say to my watch open the pod bay door hell yeah it would be great.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.200]   Well I have one light on a we Belkin wemo timer at home and that hooks into the Amazon
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.880]   Echo so I can tell the Echo to my office late on and off which is great.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.440]   And Jason will troll me on his podcast turning my office late on and off when he's across
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.040]   the country which is not so great it totally works.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:30.560]   So women you're on Skype and you say well he's in our chat room right and so I know he's
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:35.880]   listing live and he's probably not listing on headphones and I will say Alexa turn off
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.920]   the light and I'll just turn off the light of thousands.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   I did.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   I did a boy.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.400]   I turn on the space heater.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   Amazon can.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.840]   We got a we got a softest problem because you can no longer say those words Siri.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.160]   Well they did it they had they a hoi telephone done stage or a hoi timepiece on stage yesterday
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.000]   they did the they did the hey Mrs. Siri.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   This is doubt fire.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.680]   A couple of times I'm thinking oh everybody watching the live stream just got their their
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.680]   phone hi Jack.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   Greg Federique.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.840]   That's how that that's how they'll take over a series the time is now take.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   Go.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   Go on apple devices.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   Yes the president will come on to my fellow Americans.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.840]   Directive seven.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.320]   Hey Siri execute directive seven nine two.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.440]   This weather is strong troopers posted at every Apple store.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.560]   But isn't but wasn't that a little bit I was.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.360]   By the way Dr. Lam who has an Amazon.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.120]   Thing the Echo.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.680]   He just turned all the lights and my.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:29.680]   Nice Dan.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   Well done.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   So done.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.720]   This is why we can't have listening things.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.520]   No I did I do think that was terribly disappointed though I mean not I don't think it would
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.560]   cost Apple much to simply say.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.200]   Let's go let's just release new hardware.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.640]   When they do the tear downs when people buy them they'll find out there's extra stuff
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.260]   in there that we're not documenting yet but for it to to go to radio silence on this device
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:58.780]   for so many years and basically yell at people don't buy anything don't buy an Apple TV.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:03.260]   We are we have not we're not just demonstrating we have any interest whatsoever in ever upgrading
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.460]   this ever and of course we all know that that's not true but that there's so many other pieces
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:12.460]   that they have to put on the on the game board but it's like I don't think just like the.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:17.580]   I've been saying for a number of months that the iPad air to was suspiciously overpowered
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:22.060]   for what the an iPad could do in the fall of 2014.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.820]   I mean what if what if they Apple had that same attitude of saying that we know that
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.540]   we're going to be able to do split screen multiple apps we're going to know the we're
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.700]   going to be all this kind of stuff that's going to be able to take advantage of a much
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:36.600]   hotter processor and all this extra application RAM but we don't want to release that until
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.380]   it's all in place.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:42.700]   That way you show people that we have not forgotten about the nine point seven inch iPad so it's
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.420]   I really think Apple would not have hurt themselves in any way if they simply said at little
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:53.020]   post it post a script to the iPhone six roll up that oh and by the way we're also introducing
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:58.540]   a brand new Apple TV it has the new a six for a six a seven processor.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.700]   We've also has this extra feature and hey just we just want to we just want to bring
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   it up to date and here it is.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:08.420]   Well they desperately need to I mean I really love the Apple TV I have a second generation
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.780]   model but I've switched using a fire TV for most of my day to day stuff just because it's
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.740]   it's not as the Apple TV's gotten along the tooth and when the second generation model
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.580]   they're pulling stuff like YouTube doesn't work on it anymore.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.380]   And they didn't get the most recent.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.380]   Well that's right.
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.380]   Well that's Google's fault they changed the API.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:26.380]   Right yeah but like the point where it's you know it's getting frustrating to use that
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.380]   device it crashes on me a lot it's just very flaky and it doesn't allow.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:35.060]   There's going to be a point right it's still early days on these boxes but I think not
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:40.340]   much longer so there's going to be a point where they better you know get off get going
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.340]   here.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.820]   It sounds like they've had the hardware ready they're waiting for this over the over the
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.820]   top service.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.340]   Well and that would be a big difference because none of these other things do it over the
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.580]   top service in that way.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.220]   So putting that out there without having the services tough though whereas if you can launch
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.700]   it along with the service hey we've got some it comes with this you got a lot of people.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.140]   It is cheap enough people I mean I have three or four of these devices so I never even hooked
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.140]   up the fire TV.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.140]   It's like I don't I don't need a lot of that.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:11.420]   I just put in the new Android shield of the NBA TV that's sweet but it doesn't have any
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.420]   services.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.420]   There's Netflix.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.300]   Well and even the downsides using something like the fire TV is that because all those
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.540]   apps are created by the developers themselves right now they're incredibly inconsistent.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.740]   So you go between apps and the experience.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.380]   Apple has the opportunity to standardize things and present at least a better system
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.460]   especially if they're going to allow third party apps on the Apple TV which I think they
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.180]   doubtlessly will with whatever this new generation is.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.780]   Aaron are you missing a bunch of your missing a bunch of sessions.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   I am a.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   Should you be there?
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.460]   I'll take this time with you and then I'll rush back.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.460]   You're very kind.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.460]   Yes but I am looking forward to an Apple TV app store.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.740]   I mean all the developers love that.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.740]   Absolutely.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:53.700]   And everything that comes out now including the fire TV and Android TV have app stores.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.420]   Everything Roku has an app store and not it was not much of a store you don't have to
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.540]   pay for most of it but it's still there.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.780]   It's weird because every other device I mean they launched the watch with hey you can run
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.820]   apps on it with some caveats admittedly but to have all these very app friendly devices
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.980]   and then have the Apple TV which been around for years and has no app support whatsoever
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:15.940]   other than what Apple occasionally decides to drop mysteriously on you at random times
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.660]   is very it's very strange comparatively.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.980]   The watch let's talk about that.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.700]   Yeah watch watch they decided not to call it.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.700]   Let's recall it.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   iOS it's watch OS.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.700]   Watch OS.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:27.700]   Lowercase W.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.700]   I know space.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.700]   How does that work?
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.700]   Keep that styling.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:34.820]   The official name of the product is uppercase watch the official name of the OS is all lower
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.820]   case.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:36.820]   It's like iOS.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.900]   It's like well I guess it's case sensitive so it can distinguish it's all about name
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.820]   spaces and maybe they'll shift over again.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.620]   They couldn't find the shift key either on the keyboard that's the problem.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:55.700]   Let me ask Aaron I mean is it I mean when the iPhone first came out Steve Jobs said it's
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.180]   OS 10.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.820]   What do what OS does any of this stuff run is there is there is there's a distinction
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.820]   between iOS and OS 10.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.540]   Yeah but under the internal it's all the mock.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:11.620]   So that's what he meant it's the mock yeah the watch isn't running the mock kernel or
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:18.060]   is it I don't know is the watch iOS no I would imagine watch OS watch OS watch OS.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:22.340]   It's probably got a lot of similarities to iOS my guess is but perhaps even stripped
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:27.100]   down further from from what we have in iOS today.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.980]   You know until recently the apps that we could write for the watch really ran on the
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.740]   phone and use the watch as a as a you could even do any animation.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.100]   So we haven't really had a good time to explore the watch.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.100]   It's been a point.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.420]   We're going to write native apps now and we're going to find out what's actually you can
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.420]   actually use those.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:47.620]   I'm really excited that you'll be able to use the microphone and the speaker.
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:53.100]   The haptic response the digital crown plus I'm going to open up a whole lot of ability
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.100]   to sell a lot of it.
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.100]   What's the accelerum?
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.900]   Oh you'll think about the shazam team is must be so psy.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:05.100]   Overall this really does underscore the idea that Apple just did a soft launch of the watch
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:12.260]   in April and the real launch happens in October or September whenever watch 2.0 is released
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:18.140]   and now a whole bunch of features that were just dirt obvious for the one point over release
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.700]   and certainly just weren't ready to be released in time will finally appear not only that
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.060]   but they'll you'll also be able to walk into a store and walk out with a watch that you
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.140]   didn't know that you wanted to buy.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:33.860]   So it's just I'm glad that I'm spending 30 days with the Apple watch and my review hopefully
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.500]   I'll be finishing I'll start writing it this week and hopefully publish it next week but
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.660]   it seemed as though the boon of starting it late and taking 30 days is that it's a total
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:49.260]   it's a lot of the things I was going to complain about if WDC had not taken place are now okay
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.260]   but this now makes sense now that we know that in October you'll be able to see this
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.260]   that in the other.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.740]   The third party complications is a big thing too.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:00.340]   Although the native apps are really nice that's a nice idea to get them to run on the watch
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.780]   if you're if you're away from your phone they could still run because they have the
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.420]   cause if it limits the pause that's always okay.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.980]   Oh that is unused.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:10.980]   Yeah that's the worst feature.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.220]   It's faster to call an Uber on your phone I know it's cool to call an Uber on your watch
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.900]   but if the if the app loads it's great but most of the apps don't don't load and you're
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:22.420]   sitting there and my guest turns on a local app will load a lot faster because yes I'm
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.940]   going to do the communication course of phone right and we don't know but I would guess
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:26.940]   I would guess it would make a little bit.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.020]   But the native complications so the third party apps can put their data on your watch
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.020]   faces.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.860]   We saw the VW logo in there and I guess.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:37.940]   Yeah they mentioned like MLB putting your favorite favorite baseball teams like Starbucks
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:43.820]   putting flight times all that stuff information from apps feeding on to your watch face.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:47.860]   They don't have the I only have the man and I understand who will have the one to watch
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:54.860]   this.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.860]   I have the time I'm using the info face.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:02.860]   The time is tiny and I have six complications and it's still not enough because I want activity.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:03.860]   I've got the moon phase.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:04.860]   I don't know why.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.860]   Well that's going to be one of the I think one of the frontiers of the complications thing
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.860]   is is is using some intelligence to rotate them through like only show the timer when
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:16.860]   you're using the timer or only show your calendar when you've got an event coming up.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.820]   This is what opens the door to complications on something like the iOS lock screen.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.820]   If they're starting to do third party complications for the watch now maybe an iOS 10 we might
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.940]   start to see the ability to do that in the lock screen allow developers to have more
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.860]   specific control over what's on the lock screen.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.860]   On the lock screen.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:33.860]   Yeah on the phone.
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.860]   On the phone.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.580]   Because I don't have a watch screen on your watch.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.340]   No but the idea is if you can write your complications as extensions for your watch then
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.940]   they wouldn't be that far for those developers to use those to display data on the lock screen
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:45.940]   on the phone.
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:46.940]   We're an iPad.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.580]   Yep I love the idea of complications on the screen because one of my complaints about
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:55.780]   Apple watch right now is that almost everything that I want to do on this watch requires me
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.620]   to stop and start fiddling with things.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:01.340]   It doesn't just show me stuff that I'm interested in and if there were something I was very
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:06.380]   very interested in at this moment like a score or like a like a yo alert and just the ability
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.700]   to simply while I'm checking the time to see oh okay I can see that I can see that I've
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.740]   got eight minutes before I have to pull the pull the chicken out of the oven.
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.740]   That's going to make this watch.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.740]   Is that what you call it?
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.420]   No I'm sorry keep going.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.540]   I think that's what they intended.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.660]   I think that's what they intended glances for but it doesn't work because it's not as
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.660]   discoverable right?
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.540]   You're never you flip up for a glance you're never on the right one you don't know where
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.540]   it is.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:35.620]   Yep not just that but I like the fact that the thing one of the primary thing I miss
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:39.820]   about the Android Wear watch that I used to wear is that it would decide that here's
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.940]   the last call that came in and the call already information it's for instance that's probably
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:47.940]   going to be interesting to Andy at some point so even if he doesn't look at it right now
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.260]   that's going to be waiting for him on the screen on the little band at the very bottom
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.620]   of it so that because he is probably going to be checking the time at some point and
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:58.580]   then you're giving him useful information like the like the last ever note like your
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:01.540]   next appointment figuring out what that stuff is going to be.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.940]   So I think that the ways to improve Apple watch for me are going to be give me information
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.500]   that I don't have to do anything to the watch in order to get it's the proactive stuff they
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:13.540]   showed for iOS 9 where it tries to sort of figure out what you're going to do what information
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.940]   you're going to need who you want to talk to it this time of day.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.140]   That always sounds better than it ends up being skeptical.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.740]   You've never seen that really do it.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.540]   Google has tried this with Google now for a while and I think Google now is not bad.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.540]   It's the closest.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.540]   It's not bad it works best.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.540]   It's closest to anything.
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:30.700]   I'm a little skeptical of Apple's ability to do that but it's possible.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:35.980]   I feel that the watch as it stands is really kind of useless and dumb to be honest with
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.380]   you but I was.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.380]   Wow.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.380]   You're looking at your watch.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.140]   Yeah look at the time I got to go leave.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.260]   But I feel like there's some promise now because of watch OS and because of apps that it might
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:52.660]   start to become more useful but as it stands right now come on most people should not buy
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.660]   this.
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.660]   Well I mean it's early.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.700]   It's a one point of product so yeah but I'm really liking it and my wife who expressed
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.700]   a break about it.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.700]   Great skepticism about it.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.140]   Well so I like you know I like the.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.140]   You said your wife heartbeat.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   I like the.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.140]   No one does.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.140]   No one does.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.540]   I like I like I always said other nerds heart beat.
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.380]   I've sent her name Richie my heart.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:15.420]   You know I like the I like looking at some of the data on the complications I like getting
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.660]   my push notifications on my on my wrist I like being able to ignore them when they come
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.900]   to my wrist they don't come on my phone which means my phone doesn't buzz and I can ignore
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.300]   the vibration on my wrist.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.940]   I like all of that talking to my wife about it she seems to have turned most of the way
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   around.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:33.380]   She usually has her phone in her purse and she's a librarian so often it's turned to silent
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.620]   and so you send her text and she can't get them people call her and she doesn't know
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.620]   that they're calling her.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.660]   That's the really good way wearing the watch.
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.700]   She's got a notifier right on her wrist and she can she can get those those texts and
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.220]   know that those calls are coming in.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:46.980]   So there are a bunch of different use cases for it.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:51.180]   But yeah it's a it's a first generation piece of hardware that just came out and is barely
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.180]   been available.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.580]   Kind of dope course it's for nerds right.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:54.580]   Yeah it's kind of dope.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.820]   It's not better.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:01.300]   I think that the difference is that I think that the iPad is probably the most successful
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:05.260]   version 1.0 of anything Apple ever did because it was I thought it was really useful out
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.340]   of the box the iPhone would maybe be second where you knew what the limitations were but
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.300]   what was there was like I'm willing to put up with these limitations because this is
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.820]   clearly the best phone for me right now.
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:21.820]   The watch is third or fourth on that list because I'm formulating what I'm going to
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.780]   be writing as I go I'm taking lots of notes and I think that the lead is going to be that
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.100]   if you're buying it as a watch it's a really cool watch and if you think that's not too
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.100]   much money to spend on a really cool watch go and get it it's going to make you happy
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:38.100]   just like when I just like the watch I bought six years ago this is my mundane Swiss railway
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.540]   watch I like because I wanted when I check the time I want to look at something that's
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:45.500]   this handsome and this and the spiffy so it'll work for you on that basis the question is
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:50.300]   is it going to enhance your daily life in a significant way to the same extent that
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.380]   a new tablet did or the way that a multi touch phone that had those three devices in one
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:58.260]   did right now I don't think that's true but check back at the end of the year check back
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.660]   the end of next year.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   There's potential and that's where I would I would bring you that I think I think I get
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.300]   the impression that they work they knew that they really couldn't revise the hardware that
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:11.940]   much from 1.0 to 2.0 so they wanted to get the hardware absolutely locked down tight and
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.740]   perfect exactly the way they wanted it and they knew that they would have time to develop
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:19.460]   the operating system and develop the onboard apps and develop and help out third party
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.820]   apps and I think that the experience I've had for the past month kind of bears that out
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:26.540]   and I don't think they will rev the hardware anytime soon is my feeling on that matter.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.020]   Oh there won't be a yearly update.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:32.420]   No I think they got themselves into a trap with the iPad and you've seen how that worked
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.860]   out the iPad sales you know they don't know what the refresh cycle is for that and they're
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:40.300]   but they're boxed in because if they don't release a new iPad every year people start
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.820]   doom and gloom and so I think they're going to say hey we don't know what the refresh
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.980]   cycle on the watch is yeah we're going to it's going to be a while before we make another
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   one you make an excellent point because Tim Cook did point that in an analyst call we
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.580]   don't know what the refresh cycle is on the iPad.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:56.980]   This is such a new category we don't know and truthfully somebody spent that $17,000 on
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.900]   it you don't want to tell them.
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.420]   Right and you've even for a few hundred bucks I feel like it's hard to be like this watch
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   still works perfectly well it still tells the time.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.820]   I think it's funny that Andy mentioned that the approach of getting the hardware right
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.340]   and then fixing the software that's actually exactly what Pebble did with the original
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:16.260]   Pebble they shipped an amazing piece of hardware and the software just was kind of you know
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.860]   watch this space at the beginning and then they kept iterating over the over the two
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:25.140]   years that you know that I was using it they brought it a long way and I do think that
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:29.060]   that's not the worst approach with a new product like this because you can't update the hardware
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.660]   on the fly but you can you can keep updating the software.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.420]   I would throw the echo in that category as well.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.180]   I think it's a nice piece of hardware and the software just keeps getting better.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.180]   It does doesn't it.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.900]   Amazon is really they're aggressively rolling out new stuff.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.900]   Oh should that constantly.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:48.780]   In fact we talked so much about Siri Cortana and Google now it turns out the some of the
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:52.900]   best voice recognition is coming from a company called Amazon who would have thought that.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.300]   Who would have said that right that's the least likely source.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:03.140]   What else anything else about the watch that we want to mention before we move on.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.700]   I think it's a bit I love the rollback time feature.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.700]   Oh that's right.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.740]   Time travel travel travel travel.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.980]   If you scroll enough far enough forward by the way you can see your own death.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:15.980]   You are dead.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.980]   You have no arms.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   Yes.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:21.580]   Does it warn you not to bother renewing your Apple care?
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.380]   Don't worry about this.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.380]   You're too much.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.380]   That is an example though.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.940]   That's a really good example of something that is you can't do on a regular wristwatch
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.140]   that is unique to the Apple watch Android where it doesn't have it because it doesn't have
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.780]   a stem.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.340]   There's an example of something that Apple might have found some secret sauce.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.740]   I'm looking for the secret sauce.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.500]   That may be the first thing I've seen.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.500]   Well it's funny because it was there that feature was there in the astronomy face and
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.500]   the solar face.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.500]   That's right.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.500]   And not in the other faces.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.100]   And it sounds like yeah they had this conversation of instead of doing a list view like Pebble
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.980]   Time what if we took that and applied it to all the other data that we're doing to not
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.060]   just this astronomical data that's in this one watch face.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.060]   And so that's what they did.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.940]   You roll time forward to see what's coming up.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.340]   Roll time backward to see what you missed.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.340]   That's pretty cool.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.700]   I should be clear by the way that I don't just think the Apple watches Dopey.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:13.420]   I think smart watches generally are Dopey at this point.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.060]   But have there's some potential there.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.060]   You got to start somewhere.
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.060]   You got to start somewhere.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.060]   I agree.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.060]   And I'm just a dope-proving bought it.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.060]   That's all.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.060]   I don't see you wearing one.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.140]   So I hate to be the grout shield man but I like to be that easy to reach.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.140]   That easy to do.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.140]   Exactly my point.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:32.220]   But I recognize that once I go to the 6+ phone and I carry around on my back because it's
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:36.140]   so huge that having a wrist device is going to make sense.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.980]   As the phones get bigger and bigger I'm going to have to have something convenient.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:46.180]   I find that because the watch is so tiny and finicky and difficult and so long to launch
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.420]   apps I still pull out the phone just the time.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.980]   Yeah the number of times I was traveling recently in Europe and I would like to try
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.460]   to load up an app and it would start spinning and I'd be like oh for heaven's sake.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.460]   And you take out the phone.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.180]   But again native apps may solve this.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.500]   There's an argument to be made that they should have shipped without apps at all.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.500]   But you know.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.500]   But then the phone does nothing.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.260]   Except tell you the time and the moon phase.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.700]   This is another bit of thinking that I was doing.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.420]   So I'm at the stage where I'm trying.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.940]   Okay here are my reactions and let me try to make sense of these reactions and see if
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.300]   they're valid or not.
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:20.060]   And something that was an interesting thought I had was that if Apple simply sold this as
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.300]   here is a cool look and watch and it has a whole bunch of really cool fitness features
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.140]   and it will allow notifications from iOS onto this device.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:33.020]   And now that the deal breaker is and we're also selling it for $250 and not $400 and
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.780]   not $10,000.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.060]   I would be saying this is a really really cool product.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:44.340]   It's when you try to add the extra functionality and that it's really falling short and I'm
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.780]   having the exact same experience with Dan.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.900]   That's the most disappointing part of it.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.780]   The number of times you're like okay when's the next bus?
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:58.060]   Well I have this glimpse from this other app which I can also get on my phone and you just
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   take that out.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.260]   It's the number of times I give up on getting something off the watch and use it on the
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.260]   phone instead.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.140]   The temperature in some conference room in Cupertino dips down two degrees every time
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.140]   that happens.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.940]   It's about -300 right now.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:18.180]   For me my ideal watch interaction actually outside of push notifications which I do like
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:23.420]   is the Major League Baseball Glance which is reliable and I basically flip it down and
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.420]   check the score.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   That works great.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.420]   But you go to an app and then you can - How many glances though?
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   I'm down to like four.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.420]   Yeah me too.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.420]   It's unusable.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   Don't over glance.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   Don't over glance.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.420]   Well because if you get 12 over notify either.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.420]   I agree.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   Strip down the phone's capabilities.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.420]   Keep it as - keep the watch as you've gone.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   You got it doesn't glance as you open up and you're like where am I?
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.780]   Where is the one I want?
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.780]   Is it right?
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.780]   Is it left?
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.780]   You know I think it's kind of a nightmare.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.180]   Did everybody stand up at 10 to the hour?
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   No.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.180]   I'm surprised.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.300]   We all look to each other like should we stand?
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.900]   I think they missed a real opportunity because you know that everybody in the rooms watch
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.940]   went off including the people on stage.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.500]   They should have all just said okay time for a break.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   Everybody go like this.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.500]   We're like this.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.700]   Both those are lazy right.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.780]   You've been very good not talking about music.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:15.700]   By the way Aaron can I thank you because this bike code, intermediate bike code thing that
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:21.580]   is a huge scoop that I don't think anybody's reported on that I think has really significant
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.580]   meaning.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.580]   Right.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.580]   There's something going on there.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.980]   Apple wouldn't require that and the fact they're requiring it now is in is I think telling
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   is interesting.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.740]   Power piece coming back.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:32.740]   We buried the lead.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.740]   We buried the lead.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:39.340]   That is maybe the most significant thing I've heard from the entire WWDC.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.020]   That is a weird and interesting change.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:48.500]   We also forget that even when Apple was first talking about OS 10, the pre developer beta
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.660]   release, they're also saying that one of the features of this is going to be it's going
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:57.180]   to be CPU independent that we can basically burn a version of this for any CPU we want.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.300]   That's part of the fundamental reasons why we're doing this.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:04.100]   Steve Jobs had Avi Tovanian and the rest of the crew at Next doing multi platform versions
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.340]   of Next Step and Open Step.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.140]   Next Step was multi platform in the mid 90s.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.140]   We were on the Spark chip.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.860]   And was parallel on all of those platforms.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.180]   It wasn't like, okay, you're done now.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.420]   We just leave that alone.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.420]   They continued to develop it.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.460]   That was one of the things Apple gained with OS 10.
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.180]   And remember the huge surprise when they went and showed it running on Intel.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.180]   And everyone was like, what?
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:30.420]   They never want to be caught flat footed again and feel like, oh no, we're falling behind
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.860]   and we're tied to this hardware.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   They want to be agile.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:33.860]   I've to be shut down.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.860]   I watched it for two years.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.940]   There's motion at my front door.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.940]   Shut up.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940]   Okay.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:44.380]   That, by the way, that is a great feature of Ring.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.380]   And I can now look.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.820]   It was one of our new sponsors.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.940]   I can now actually look at my front door and just see what's going on there.
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.580]   There's a squirrel at your front door.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.580]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.860]   I turned up the sensitivity a little too much.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.620]   So now how long until employers start buying their employees?
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.420]   The watch is my question.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   Why?
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   Why would they buy employees?
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.540]   The one track productivity track all sorts of things.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.420]   I mean, you'd be able to message your employees.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:06.420]   Your heart rate is enough.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.420]   I know.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.420]   Oh, Lord.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.820]   It's enough about the work that you're doing.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:12.980]   You probably could turn it into one of those home arrest bands.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:15.620]   Just put it around an ankle.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.620]   You know, they're not so different technology.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.460]   They're not so different.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.820]   Our show today, all right.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.820]   You guys have been very good.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   Dan Morrin is here.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.220]   Podcaster six colors dot com.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.180]   Still writes for Macworld dot com.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.180]   Nice to have you.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.180]   Great to have you on the show.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:33.220]   Of course, Jason Snell, who we love and sidle up to as often as possible.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.820]   He's at six colors dot com and the incomparable.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.320]   Oh, yes.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320]   And many other places.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.460]   And by the way, I was behind the scenes.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.460]   I'm going, I'm looking.
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.780]   Look, you got a great sponsor on six color.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   I think you're doing well.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780]   Thank you.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.820]   I feel like you kind of maybe you turned the corner there.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.020]   Yeah, we're having a good time.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020]   You're doing all right.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.380]   Dan's working with me a couple days a week.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.860]   And we're writing a lot of stuff.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.940]   And I think that's--
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.860]   I'm really thrilled to turn.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.620]   We have no corporate overlords.
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.620]   I am the corporate.
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.980]   You're selling?
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.020]   And by the way, nicely done, subtle ads.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.260]   These are not annoying.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.220]   Yeah, well, I mean, I'm following John Gruber's lead there.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.220]   Gruber does a good job with that.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.120]   And then a single ad from the deck.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   And that's it.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.520]   I don't want to plaster my pages with junk.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.240]   Every now and then people say, are you
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.280]   going to add share buttons like Facebook share button?
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.120]   I'm like, no.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:18.720]   Good for you.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.120]   You can share it from your browser.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.000]   You don't need my buttons to do that.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.640]   And I would rather they not be there.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.520]   And he's using a nice programmer font for the timestamps.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520]   I love mono space font.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.320]   Very important.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   Very important.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   Is that in Consolata?
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:32.920]   What is that?
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.420]   I like it.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.120]   I'm not sure what that is.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   It's probably a CSS.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   So it probably could be great.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   For your programmer font.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   Menlo.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:38.620]   Menlo.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.120]   Menlo.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.620]   Yeah, I think I write in Menlo too.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.920]   It's a sweet font.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.020]   I actually talk about nerd.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.820]   I have a folder on my drop box with programming
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.220]   with fixed width fonts.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.220]   Droid Sans.
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:50.820]   There's one called Sheldon.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.120]   Menlo in Consolata.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.220]   It's a lot of favorite.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.220]   Consolata in Consolata in Consolata in Consolata in Consolata.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.220]   It's original, right?
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.420]   In Consolata is the--
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.120]   Menlo is good.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.020]   I didn't-- I actually eschewed the stuff
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:06.620]   that Apple ships because of Monaco, frankly.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.420]   Monaco is a classic, but it's old.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   Two words.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.420]   Two words.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   What?
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420]   Courier Prime.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   Courier Prime?
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:14.420]   I don't know that one.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.420]   Mono Space Fonts talk has broken out.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.420]   I'm a good lord.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.420]   What are we doing?
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.220]   Oh, forget this Apple Music thing.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.220]   Let's talk about Monosheps.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.220]   Courier Prime.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.820]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.020]   So in retune, like, this basic Courier font
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:31.020]   to make it prettier and a little bit thicker
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.420]   and just greater for, like, blocks and blocks of tech.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.220]   I use Courier whenever I fill out PDFs
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.020]   to trick people into thinking I typed it on a typewriter.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.820]   I think somebody should do a Selectric Ball set,
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.620]   like all the different Selectric Ball fonts.
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.020]   That would be nice to have.
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.820]   Aaron Hillagast is here from Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.220]   If you want to learn about Swift, get his new book,
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.020]   Coco Programming for Mac OS X, the fifth edition is out,
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.420]   and for the first time, it's in Swift.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.420]   Yes, I'm going to get it.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   I'm going to get it because I like Swift.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.320]   Everything I've read about Swift, I feel like
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.820]   it's a modern language.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:02.820]   It's very elegant.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.520]   It's pretty to look at.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.620]   I'm going more in the functional direction, though.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.320]   You know, I've been teaching myself Lisp.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.020]   Yes, there's a lot of nice functional things built in.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.020]   Closures and things.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.720]   It's really interesting because there were these two forks.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.120]   There was C and there was Lisp.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.520]   And C became dominant.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.320]   Everybody's doing this in these imperative languages
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.720]   and suddenly they're saying, you know,
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.520]   this functional Lisp stuff wasn't such a bad idea.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.420]   Right.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.320]   And it's coming back in.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.620]   Now it's a nice, it's a nice melding of the two.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.920]   I like it.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.120]   You can also take classes and it's really,
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.820]   he may say ranch, it's a monastery.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.620]   It's a place to go where you chant.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.620]   Oh, you're going to wear people.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.020]   No, no, it's great.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.720]   It's in Atlanta and it's also in a syllamar,
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.820]   which is a state park near Monterey.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.620]   I didn't know you did this.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620]   We do it at a syllamar.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.520]   So it's the most beautiful place in the world.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.520]   And then we can do corporate training.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.120]   We can send someone to your company and teach everybody.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.020]   Alex Lindsay's done it.
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:54.720]   He loved it.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.420]   He had so much fun.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.720]   He did the iOS stuff.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.520]   That's exactly.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.820]   The one week I was class.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.620]   Someday I dream of taking a week off.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.220]   I have, by the way, all these books.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.020]   I'm like, that could be my bookshelf.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.020]   But I get to get the new one.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.020]   Thank you for being here, Anne.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:13.820]   And of course, Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun Times who lists,
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.020]   but for another reason entirely.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.420]   No, I'm just, I'm just teasing.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.420]   He's a big e-mail.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.220]   We all know you're teasing.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.820]   I'm teasing because I love.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.320]   I tease because I love.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.420]   Talking to the Apple Store tonight.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:31.020]   Oh, if you're in San Francisco for a WWDC,
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.920]   head on over to the Apple Store, the big one, right?
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.420]   Downtown.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.120]   That's right.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:41.120]   You'll be there at 6.30 PM, Apple Store San Francisco.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.620]   That's kind of like Nirvana, Apple Store San Francisco.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.920]   So two years ago when I did it, I spoke.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.820]   And they told me it was the biggest event they had ever had.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:49.320]   Wow.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.720]   And then a half hour later, Boys to Men came in.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.520]   And that became the biggest event they'd ever had.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.920]   So I tell people now that I open for Boys to Men.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.220]   Boys to Men, always ruining things for other people.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.920]   I did you, did you, did you, did you meet them and say,
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.320]   follow that chump.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.720]   Just drop the mic, you know.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.920]   Or did you say, am I the boys in this scenario?
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.320]   Who's the man who's the boy here?
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:11.920]   What happened there?
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   Are you sure today brought to you by ITProTV?
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.620]   We're talking about learning here.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.420]   And if you're in the IT business or you'd like to be in the IT
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.220]   business, you know those certifications are very important
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.520]   to getting a job.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.920]   But even if you're not trying to get a cert, you're trying to learn
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.620]   and get better at this, this is the place to go.
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:33.720]   A TV network dedicated exclusively to the world of information
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.620]   technology.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.620]   It's a nerd dream come true.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:42.420]   Hundreds of hours of content, two studios, 50 hours of live
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.020]   programming every week.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:48.020]   And of course, a list that just grows all the time,
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.420]   everything from A plus and Net Plus and security plus to CCNA,
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.120]   network security.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.620]   They've just put up now the ethical hacker cert course
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.220]   that Sean Philip Oriano taught.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.620]   We told you all about that.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.620]   Hacking forensics investigator.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.620]   You want a job?
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.220]   That's a job.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.820]   I guarantee you, you go to any police department in the nation
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.220]   and say, I am a forensics expert.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.620]   You will get a job.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.420]   Cryptography courses too.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   That's just fun for your brain.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   He, Sean, is a really amazing guy.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.920]   He's worked with the business, but also with the military
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.220]   on this stuff and actually wrote the book on ethical hacking.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.820]   You can search for anything you're looking for and their new
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.020]   search will let you find specific topics, quick answers.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.920]   You see, this is the, this is what's going on live.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.220]   And this is so cool that you're watching.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.920]   I mean, I cannot describe how cool this is.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.520]   You don't have to have a Windows server to take these
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.020]   courses.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:46.120]   They have a Windows virtual server and virtual clients.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.420]   You can run in any HTML5 browser so you can learn all
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.820]   the, all the Microsoft stuff.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.420]   The measure of practice exams are free with your subscription.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.120]   That's where it's 79 bucks.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.720]   You get interaction with the host state.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.120]   Just like us, they have chat during the live shows and web based
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.720]   Q&A specific to study topics.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.820]   It's like a study group for you.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.020]   Even if you're enrolled in a course or you're buying the books
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.820]   or whatever, this is the best way to learn.
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.620]   I think it's a great adjunct to anything else you're doing.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.420]   And boy, the price is right.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.020]   You pay per month or per year when you buy a year, by the way,
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.020]   you can download the courses and put them on your device
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.620]   and watch on the plane or whatever.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.420]   They do have corporate and group pricing if you're interested.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:28.520]   And in fact, their clients include Harvard, MIT, UCSD,
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.820]   and Stanford for the top computer companies in, you know,
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.720]   colleges in the world.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:40.520]   It pro dot TV slash Mac break, normally $57 a month, $570
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:40.920]   for the year.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.620]   We're going to give you 30% off.

[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.420]   live anytime.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.620]   So take advantage of that too.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:57.520]   Go to itpro.tv/macbreak and use the offer code Mac break 30
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.420]   to save 30% on the first month or year, but forever,
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.220]   making it really a good deal.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.720]   That's less than $40 a month.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.520]   By the way, right now live until 4 o'clock Eastern
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.820]   this afternoon, they're just about to wrap up for the day.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.720]   But Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern,
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.120]   they're doing courses on PF sense firewall and updated
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   network plus content.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.120]   That's Don Pazette.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:22.920]   We'll be doing that.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.820]   That's not who you're seeing right now, though, but Don Pazette
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.420]   will be doing that.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.220]   IT pro does that for free with the basic membership and that
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.520]   you can't beat either.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.720]   These guys are great.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.420]   Itpro.tv/macbreak, use the offer code Mac break 30 to save
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:40.020]   30% off of the life of your account.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.620]   All right, time to talk music.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.920]   A challenging world.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.620]   Let me set the stage here because Apple is the number one
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.920]   retailer of music, iTunes and digital downloads at iTunes
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.420]   dominate the industry entirely.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.920]   But the world is changing.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.820]   People have been moving 100 million people listen to Pandora,
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.120]   60 million people listen to Spotify.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.720]   And you're seeing dramatic almost precipitous drops in
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.320]   record sales over the last few years.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.320]   Apple obviously recognizes they've got to do something.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.520]   They buy beats with beats streaming service, which
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.020]   on its own was not wildly successful around 110,000
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.820]   subscribers when they bought it.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.020]   Compare that to 100 million or 60 million.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.920]   You get an idea that beats was a late to the party and
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.720]   perhaps not the strongest.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.260]   But I think they also felt good about getting Dr.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.120]   Dre getting Jimmy Iveen and maybe even more importantly
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.620]   getting Trent Reznor and designing something that they
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.220]   could.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.420]   Is it replace?
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.620]   You feel like it's replace iTunes and purchases with that
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.820]   this is I feel like people don't buy music.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.020]   I think they're live some people do and some people don't.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.520]   So they're what people want to own music.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.720]   Well, some people do and some people don't.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.120]   And I think what Apple is trying to do is have it both ways.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.920]   You can buy music from them.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.820]   You can stream all your music.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.620]   It also integrates essentially the features of iTunes
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:00.920]   match.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.620]   So if you've music that's not on their service, it'll get
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.120]   added and then you'll have access to it too.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.720]   That I wasn't they didn't weren't clear at the presentation,
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.020]   but they do say that on the web page.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.020]   Right.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.820]   That that that is interesting.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.320]   That is what Google does now with its all access music and
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.920]   Amazon does with its music.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.020]   It allows you to upload and iTunes match does sure, but now
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.820]   they allow you to upload and stream via their new music
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:24.320]   service.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.420]   So that way if that's a competitive event Taylor Swift
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.820]   weren't on this service and maybe she will be but she's not
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.720]   on the others you and you buy her album.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.820]   It would just be integrated with every all the other music
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.120]   I use the Beatles as an example.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.120]   So the only way you're going to get Beatles and a streaming
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.920]   music service right is that you you bought them on CD or
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.620]   on iTunes and they will just show up.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.620]   But otherwise I think beats music is a is a good service.
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:47.720]   I love how they spent time talking about the thing I liked
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.920]   from their music presentation as they talked about curation.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.920]   They talked about using human beings to pick playlists and
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.620]   it's people who understand music who are trying to go beyond
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.720]   the algorithm and beats as a music service was really good
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.320]   is until the end of the month.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.920]   A really that was its thing that was its thing.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.920]   That's what Jimmy I have been step forward before when they
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.420]   founded beats and said we believe we want to bring the
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:08.920]   human back in the music.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.420]   So it's I think it's a good service.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.520]   It was late to the party and hasn't really caught on.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.420]   But I think Apple is also hobbled by its association with AT&T.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:17.920]   I think I think it's a smart move.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.420]   It was a smart move for Apple to take it.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.020]   I think rebranding it is just fine.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.920]   But I think that they're there.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.520]   They're some of the busy features like the sentences.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.820]   Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm hanging with my keynote buddies way
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.420]   that was the unique thing.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.120]   They're also taking away the beats Android app and they
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.520]   won't have Android till the fall.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.720]   Right.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.320]   You know, that's a big audience.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.420]   It's like not having a Windows app.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.620]   They will have a Windows app in the fall as well.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.520]   Well, they take it away or will they just leave it there?
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.120]   We don't know.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.520]   Yeah, maybe they'll leave it there.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.920]   I have to feel I have to be compatible service.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.220]   When this launches in 8.4 at the end of the month, June 30th,
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.520]   I have to feel like the old beats is going to just say, OK,
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.320]   switch over.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:58.820]   Bye.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.420]   It could be.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.320]   And for Android users, that's going to be OK.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.020]   Bye bye.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.920]   Yeah, well, that's what they're doing then.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.220]   Well, and for the Android the Android app is also
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:09.220]   hobbled in that there's no free access.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.920]   If you are-- you can only get the-- so there's a number of
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.120]   features that if you're using it on iOS or on your Mac,
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:14.820]   you can get for free.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.320]   You can listen to Beats 1.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.220]   You can get some of the streaming radio stations
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.820]   with limited skips.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.820]   But that's not available as a tier for Android.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:25.220]   You have to be a paid subscriber to get anything.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.520]   It surprised me that Beats 1 was free because that was
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.420]   another differentiator is we're going to have a 24/7 global
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.920]   radio station with three of the best known disc jockeys in
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.520]   the world who I had never heard of.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.320]   And that was a differentiator.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.720]   But you get every Apple user gets that.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   Well, that's a great way to sell music and to get people
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.720]   into the service.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.020]   That's a great way to say, look, we're giving away all this
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.020]   music for free.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.420]   We've got people who are choosing it.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.320]   We really want to appeal.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.720]   I get it both because I'll subscribe to Spotify for the
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.320]   same price, 10 bucks a month.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.820]   And I get Beats 1 radio.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.820]   But the family price is amazing, right?
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.520]   I mean, 15 bucks.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.920]   15 bucks a month.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.520]   That's what's willing to use iCloud family sharing.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.920]   I had some people have had.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.920]   Oh, you have to use family sharing to do that.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.720]   It's time to get that.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   Do your family share.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.720]   I had heard that the Verge said that Spotify was going to
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.220]   respond to that with a similar price.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:17.220]   I don't see an announcement.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:17.920]   I don't think they've done that.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.920]   That happens when you've got deals with labels, right?
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.520]   Is that you come back to them and say, cut us that same
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.920]   deal for family.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.820]   And the tip for tap, by the way, was they know free tier.
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.520]   I mean, that's what the labels didn't like.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.020]   That's what Taylor Swift didn't like.
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:33.420]   Because the free tier of Spotify and Pandora and all these
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.420]   others.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.420]   Well, that's very Apple.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.420]   Right.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.420]   That's very Apple to just say, look, pay us.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.220]   That's what we're here for as you pay us money.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.420]   There will be some free stuff.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   You said radio one is free.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.420]   Beats one is free.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.420]   Some stuff.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.620]   iTunes radio is not going away.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.220]   There are still going to be curated stations and you will be
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.820]   able to listen to them for free with limited skips much as
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.220]   you can now on iTunes radio.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.420]   So they do have a free tier.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.620]   There is some free stuff, but it's less control, right?
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.220]   You can't just go and play any song.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.620]   I think Pandora is like that.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:00.620]   Closer to Pandora than Spotify.
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:03.620]   I found that really confusing.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:08.220]   I mean, I was expecting to see one just sort of tight ball of
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.820]   music features, but now I'm thinking, okay, so I've got the radio
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.420]   station plus I've got iTunes match plus I've got Apple radio plus
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.820]   I've got curated playlist from other people plus I've got a social
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.020]   media platform.
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:24.620]   I mean, it's just it really just seems like I if I understand
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.620]   what Apple's going for, I really think that they don't want to leave
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.620]   anything behind on the plate.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.260]   They want to if there is a way that somebody is experiencing
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:33.820]   music, they want to have a product that will that will work with
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.340]   whatever you're going to do because they don't want people to leave
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.380]   the Apple ecosystem in order to get internet radio or they don't
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.780]   want to they like everything except for a curated playlist.
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.340]   They're going to still be dipping into Spotify for curated
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.420]   playlists, but it made it really, really difficult to follow the
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.740]   story that they're trying to tell yesterday.
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:54.660]   And it's really to all that I was hearing was, okay, we've got that
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.980]   feature from Star Spotify.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.740]   Now we've got this feature from this other service you're
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.740]   familiar with.
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.740]   I don't know what to think.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.100]   There's it just seems like the note that I was the note that I
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:07.060]   have in front of me taken at the time was that, okay, you've
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:10.380]   given me a lot of reasons why this new music system is great for
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.380]   Apple.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   I don't think you've given me a reason why it's going to be
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:13.900]   great for me, the customer.
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.780]   I think the service could be good, although getting all that
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.460]   stuff in a single lab is going to be really hard.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.700]   I think there's no questions.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.580]   Anybody seen the app?
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.580]   They showed the music app on iOS.
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   Yeah, not sure.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.580]   So I will you integrate an iTunes on Mac.
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:31.340]   Which is already kind of a I gave me great hope.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.740]   My heart started pounding a little bit when they showed what
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.940]   looked like a very different iTunes on the screen and then
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.940]   they say anything more.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:39.260]   But do you think they've rewritten iTunes?
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.420]   I sure hope so.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:40.940]   I hope so.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.700]   But this newest version isn't even that old.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.740]   So it's unclear whether they're ready to throw that all out
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:45.260]   already.
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.580]   I think iTunes is gradually becoming an operating system.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.420]   And sentient.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:50.420]   It's the E-Max.
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.580]   It's the E-Max music player.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.060]   You'll be able to get mail from it.
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.140]   But absolutely right.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.820]   They didn't they didn't make the case.
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:58.100]   And that's one of my great faults with that section of the
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.620]   keynote is not only is it long and boring and overstuffed and
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.820]   self-indulgent and very not Apple keynote, but they have a
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.060]   very interesting complicated service that they need to make
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:08.660]   the case for.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.540]   And instead that was sort of like here's Drake.
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.700]   He'll tell you some stories and didn't they didn't make the
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.980]   case that they needed to make.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.940]   Story time with Drake.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.660]   I don't want to blame Drake.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.780]   I thought he was very well-spoken.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.780]   I liked how natural he was.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:22.980]   He's very good on stage.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.220]   But he didn't have what he was doing made no sense.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:28.020]   His lead in was for something that he didn't talk about.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.220]   And he was in the middle of kind of a disaster of a
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:31.940]   presentation.
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:35.460]   Yeah, I thought he had dignity and told an interesting story,
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.500]   but it wasn't what out.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.860]   It didn't serve Apple's needs.
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.220]   And they didn't set him up properly.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.740]   So it made him look like he was off the reservation a little
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.900]   bit, which is bad for him.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.180]   So yeah, it was a mess.
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.020]   And it's a shame because this is Andy's right.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.140]   This is a complicated service.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:51.620]   They really need to explain how iTunes and this service and
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:54.020]   the streaming and the radio all work together.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:55.860]   And they didn't.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.820]   And everybody came out going, I don't understand what this
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:58.500]   product is.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.620]   And that's a failure.
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.820]   To set the stage Drake.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.820]   To set the-- who, by the way, we all want to--
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:03.820]   Love the jacket.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.180]   Yeah, we all want his rainbow Apple.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.500]   No, he's really likable.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.500]   Yeah, he was.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.100]   It was not his fault that he was in the middle of--
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.780]   Just was off message, I guess.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.980]   Yeah, and that--
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:14.940]   But you know, when you--
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:14.940]   But when you--
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.140]   --it's like, you're the one that's hammer Apple would--
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.740]   Yeah, you put musicians on stage.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.020]   They're not going to be on message.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:20.740]   I got bad news.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.740]   Even Jimi, Jimmy Iveen was not really on message.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.980]   He was on something.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.500]   He was on something.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.220]   He keeps saying what an asset Jimmy Iveen is.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.100]   I don't feel--
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:32.300]   Maybe not front-facing front stage.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.140]   Probably not on stage.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:33.940]   --behind the scenes.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.620]   Yeah, I don't think he's in the next phase here, though.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.220]   I want to take a poll of you guys.
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.980]   How do you listen to music?
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.620]   What service do you use to?
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.140]   I mainly listen to stuff that I own in iTunes.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.900]   I've started using the three Spotify tier a little bit more
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.780]   for things that I'm just like, yeah, I'm not sure if I want
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:50.540]   to buy this, but I want to audition it first.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:53.020]   But most of the stuff I listen to is stuff I've owned.
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.220]   Ripped from CDs or bought from iTunes.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.260]   How about you, Jason?
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.940]   I bought a year of beats, and I listen to it occasionally.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.380]   But most of what I listen to is still stuff I bought
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:05.660]   or bought on iTunes or Amazon or Ripped from CD.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.340]   You know what I bought?
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.300]   The little Apple USB Apple that the Beatles released
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:14.500]   with 24-bit remixes, the 2009 Masters.
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.740]   I listen to that a lot in my head.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.020]   Aaron, how do you listen to music?
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.380]   So programmers need music.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:21.620]   You've got to--
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.860]   It depends on the setting, right?
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.060]   So in the house, Spotify, we're a Spotify family
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.180]   and it's streaming over the speakers in the house.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.260]   But in my car, I have a CD player that has MP3 player.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.580]   MP3 decoder and it's--
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:33.780]   CD's.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.180]   Sullburn's CDs, which for me is on them.
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:36.900]   Wow.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.220]   And I get those from Amazon.
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.940]   So yeah, I'm going back to the CD player in my car,
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.540]   which I've had for like three years now.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:47.020]   Yeah, I've had the same CD in it for the entire three years.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:47.860]   I can't get it out of here.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.060]   I have a mix.
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:49.540]   No, I can't do that.
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.820]   When I got the stereo, I had a mixed CD
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.180]   that I had made in like 2001.
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.620]   And I was like, oh, well, I'll stick this in there.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.260]   And that's it.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.980]   Steve Martin sent me his new Bluegrass CD three years ago.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.940]   I said, wow, a CD.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:00.420]   I put it in.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.220]   I haven't taken it out.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:01.620]   I like it, though.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.060]   Everyone's a while.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:02.620]   Listen to it.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.300]   Nice to have.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.740]   Andy, how do you listen?
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:06.700]   I'm like Jason.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.620]   I'm like Dan.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.060]   I tend to buy music.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.420]   The gold standard is that if I buy it on CD,
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.740]   it means I love this so much.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.460]   I want to own it in uncompressed, unlocked format
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.460]   so I can remaster it in years to come.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:21.540]   But for discovery, I do have a Google music.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:24.580]   Google music account, which I pay for because I got it
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.820]   got in at eight bucks a month.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.980]   Yeah, but oddly.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.060]   And so I use that for a lot of sampling and discovery
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.300]   and for just magical sinking of my music library everywhere.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.220]   But the weirdest thing is that when I want it,
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.420]   when I hear about an album or band or anything,
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.380]   the first place I go is YouTube because it's either
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.900]   there's an official video or someone has taken the album
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.900]   and posted it illegally to YouTube.
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.300]   And I will use that as my sampling corridor.
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.540]   And then if I decide that, OK, that really is cool album.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.700]   Then I'll go back to Amazon or wherever and buy the full album.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.620]   I think we're just old fogies buying our music.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.620]   Yeah, it sounds like.
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:03.780]   I just don't like the idea of I love curating my own playlists.
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.660]   And I don't like the idea of if I ever
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.020]   stop paying for Spotify, this playlist
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.860]   that I've spent like three or four or five years now just
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:15.180]   sort of curating and new songs come in and old ones
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:17.140]   that I thought I liked, I don't like so much.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.980]   I just want to have control of all
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.180]   of those files and know that no matter what happens,
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:24.700]   if this company goes away, if they get bought by a company
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.020]   I don't approve of, or if I simply decide that, look,
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:30.180]   I'm now spending $43 a month on various subscription music
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:31.740]   services, I need to cut one of these.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:34.260]   I want to be able to have, I want the truth, so to speak,
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.780]   of my music library to live on my own computer.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.540]   Well, well, here's the more telling question for those of you,
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.260]   I don't have kids, but for those of you who do,
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.380]   how do they listen to music?
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.380]   YouTube.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:46.100]   Yeah, YouTube seems to be one of the most spot on Spotify, Pandora.
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.140]   There's a line wire for a long time.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.140]   Their generation, in fact, Lime wire got to be such a problem
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.260]   when they were in their early teens
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.020]   that I used iTunes to give them allowances,
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.460]   like a $10 or $20 a month allowance, one or two CDs a month,
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:05.540]   trying to convince them there'd be better to buy music.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.460]   And they did do that.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.460]   But now, I think Spotify, but mostly,
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.300]   if they're hanging out in the house,
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.500]   they'll start a YouTube thread up,
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   and it might be on the TV and they have it going in the background.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.460]   That just seems to be how kids today,
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.980]   like it's like MTV was for us, maybe.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.180]   Do you have kids?
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.180]   I have two kids, two boys.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:29.180]   I'll hold them.
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:30.180]   14 and 10.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.180]   Perfect.
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:33.700]   And the 14-year-old downloads them from the iTunes store,
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.580]   and he buys them once again with typically gifts or TV.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:37.780]   Do you encourage him to buy?
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.980]   Like, let's support the artists,
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.980]   because that's what I was trying to give the message to the kids,
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.980]   was support your artists.
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:46.980]   I do believe that, but I've never introduced them to BitTorrent,
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.980]   so.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.980]   And they find it.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.980]   But I got back into music because of Napster.
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.980]   I was suddenly, you know, I went through a bad spell,
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.980]   because I was a DJ.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.980]   No one hates music more than people have to play music
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.980]   every single day all day.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.980]   That was my job, didn't want to listen to music when I got home.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.980]   But when Napster came out and I was no longer a DJ,
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.980]   I rediscovered my love for music,
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.980]   and the variety of music was out there,
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:12.980]   downloaded 10,000 songs easily from Napster.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:13.980]   But I-
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.980]   So you won't be DJing Beats One, though,
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:15.980]   is what you're saying.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.980]   No, I won't.
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:20.980]   You know, anyway, don't get me started on radio.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   But now it's Spotify for me, Pandora for a long time.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:27.980]   I still pay for a pro account in both of those,
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:29.980]   for, you know, paid account.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.980]   I also have Google Music because it's $8 like Andy,
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.980]   and I really like the fact that both Google and Amazon
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.980]   let me upload my collections.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.980]   Again, I want those Beatles to be available, you know, my stories.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.980]   I love the automatic workflow.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   I buy all my music from Amazon,
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.980]   not necessarily because they're the best store,
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.980]   but because if I buy it from Amazon,
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:49.980]   without doing anything,
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   first a copy goes into my Amazon locker,
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.980]   so it's available there,
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.980]   then it gets automatically by help-erapped,
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.980]   downloaded into my iTunes library,
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   and then the Google Music plugin sees it in my iTunes library
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.980]   and uploads it to Google Music.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:04.980]   So it's like, no matter where I am,
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   if I'm within spitting distance of two chips and an LED,
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:12.980]   I can get access to my entire music library.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:13.980]   Works great.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   So just looking at this panel,
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:17.980]   and maybe we're not typical,
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.980]   but we all have figured out how we're going to listen to music, right?
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:25.980]   We all have our thing that we do, whatever it is.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   Apple's got to take us and change how we do it.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.980]   Now they are offering us for free for three months.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   You don't think so?
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.980]   I don't think they do.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   I think that's the advantage of where Apple is here,
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.980]   by mixing a store in a streaming service,
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   they let you do what you want,
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   and you can buy some and stream some.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.980]   So people like you two who are iTunes guys,
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.980]   this is going to be a very natural transition.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.980]   Yeah, well, and I'm also a beat subscriber, so.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:54.980]   It's going to do that.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   Probably because Apple butte beats it.
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.980]   No, I actually checked it out before then.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.980]   I like the curation idea.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:58.980]   It's a nice service.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:30:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:00.980]   Okay.
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.980]   Also, don't play how big it is for Apple to have.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.980]   This is the music service that's going to come pre-installed
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:09.980]   on every single phone and every single iPad
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.980]   and then every single MacBook out there.
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:13.980]   And I think there's a reason why the Notes app,
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.980]   as bad as it, excuse me, as feature minus,
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   as it used to be, was the most popular Notes app on iOS
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:21.980]   because you was there.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:22.980]   You get it free.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.980]   You don't have to go and learn.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:24.980]   You don't have to choose.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.980]   And so with a whole bunch of the other side of our planet,
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.980]   people getting their first real iPhones,
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:32.980]   that's no small deal.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.980]   I mean, it's also the reason why the youth consumer dollar
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   is so valuable is because people,
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.980]   if you're between the ages of 13 and 27,
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:46.980]   you have not formed loyalty to a brand yet.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.980]   It's not so much that these people are so different
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.980]   but so much as they're open to having Pepsi or RC Cola
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.980]   instead of Coke.
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.980]   They're open to using this music service
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:56.980]   instead of this other music service.
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.980]   So once you get people thinking that,
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:31:59.980]   just like me thinking that,
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.980]   well, look, I'm using Amazon MP3 for buying music from.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.980]   I'm sure the others are great,
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.980]   but I don't really need to check it out anymore.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.980]   You get locked into your ways and that you want to get them
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:10.980]   before they're fontanels.
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.980]   Their consumer fontanels have closed in so to speak.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.980]   - Well, to Andy's point, I think one of the interesting things
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:17.980]   that's sort of downplayed in the initial announcement
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.980]   is how widely available Apple music seems to be.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:21.980]   They have not given any specific--
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:22.980]   - 100 countries, didn't they say?
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:23.980]   - Yeah, right.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:25.980]   Well, the Beats 1 certainly is in 100 countries.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:26.980]   I was just looking at the press release.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:28.980]   They're not specifying in the press release.
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.980]   They say music fans around the world.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.980]   Now, Apple does have the clout to potentially cut music deals
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.980]   that do include all of this because--
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:37.980]   - And that's a big deal.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:38.980]   - That is a very big deal.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.980]   - And that is something that Spotify has built up
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:45.980]   over many years, but I think 100 countries is more than Spotify.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:47.980]   - Right, and even if the Apple music,
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:49.980]   like the streaming service isn't available in all those countries,
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   even just having Beats 1 as a taste of that available in 100 countries,
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:54.980]   is a huge deal.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:55.980]   - I think you're right.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.980]   I think that's something that I actually mentioned that yesterday
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.980]   that Apple does, maybe thanks to Iaveen,
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:02.980]   have the clout with the record labels,
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.980]   probably more because they're the biggest retailer.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.980]   - Right.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:08.980]   - Although Amazon is really formidable.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:10.980]   - When you talk about the ATV-competing, yeah.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:11.980]   - The--
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.980]   - That co-plays Amazon only, right?
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.980]   - Yes.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.980]   - So that's one thing at least--
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:19.980]   - And my Android TV plays Google only.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:22.980]   That's one thing that we observed, I think Andy yesterday,
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:26.980]   was the increased silo-ification of--
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.980]   of all of these services.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:30.980]   They're more and more becoming,
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   you'll use Apple or you'll use Google or you'll use--
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   Microsoft's the one player that seems to want to play everywhere.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.980]   - Yeah.
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.980]   - But Apple and Google very much going in these separate tracks.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:44.980]   - On the TV side too, you know, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Google,
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:46.980]   everybody's got their own TV service that they want you to use,
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:50.980]   and that's tricky when you're trying to find the one show that you're looking for.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.980]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:55.980]   - That was another sort of continuing threat
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.980]   from during the keynote yesterday, I thought,
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:05.980]   where I don't think Apple still has the sort of power where they can kill Vesper
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:09.980]   or Evernote or other note-taking apps by improving notes.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:14.980]   I don't think that they can kill Flipboard or other news apps by creating their own,
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:20.980]   but I think that there is-- you're seeing a concerted effort to control more--
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.980]   and TICE users to let Apple control more of their experience
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.980]   and say, "Please never leave the Apple ecosystem."
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.980]   There's nothing bad about that at all,
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   but it seems as though they want to say,
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:34.980]   if we can observe and control the more of stuff you do,
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:40.980]   it will make it easier for us to give you great services like our Google Now type of thing
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:44.980]   without having to worry about sending your information to a third party,
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.980]   and also make sure that we have a measure of control about the data that's coming in.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:55.980]   And also being able to learn things not about you specifically,
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.980]   but about our customers in general,
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.980]   that we're not learning when we're sending people into a Google search
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:04.980]   or when we're sending people into Facebook to check out their newsfeed.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:08.980]   So maybe it's just the volume of announcements that were like that.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.980]   We're the saying, "We don't want you to use Spotify.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.980]   We don't want you to use Evernote.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.980]   We don't want you to use Flipboard.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:17.980]   We want you to use our Apple products."
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:21.980]   Maybe it's just the number of them coming at the same time that started make me think this.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.980]   There being a little bit more, I wouldn't say aggressive,
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:29.980]   but seeing the opportunity of what we can do if our users spend as much time
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:32.980]   underneath the Apple umbrella is possible.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:33.980]   Anything else to say about music?
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.980]   I thought we'd have much longer conversation.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.980]   It's not a disappointment.
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:38.980]   It's about right?
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   No, I think the presentation--
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:41.980]   It's just not exciting.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:42.980]   --was not good.
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:46.980]   I think that-- I mean, you always have these two levels with an Apple keynote.
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:49.980]   You've got your criticism of the stagecraft,
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:51.980]   and then you've got the breakdown of what I announced.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:56.980]   And I think on a stagecraft level, the rest of the show was really solid and very Apple,
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:01.980]   and then the music part was bloated and bad and was not their best effort.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:05.980]   And we can speculate about whether that's because they had to fill in for Apple TV at the last minute or not.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:06.980]   --and maybe, yeah.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.980]   But the service itself, I don't think in the end it's going to matter.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:11.980]   We're going to forget what the keynote stagecraft was,
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:13.980]   and the service will stand or fall on its own, giving it away for three months.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.980]   We're all going to get to try out and see if it's any good.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.980]   And if it's worth paying for.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.980]   That is probably the smartest thing, and the best thing Apple can do,
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.980]   which is just hope that people sample.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:25.980]   I don't find the radio station particularly compelling.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.980]   I'm not sure what the point of that is even.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:28.980]   It feels very rare.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.980]   It feels like Jimmy-- I'll be honest.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   It feels like Jimmy Iovin comes from an older era of music, record labels,
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:40.980]   who still thinks that DJs matter and that radio matters, and that this is something people want.
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:41.980]   But it matters to some people.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980]   It's a slice of the audience.
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:48.980]   My daughter has really gotten into radio on the satellite radio listening to the big pop stations
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:49.980]   from New York and LA.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.980]   So I think there was a teenager--
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.980]   Those are the most canned DJs of all.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.980]   I know.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.980]   I think that's the idea here is they want to be like radio one, BBC radio one,
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:58.980]   with this one.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:03.980]   And that is a popular, successful young station for people who love music.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:08.980]   It's not for everybody, but if they can get that group, that'll be good for them.
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.980]   Will they support Sonos?
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:12.980]   Will Sonos support them?
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:14.980]   Good question.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:15.980]   Good question.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.980]   That actually is a make or break for me.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.980]   I want to have it at my Sonos.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:21.980]   I think it defines one of the problems.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.980]   Question one is, is it going to be worth paying for?
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.980]   But then the question two, the big one is going to be,
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:31.980]   is it going to be worth switching away from whatever I'm using right now for?
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.980]   My hope about this is that since there's going to be an Android app,
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:38.980]   that Apple will be more open to getting these things on devices like Sonos.
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:42.980]   Because they want this to be something you can take everywhere,
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:44.980]   and Apple's hardware isn't everywhere.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:47.980]   But yeah, if you're somebody who's in existing,
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:49.980]   Sonos is probably a small subset.
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:53.980]   Yeah, but is Apple targeting stealing away existing people?
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.980]   Or is Apple trying to find new people who haven't tried it before?
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:59.980]   I think that's a better potential audience for them,
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.980]   maybe, than stealing away people from Spotify.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:02.980]   We'll see.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:06.980]   I get in this fight all the time about radio and whether,
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.980]   and that's funny because half my income comes from terrestrial radio,
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.980]   broadcast radio.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:14.980]   But I just don't see people listening to Ray.
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.980]   I mean, they listen in their car as the only place people listen to.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:19.980]   Do you hear daughter listening to home?
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:20.980]   Like do you have a little clock radio?
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.980]   She just pandora at home.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:25.980]   But in the car, she is always hitting the radio station.
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:28.980]   That almost feels like to me, she listens in the car because she doesn't have bandwidth.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.980]   That could be.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.980]   But not everybody has enough.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]   No, I know.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:33.980]   I mean, that we're moving.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   The one time my daughter buys music is because she's going on a long car trip
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   and she knows she can't use her data to stream.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:39.980]   Right.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:40.980]   So that is part of it.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.980]   When you look at Spotify and you compare that with the offerings on XM or Sirius,
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:47.980]   the satellite radio fails miserably.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:51.980]   No, I was thinking somebody on Twitter the other day asked me if I thought that Apple
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.980]   should buy Sirius XM and I thought, you know, that's not a terrible idea.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:55.980]   Oh, it's a terrible idea.
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.980]   No, no, because the satellite things are going to be dead.
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.980]   You just want to take the content and put it along.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:00.980]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.980]   Right.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:02.980]   You don't want to even want to be on the satellite.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:05.980]   Because that is, that business will be dead because everybody's going to just be
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:06.980]   streaming content from data.
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:08.980]   But you could take the content and do something with it.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:09.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:10.980]   That might be interesting.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:11.980]   Interesting.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:12.980]   Call me.
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:13.980]   [laughter]
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:14.980]   Sirius, what do we have to deal?
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:15.980]   I don't represent anybody.
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:18.980]   God, I thought we'd do an hour at least on the music thing.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:19.980]   I guess not.
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.980]   We could talk about eddy cue shirts, but let's not.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:23.980]   Eddy cue is becoming more and more.
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:27.980]   I mentioned yesterday, in every company, in every group, in every classroom,
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:31.980]   there's one person that's not like being bullied, but is the butt of the
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.980]   bully, but is the butt of many jokes.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:36.980]   Like, there's always a needles or a Prager or somebody.
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:39.980]   I bet you a big nerd ranch is one guy.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:41.980]   You kind of make jokes about it.
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:42.980]   Paul.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:43.980]   Paul.
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:44.980]   Eddy cue is Paul.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.980]   Eddy cue has become Paul.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.980]   He's like, "Oh, there's eddy again at the karaoke."
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.980]   And he's like, "What's the shirt with the one thing up?"
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:54.980]   And he's like living up to his...
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.980]   He's the guy he's schmoozing with the showbiz people.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:58.980]   I love him.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:39:59.980]   Good for you, Eddy.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:00.980]   And to the Warriors games.
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:06.980]   There was diversity on the Apple stage, but it was mostly New Jersey versus
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:08.980]   Carolina versus California, right?
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:09.980]   That was the diversity.
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:13.980]   We got two women Apple executives on stage.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:15.980]   That did not feel like diversity.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:18.980]   Well, it was more diverse than it's been because it wasn't just middle-aged
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.980]   -what's it guys? -Christie Turlington.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:21.980]   And it wasn't just model-
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.980]   Middle-aged joint guys and models.
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:26.980]   Well, look, you've got an executive in charge of Apple Pay.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:29.980]   I'm not saying anything about this particular panel, but...
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.980]   Yeah, we've heard diversity now, right?
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.980]   Our diversity couldn't come to...
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:34.980]   I'm the last guy you should talk about diversity.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:37.980]   We have the full spectrum from nerds to dewebs.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:40.980]   [laughter]
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   All right, anything else anybody wants to say about...
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:46.980]   Not just music, but about the whole thing.
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   Erin, you're looking forward to going back.
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:52.980]   What are the sessions you're most interested in attending?
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.980]   So, um...
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:56.980]   Gosh, let me see.
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:00.980]   I'm really excited about the search APIs on OS9.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:02.980]   Yeah, because it looks like search is going to be very broad now, right?
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:03.980]   It's smart.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:04.980]   It's a natural language.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.980]   Let users search inside my apps.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:07.980]   Oh.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.980]   And that's a new API.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:09.980]   Trusting.
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:11.980]   It's a spotlight on iOS 9.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:13.980]   What have they done to put natural language in there?
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:14.980]   How are they doing that?
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.980]   I think it's basically Siri.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:20.980]   Siri smarts, and then you give it keywords and things that it can search against.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:21.980]   I think that'd be exciting for it, too.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.980]   Very exciting.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:29.980]   I mean, whenever you talk about the Echo or Google Now or Siri, developers always saying,
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:31.980]   "Okay, well, how am I going to hook my software into this?"
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.980]   And this is sort of the first step towards that.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.980]   So, Google at I/O announced there was going to be an API for Google Now.
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:39.980]   Right.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.980]   And now we're seeing this searchability at a OS9.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:43.980]   iOS 9.
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:45.980]   So, I'm excited about that.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.980]   I don't know if anybody cares.
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:50.980]   I'm looking at some of the notes from the Apple music.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:56.980]   We'll stream it 256 kilobits, not the extreme version available on 320.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.980]   It's Spotify of 320, and of course, title offers CD quality, uncompressed CD quality.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.980]   Is that a problem?
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:04.980]   Does anybody care?
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:05.980]   I don't think anybody cares.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:06.980]   Can't anybody hear the difference?
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:11.980]   And if they can, they'll update later like they did in the past with iTunes music, right?
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.980]   When they had iTunes Plus and stuff.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:15.980]   iTunes Plus is 320 kilobits.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:16.980]   AC.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:17.980]   AC.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:21.980]   And this is a little disappointing.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:28.500]   Apple's music will not include streaming Beatles, even though you can buy the Beatles in the iTunes
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:29.500]   store, you will not be able to stream.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.980]   Another opportunity for Apple core to get some me to show you.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.980]   What the hell is wrong?
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:36.980]   Are they the last that Metallica's given up?
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:37.980]   Right?
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.980]   The Stones gave up?
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:39.980]   Led Zeppelin gave up.
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:41.980]   Does the Taylor Swift took her bone?
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:45.980]   I'm surprised that Apple didn't lock down those rights when they negotiated their giant Beatles
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.980]   deals all those years ago.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:49.780]   Because Steve Jobs said we will never stream.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.780]   People want to own music.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.860]   That's why I think they're just smart enough to know that there's no other band that's
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:57.860]   like the Beatles.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:00.740]   There's nothing that has that sort of representation inside the library.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:04.260]   So given that they're already making money hand over fist, they can just simply say,
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.980]   we're willing to wait and let you dangle and not have the Beatles count.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.980]   And when they get it, they'll be exclusive.
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:09.980]   They'll be exclusive.
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:12.500]   The giant event, too, and talk about how exciting it is.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.900]   Let's hope they're still Beatles alive to be part of that keynote.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:20.900]   I should be clear, if you bought the Beatles from iTunes, you'll get streaming.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.900]   It'll be an awesome streaming.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:25.900]   That's part of the streaming library that you get access to when you buy your $10 a month.
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:26.900]   Right.
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:30.500]   And I presume because I've bought the Beatles so many times, not on iTunes, but everywhere
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:35.900]   else, including uploaded these 24 bits, that I will be able to stream it as my part of my
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:36.900]   own library.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:37.900]   Certainly.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:42.420]   Anything I own, I can stream, even if it's something like a daily GizWiz theme song.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:47.380]   And you had a bootleg of some band's concert that was never released.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.780]   You could upload that and it would be there.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:53.060]   Taylor Swift did keep her album on beats.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.980]   So they will have Swift, right?
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:56.980]   Not that I'm...
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.980]   You mean the program?
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:58.980]   I'm not asking for my sales.
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:43:59.980]   You mean the program?
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.980]   She kept her albums, but not her new album, I think.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:05.380]   1984 is not...
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:07.940]   I mean, I think that's the name of her new album.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.620]   Sorry, I'm out of now.
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.300]   I like Taylor.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:14.900]   I'm a Swiftie.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.900]   Just making sure we got everything...
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.900]   1989.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:17.900]   I want to talk about one of our new four-star album.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.900]   You're out of here.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:19.900]   You're out of here.
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:20.900]   Oh, wow, you're right.
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:22.900]   Or George Orwell.
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:23.900]   Would you use that music?
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:24.900]   You're going up.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:26.900]   There's another story we want.
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:27.900]   Apples.
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.060]   I wanted to talk about our new course.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.060]   Please do.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:32.060]   Where is that here?
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.060]   Let's talk about your new course.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:40.620]   You are one of the small group of people working with Apple on this mobility partner
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.620]   program.
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:42.620]   What is this?
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:47.980]   So if you listen to the earnings call at the end of Q2, the CFO came forward and said,
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:48.980]   "Ipad sales."
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.780]   He was going over iPad sales.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.860]   They haven't been super stellar lately.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.780]   23% down, yeah.
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:45:00.780]   And so Apple is now in a very strange and radical and wonderful thing partnering with
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:05.900]   sort of best of breeds in the business world for software, for the...
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.420]   They did this for IBM, right?
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:09.220]   IBM was the first one.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.220]   And so they announced that there's now two dozen more.
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:16.220]   And you mentioned several of them, Box, DocuSign, Service Max.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.180]   One of the ones he didn't mention is Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.180]   Congratulations.
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:26.820]   We have taken responsibility for training the other mobility partners, engineers to
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:30.500]   make sure that they are ready to really level up their apps.
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:36.340]   So when IBM and Apple did their deal, IBM and Apple came to us and asked us to develop
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:37.820]   a special course.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:42.820]   And so if you go to the next link, we have of course, which is iOS development in Swift
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.820]   for the enterprise.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:44.900]   For the enterprise, wow.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.980]   And we have been teaching this all over the world for IBM.
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:48.900]   It's been really well received.
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.340]   It's Swift.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:52.900]   It's the fundamentals of iOS development.
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.340]   And then there's a bunch of enterprise-specific topics for business programmers, which is
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:46:03.460]   encryption using the keychain, using web services and caching the results and core data.
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:09.260]   So we're really excited about this particular program and we'll be helping make applications
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:13.700]   for iOS in the business world that much better.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:14.700]   Congratulations.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:15.700]   That's exciting.
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:16.700]   It's very exciting.
[01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:17.700]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.660]   BignerdRanch.com.
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:28.140]   And I imagine that porting an enterprise app from whatever the hell platform IBM has, Lotus
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:32.140]   123, I don't know, to iOS must be challenging for some of these.
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:33.140]   It is challenging.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.380]   But again, IBM has such a long history of great programming.
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:40.940]   It's sometimes logistically tricky to get everything together in the Philippines.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:43.660]   But once we get there, the engineers are always top-notch.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.660]   Nice.
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:48.300]   It's been really an honor to work with both IBM and Apple on this.
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:49.300]   All right.
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.100]   Prepare your picks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.100]   Dan Morin is here.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.940]   And Jason Snell, both from sixcolors.com.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.180]   BignerdRanch is Aaron Hillagas.
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:01.260]   And of course, Andy Anaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:07.020]   And each of them will offer you something wonderful when we come back.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.500]   But first a word from something wonderful.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.820]   LegalZoom.com, not a law firm.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.380]   I want to say this right up front.
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:14.540]   That's a good thing.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:17.860]   Because if you are an entrepreneur, you're starting a business.
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:21.740]   Last thing you want to do is spend thousands of dollars with a law firm to protect your
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:27.060]   business with an incorporation or an LLC or to trademark your brand and your products
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:29.620]   and your services or to apply for a patent.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:33.060]   And with LegalZoom, you don't have to spend thousands of dollars.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:36.140]   Because you can do it yourself at LegalZoom.com.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:37.140]   That's what I did.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:42.740]   And we're still using the operating agreement, the LLC papers that I filed 10 years ago
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:44.780]   with LegalZoom.com.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.980]   It's been great.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.620]   If you have a new business, protect your business, go to LegalZoom.com.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:53.140]   Now, you may end up with questions.
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:57.860]   And the nice thing, this is new relatively since I started using them.
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:04.140]   We've added now the LegalZoom legal plan, which is they can connect you with an independent
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:05.140]   attorney.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:09.660]   They've pre-negotiated flat rates with attorneys in almost every state of the union.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:15.860]   And you can talk to them and get your questions answered at an amazingly affordable price.
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.860]   They can even help you if you have a great idea, but you're not sure where to begin.
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:23.580]   LegalZoom.com, they're not a law firm, but you can get advice from LegalZoom's network
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.660]   of independent attorneys in most states.
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:29.540]   Plus, all the paperwork, all the stuff you need, the guidance, the step-by-step.
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:30.780]   You walk through it.
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:31.780]   They do it all.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:32.780]   I love it.
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:35.700]   We did our wills that way.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.780]   It's just incredible.

[01:48:53.740 --> 01:49:00.220]   They also have a pet agreement so that if you die, your pet goes to a good home.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:03.300]   And I'm just saying, I got to do that.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.500]   I got now a dog and two cats.
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:08.940]   I need the pet protection agreement.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:11.180]   Protect your pet.

[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:18.940]   All right, let's see.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.580]   Let's start with the Anubi around here.
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.500]   Dan Morin, what do you got?
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:26.620]   So recently I went to travel to Europe and I was looking for stuff to load up on my iPad.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.260]   I'm going in three weeks.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.260]   Give me good stuff.
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:30.260]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:33.020]   Specifically, I was looking for something to do when I was traveling on the plane.
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:34.020]   I did an internet.
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.260]   And so I decided I was really interested.
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:40.020]   I've been getting a little bit more and more into comics recently, again, having been a
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.340]   comic reader when I was a teenager.
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:45.100]   And I'm sure Jason and I know Andy are both comics readers as well.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:47.860]   But I picked up a free month of Marvel Unlimited.
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:48.860]   Oh, oh.
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:53.540]   Marvel's sort of Netflix-y like service where you can sign up for a monthly fee and read
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.420]   a bunch of comics, pretty much anything in their library.
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.660]   They've got a lot of older titles.
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.700]   They also have newer titles, although they tend to be a little more delayed.
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.740]   I think they're like six months or so.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:06.580]   But I've read a bunch of series on there and they let you do offline reading, which was
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:07.580]   huge for me.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:11.460]   So I could download a dozen titles that I could read on the plane.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.020]   So you can get as many as you want.
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:15.820]   Yeah, as many as you can sit on your iPad.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:19.820]   I mean, if you have an internet connection, you can read anything that's in their library.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:23.060]   If you want to download stuff offline, I think they give you a dozen slots sort of-
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:24.060]   Doesn't.
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.060]   Yeah, that's enough.
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.820]   And then you can swap them in and out then when you have an internet connection again.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:31.140]   But it's really been great and you don't- it's so much more affordable than trying to go
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:36.060]   out and buy comics issue by issue because you can pay one fee per month and you can
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:38.580]   sort of read anything in Marvel's library.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:41.660]   It's a great way to read, especially the storylines that go all across these different
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:42.660]   titles.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:45.620]   So, you know, sometimes they have these big events and they go across a dozen different
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:48.540]   titles and, you know, it's hard to keep track of them sometimes.
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:52.660]   So they do a nice job of sort of bringing those storylines together and putting them
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:53.660]   all in one single place.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:56.620]   And you're not going to do a good job of this table, however.
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:59.340]   I will say, yeah, they're not without their glitches.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:02.700]   Like, you know, apparently if you spend more money, you get nothing.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:03.700]   You get weird checkbox.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.700]   You get no checks.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.100]   That's a bad deal too.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:09.500]   That's like you get a figurine and you're in the fan club for 99 bucks.
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:10.500]   So don't buy that.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.500]   If you go with the basic one, go with the basic one.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.500]   That's a good deal.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:15.500]   Shh.
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.820]   There's a lot of access to great comic titles.
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:20.660]   So $10 a month, 15,000 titles.
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.060]   I've not read any of these.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:23.060]   So it's really for me.
[01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.060]   There you go.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:25.060]   You can start right out there.
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:26.060]   Yeah.
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:27.060]   And I don't.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:28.060]   It doesn't take very long for you to earn that $69 a year.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.940]   Let me tell you that's like two plane rides and you've read more than $70.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:37.340]   When the issues goes for three or four bucks these days, you can make up $10 pretty fast.
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:38.340]   Cool.
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:43.060]   The price of comics trying to drove me off of particularly Marvel comics because you
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:46.700]   don't get a full story with one issue and you read it in 10 minutes and you have to
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:51.740]   read a year's worth of not only this one Avengers comic, but this also this other Avengers
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.980]   comic and it was the Marvel and limited that got me back because I'm willing to wait like
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:00.100]   six months to a year but then be able to actually read all of this like in one sitting
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:01.260]   where I can really actually follow it.
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.580]   It's a great deal.
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:05.820]   Like my parents will be really happy because I can get rid of that last shoebox of comics
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:07.300]   that was in their attic forever.
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:08.300]   So it's a space.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.300]   I am amazed.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.300]   They didn't sell them.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:12.060]   I don't think they're worth anything.
[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:15.420]   I'm amazed they didn't burn them or something.
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.420]   You have good parents.
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:17.940]   Yeah, they're well librarians.
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:18.940]   They're very opposed to burning.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.940]   He's sort of reading material.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:25.100]   That's why my daughter's been gone a week and I've already thrown our stuff at.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.420]   Takes no time for me.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.140]   Jason Snell, what do you got?
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:29.580]   It's actually a little bit of breaking news.
[01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:34.220]   So I have a Tivo DVR at home and I love it.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:39.620]   And you've been able to for a while now watch your Tivo programs from your DVR on iOS in
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:41.660]   your house or out of your house.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:47.700]   But I'm sitting there at my desk working on my Mac and I want to call up a live broadcast
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.540]   or a show that's on the DVR.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.740]   And I can't because they support iOS but they don't support the Mac.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:59.180]   Well today they release Tivo Online which is online.tivo.com and you log in with your
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:04.140]   Tivo account on your Mac or PC with your web browser.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.820]   And as long as you're in the house with the DVR they haven't yet got the out of the phone.
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:07.820]   Oh, I can't do it out here.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:08.820]   You can't do it out here.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.780]   Well as long as you're in the house hopefully they'll add some out of home because you've
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:12.780]   got that on iOS.
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:18.220]   But if you're in the house you can stream your live TV or your recordings to your computer
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:20.220]   from your DVR which you couldn't use to do.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.220]   And it's nice.
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:22.220]   Wow.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.220]   Because I get the baseball game on there.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:26.300]   That's the way I can get a little baseball game up in the corner of my local team because
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:29.580]   you can't stream that with the MLB app but you can do it from the Tivo.
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:31.540]   I liked it when I was called area.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:32.540]   Too soon.
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:33.540]   Too soon.
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.540]   Too soon.
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:38.420]   No, but I love my Tivo and the fact that I can watch my...
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:42.020]   I just recently discovered I could take out my iPad and watch my Tivo and work on that.
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.020]   Yeah, it's like your iPad is a TV.
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:44.020]   All my recordings.
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.900]   So now your Mac and PC can be a TV too.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.500]   That is nice.
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:50.900]   And you think they'll ever have it so that I could do it remotely?
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:57.220]   I'm sure they will at some point because they already do that on iOS and Android.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:58.420]   So it's just a matter of time.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:02.300]   I think perhaps it was too complicated for them to implement it on the PC.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.700]   I could see all my recordings.
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:06.220]   I guess that would be so that I could record more stuff.
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:11.660]   They've got links to the streaming versions of those shows as well as what's on your recordings
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:12.660]   on your DVR.
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.660]   Oh, so if I click this...
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.660]   I think it would be a comedy central.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:17.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:18.660]   I get it.
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:19.660]   Well, hey, that's better than nothing.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:21.660]   And I hope that they eventually let me do this for me.
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:25.500]   Yeah, I assume that would be stage two and maybe there's some rights issues to have to
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:26.500]   work out.
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.500]   I still have to Romeo did that.
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:28.500]   Sorry.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:29.500]   Oh, it takes me HP OK.
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:31.500]   Well, I have a subscription to that.
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:32.500]   So what the hell?
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.500]   Good tip.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.500]   Breakingnewsonline.tv.com.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:37.500]   Aaron Hill, I guess.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.180]   What do you got for us?
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:43.860]   So there is a mini series going on the National Geographic channel that is great fun.
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:48.860]   And it's funny to remember that everything that we work in was once made up by somebody.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:53.620]   And these were people with all the flaws and challenges of being people.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:57.100]   And so this, a lot of them are people pitted against each other.
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:00.300]   So like Edison versus Tesla and Oppenheimer versus Heisenberg.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:01.300]   Oh.
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.480]   And I'm bringing this up on Mac Break Weekly because on June 1st they aired jobs versus
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.480]   gates.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:12.220]   And it's a combination of both a dramatization and also some talking heads first hand historical.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.220]   Look at that.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:16.940]   The competition to control the personal computer.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:17.940]   1974.
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:19.940]   So I thought you were probably enjoying it.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:20.940]   What fun is that?
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.020]   That looks great.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:24.020]   And so it is dramatize.
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:26.620]   I mean, there's a guy who looks kind of like Bill and yeah.
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.620]   That's neat.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:29.620]   And then there's a pretty good website.
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:30.620]   And actually a pretty good website.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:32.340]   The website is pretty interesting.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:36.640]   Allowing gives Bill Gates an article that will change history.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.760]   Jobs and Wozniac for this is really nicely done.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:40.760]   Wow.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:42.640]   What a website.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.600]   American Genius and the most recent one.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.560]   You can probably presume can go back in the.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:51.400]   They're online jobs versus gates.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.360]   And this and actually the online site is pretty rich.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.520]   It's pretty, it's full of stuff.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:00.320]   Andy and I co pick of the week.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.700]   My pick is a really cool simple service that weighs the navigation app.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.440]   The current navigation app has rolled out.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.160]   They have created a whole set of like 50 to 60 different Twitter accounts that do nothing
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.360]   but tell you about unusual traffic situations in a specific city.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:22.240]   So if you subscribe to like the Boston Twitter account, every time users of the ways app
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:28.200]   are reporting a situation that ways noses unusual for that time of day or that location,
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:29.200]   it will tweet out.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:30.200]   Here is what's happening.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.080]   There's a major accident on near exit three near where I'm on I 95.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.480]   There is a there's construction on this place.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.480]   It's not like a flood of stuff either.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.400]   It's like it's truly stuff where there is a major accident.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:47.240]   Commute times have been are now 27 minutes slower.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:48.240]   It's curated.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.040]   I believe it's curated a little bit because some of these look like they're automatically
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.000]   generated whenever the system sees that there is an unusual situation happening.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.120]   But then when it looks like it's an ongoing thing, then you start to see the human sort
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.400]   of touch.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:07.560]   There was a situation I was I subscribe to the Boston one, but the Boston one actually
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.960]   covers much, much more than Boston metro areas like the entire like Eastern New England,
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.000]   like commuter belt along I 95.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.640]   And so there was some sort of an event happening near Providence that I was just watching because
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:23.400]   it's a little bit like, you know, watching a sports score saying how far is this going
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:27.440]   and it got from like 20 minute delay down to like an hour long delay.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.240]   And then they were using words like brutal.
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:34.880]   And then and then you click through and see and see like a map that's actually you can
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:38.880]   actually see it like a virus like expanding as cars are trying to root around it.
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.560]   Now all kinds of roads around are getting like are turning from orange to red.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:46.600]   And you know that, okay, I was going to run every this afternoon, but I'm not going to
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.320]   do that today or I was I know I've got to be somewhere at 4 p.m. but I'm not definitely
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.440]   I'm definitely not going to try driving that way.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.080]   For years, I've been hoping and expecting that there'd be a simple service that would
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.880]   simply tell me what's traffic like today?
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.520]   What am I going to run into if I try to be on this road?
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:05.320]   And there are you know, with Google Maps and with the ways and other apps, there are
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.000]   ways to sort of maybe find that out.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.640]   But this is by far the best system I've ever seen that was simply alert you to a situation
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.920]   that you want to know about at the time you want to know about it.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.840]   There is mostly US cities.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.720]   They're about 60 in total and about maybe a dozen of them are internationals outside
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:28.040]   the United States of America, but they seem to be doing a good job of getting this live
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.280]   for most metro areas.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.640]   There's a San Francisco one of it.
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.560]   There's Boston, there's Denver, there's you have a good chance of checking it out.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.080]   And like I said, there have been times in the past two or three weeks since I discovered
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:44.240]   this that I have changed my plans based on what I saw on my Twitter feed.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:49.080]   I'm going to recommend something I haven't watched, but Steve Gibson's been raving about
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:50.080]   it.
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.080]   Mr. Robot.
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:52.080]   Has anybody watched it yet?
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:57.960]   Steve's going to premiere June 24th on USA Networks and they've put the first episode
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.920]   up and people are raving.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.480]   Did you watch it?
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:07.160]   Because it's the first time on network television that the technology has actually been accurate
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.360]   and right, right?
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:12.320]   Steve, Steve says it's amazing.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:14.760]   If you want to have some fun, they have a great promo site.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:22.060]   Who is MrRobot.com that will give you a fake Unix prompt, Linux prompt and all sorts
[01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:23.060]   of stuff.
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:24.140]   But this looks very interesting.
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:30.620]   It's about a hacker who has decided that there's something going on and he doesn't know what
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:34.220]   it is, but he's going to, it looks great.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:37.300]   You can get it for free on iTunes as well, I believe.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:41.980]   And of course at the USA Network's website and the show itself will be on television starting
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:43.900]   on the 24th.
[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.500]   But we'll be talking about it.
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:50.780]   Steve's already warned me on security now in just a few minutes.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:58.900]   Who is MrRobot.com or just go to USA Network and watch the pilot for MrRobot.
[01:59:58.900 --> 01:59:59.900]   There he is.
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:03.140]   He's wearing a hoodie so you know it's technically accurate.
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.140]   Very important.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:05.860]   Hey boy, what a great panel.
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:07.220]   I want to thank you all for being here.
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:08.300]   It's really nice to have you.
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:11.140]   Dan Morin, sixcolors.com, macworld.com.
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:13.740]   You have other podcasts?
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:18.860]   Yes, the rebound, which is at reboundcast.com and clockwise, which I do with Mr. Snell, which
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:22.420]   is over relay.fm/clockwise.
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:24.700]   Is the rebound all about NBA basketball?
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:26.620]   It is nothing to do with NBA basketball.
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:30.260]   I'm excited about the Warriors and Game 3 is tonight.
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.340]   I thought maybe that's what you'd be.
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:34.700]   It's Lex Friedman, John Moltz and myself talking about technology.
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.700]   Oh, that's awesome.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.700]   John Moltz.
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.700]   Talking about technology.
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:38.700]   Oh, good.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:39.700]   For short and occasionally maybe a little irreverent.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:40.700]   Let's play that way.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.700]   Sounds like fun.
[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:42.700]   It is.
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:44.100]   Jason Snell's at sixcolors.com.
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:45.100]   Great place to go.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.820]   Have you had any trouble with your Apple Watch, like losing your phone and not...
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:51.260]   Not giving you notifications and stuff like that.
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:52.260]   No, it's been doing pretty well.
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:53.540]   Lisa's happened all sorts of trouble.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.660]   Mine is very sporadic on notifications.
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:57.220]   Like sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:58.220]   Just curious.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:00:59.220]   It's working okay for me.
[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:00.380]   I think it's dopey.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:01.380]   I hear that.
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:02.380]   I hear that.
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:05.060]   I'm just really rubbing it in now.
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:06.620]   It's just dopey.
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:07.620]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.620]   It's great to see you.
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:09.620]   Love it when you come up here.
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:10.620]   Always.
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:11.620]   Keep coming back.
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.620]   You too, Aaron Hill, I guess.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:13.620]   It's my big nerd, Ranchers in Atlanta.
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:18.340]   And boy, I'm really jealous on the West Coast at the beautiful Asilomar.
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.340]   Conference center.
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:21.060]   These who do the TED conference there.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:22.060]   Yeah.
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.060]   That's where the TED conference began.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:24.860]   When are you in Asilomar?
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:26.660]   You go on the website and find the schedule.
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.020]   I might do that one.
[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:29.020]   Yeah, it's fun.
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:30.020]   Because that's a beautiful one.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.940]   I used to live in Pacific Grove in a rundown of the 20, what is it, the 21 mile?
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:37.180]   3Dio, iOS, Mac, Android, JavaScript.
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:38.180]   Fun.
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:39.780]   So what's that just Apple?
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:40.780]   No.
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:41.780]   Anything you want.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:42.780]   Anything you want, I'll teach you.
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:44.780]   You got a Lisp course.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:45.780]   Some days soon.
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:46.780]   You want to work on that.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:49.180]   Andy and I go Chicago Suntimes.
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:50.180]   Always a pleasure.
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:52.980]   Cwob.com is his personal website.
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.380]   And he's here every Tuesday.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:57.500]   Rene, I guess, is traveling home, which is why he wasn't here.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:59.300]   But he will be back, I'm sure, next week.
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:03.060]   I'm looking forward to hearing him talk about all the services that are not available in
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:04.060]   Canada.
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:05.060]   Oh, man.
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:06.060]   We had Georgia Dow on.
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:11.060]   And every time they announced up the new, it was like, oh, believe it.
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:12.060]   It's available in Belize.
[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:13.660]   But come on.
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:18.140]   Yeah, that'll be back next Tuesday.
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:21.780]   We do ads when we do Mac break weekly every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:22.780]   time, 1,800 UTC.
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:29.060]   It's nice if you can watch live or join us as a good number of people did in studio.
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:30.060]   Email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:31.340]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:33.980]   We'll try to find you one of the comfortable ones.
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:34.980]   Sorry, Oliver.
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:37.660]   Oh, that doesn't look very comfortable.
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:42.380]   But if we can't, the sooner the email, the sooner the better your chance of getting a
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:43.380]   comfortable chair will be.
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:44.380]   Let's put it that way.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:49.980]   If you can't watch it live in studio or on the internet, you can always download on-demand
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:53.860]   audio or video at TwiP.tv/MBW.
[02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:56.620]   The new site goes up tomorrow, day after tomorrow.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:00.500]   So if you get there and it looks all weird and different, that's why.
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.940]   But you can also get it at iTunes or whatever they call it these days.
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:05.780]   They still call it iTunes.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:06.780]   Who knows?
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:07.780]   We don't know.
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.580]   Apple Music Tune.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:14.380]   And all the other podcast places, including probably three or four apps on your phone,
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:15.380]   including those TwiP.
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:16.660]   You have a TwiP on your phone.
[02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:18.060]   You should put one there if you don't.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:19.060]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:20.700]   Now back to work because you know what?
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:22.700]   Break time is over.
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:22.900]   Bye-bye.
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:33.300]   [Music]
