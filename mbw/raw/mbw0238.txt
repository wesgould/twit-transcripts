[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   And now, I guess we might have some Macners.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.760]   I don't know.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760]   Seems unlikely.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.120]   Here are our panelists.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.680]   Today, quick, find some Macners.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.560]   Mr. Alex Lindsay from Pixel Core.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.600]   I'm here fully prepared here.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.320]   I have my iPhone, my iPad, my--
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   You do have a Mac in front of you.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.280]   I do have a Mac.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.840]   I almost didn't bring it.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.600]   I bought the new Mac.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240]   I'm going to talk about that a little bit.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   I have a new Mac.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.840]   I'm jealous.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.240]   I'm excited.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.480]   I really like it.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.920]   Also with us from his earthquake impregnable layer,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560]   mostly because there are no earthquakes there,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.680]   Andy and Akko in blast.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.760]   And there aren't any earthquakes, are there?
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   Actually, there are, but they're so--
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080]   No.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   No.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   When we talk about what's going on,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.840]   then I'll swim the world.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.440]   No, we don't.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.960]   Nothing like that.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.440]   Andy works for the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.080]   where he's currently writing his review for the iPad, too.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.280]   He's also at the cwob.com.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.360]   And actually, we started the show before the show,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.200]   on the pre-show talking, of course, about the big story.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.360]   And sometimes I even feel really guilty when
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.040]   there's a story like this horror in Japan talking
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.320]   about gadgets in any way, shape, or form.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   Because it seems so unimportant, so trivial,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   compared to the serious stuff going on.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.560]   So we did talk a little bit about that at the beginning.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   We will talk-- actually, there's a very interesting article
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960]   covered in Rose published on his blog about how the Apple
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.280]   Store responded in Tokyo to the earthquake.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.440]   But one thing-- before we get deep into the weeds on the iPad,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.640]   too, because we all three of us, I see, have one.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.320]   Andy's got one over his shoulder.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.480]   I don't know how he's doing that.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   It's magical and revolutionary.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.640]   Apple set me the 17-inch iPad.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   Bastard.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.960]   They didn't send you one?
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yeah, you were.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.680]   Bastard.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.640]   But also, we can talk about the new Max,
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440]   because I have the new MacBook Pro,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.800]   so we'll talk about those.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.920]   And lots more news.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.600]   But I did-- we started, and I wanted
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.080]   to kind of repeat it on the show, talking about the earthquake.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.840]   And there are a number of stories relevant to the Japanese
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.760]   earthquake and our beat.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   You can, for instance, donate to Japan.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   Earthquake really fire iTunes, which I think is pretty cool.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.720]   And Apple will not take 30% of the revenue, all of it goes.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.360]   But I also want to point people to a--
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.480]   one of the things that is going on right now that's
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.760]   of great concern is the state of the nuclear reactors
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.320]   in Japan, some of which are quite old, four decades old,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.960]   and some concern about another Chernobyl, or another Three
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.680]   Mile Island.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.360]   There is a really good resource that I trust down the road
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.160]   from you, and it's called the Massachusetts Institute
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.640]   of Technology.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   Heard of it.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.320]   Yep, heard of it.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.280]   I think they're pretty good.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.160]   And they got a school.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.680]   I think they're doing-- is it engineering?
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.520]   Engineering.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.080]   They have a nuclear science and engineering department
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.920]   and a blog that has been doing a fantastic job covering
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   the meltdowns or whatever is going on, the explosions
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.800]   at the units.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.040]   And I would point you to this.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.400]   It's easy to find.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.920]   It's MITNSE.com, MITNSE.com.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.600]   That's the short URL.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.840]   Start, though, deep down in it, there is--
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.560]   if you go farther back in time, there
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.600]   was a post on March 13th describing
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.840]   how these plants were constructed, how they work.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.080]   And I have to say, almost every mainstream report I've seen
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.560]   has some significant factual errors compared to this report,
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.640]   which I think is probably factually much more accurate.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.440]   And then you can go back up in time
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.920]   and read the most recent reports.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.640]   And as the story develops, they are posting on it,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   for instance, today they posted an explanation
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.680]   of hydrogen explosions at units one and three.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.440]   You'll understand much better what's going on,
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.560]   what the actual risks are, as opposed
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.960]   to the kind of sensationalistic risks that some of the media
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.360]   is reporting, and so forth.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.680]   So that's a good place to start if you're worried about that.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.120]   It is going to-- right now, the RAM factories and the NAND
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.680]   factories are shut down.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.720]   There's a lot of speculation going on about--
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.280]   a price speculation going on in RAM and NAND flash.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.760]   People are-- the prices have jacked up immediately.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.000]   But it's not immediately clear that those prices are
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.440]   going to go up.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.760]   The plants-- most of the plants are not in the affected area.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.800]   They're currently shut down, but they will be able to go back
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   online.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.960]   I mean, one of the big things is it
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.240]   doesn't look like there's a lot of damage
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.160]   to the actual plants.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.400]   But one of the issues is that a lot of these plants
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.560]   are extremely energy intensive, and they
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   need solid power all the time, because they're
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.280]   dealing with heat-based processes.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.480]   And right now, they're having rolling power cuts.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   And so they just can't turn the back on until that sorts
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.560]   itself out.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.840]   And with the problems that we're seeing with the power
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.680]   infrastructure in Japan right now,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.160]   it's unclear when that will happen.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.880]   But that's what people speculate on, I guess.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.080]   They're gambling.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.040]   It's like oil prices.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.320]   Yeah, it's totally based on the future, not on the present.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.400]   But it does look like it could be bad for ram prices
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.600]   and flash prices.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.200]   And of course, we rely heavily on flash,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.640]   because our iPads and our iPods are all flash-based.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.440]   My SSDs.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   SSDs, yeah.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.040]   Those factories are not in the Sendai area,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.800]   but there are silicon wafer fabs there.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.720]   So some silicon chips are made in the Sendai area.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.920]   I think it's 60%.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.480]   So that's an issue.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.160]   Those are the wafers that are then
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.960]   used by other plants to make the processors and so forth.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.320]   So nothing to say, except that be aware.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.520]   Right.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.080]   There could be some shortages.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.680]   There's certainly going to be some shortages
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.920]   in things like electric vehicles.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.800]   Yeah, but the people I talked to a few days ago,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.320]   just in that it wasn't a Q&A.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.720]   It was just a conversation about this sort of stuff.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.520]   We're telling me that it would be something
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.920]   you would feel about two or three years down the road.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.320]   That far, wow.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.080]   Well, because there's so much planning
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.440]   happens so much so far in advance.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.320]   So many people are companies stockpile what they need.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.720]   And they also make sure that they have production ramped up
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.120]   to a level where they can sort of buffer that sort of stuff.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.000]   They-- the consenting opinion amongst these two or three
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.560]   people were that if there is any sort of a negative knock-on
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.520]   effect for consumers, it's going to be financial planners who
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   decide that we had better-- just what if this doesn't get fixed?
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.400]   What if people are-- right now we're being advised
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.520]   that there is not going to be a big problem with this.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.720]   But what if we're wrong?
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.600]   We had better make sure that we buffer in some profits this year
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.760]   to make sure that we can suffer next year or the year
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.160]   after in case these things happen.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.800]   We've already sort of seen that in the stock market
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.960]   where people-- they don't understand
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.000]   what parts of the industry have been affected,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.320]   who the suppliers are, what they're supplying to.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.880]   All they know is earthquakes are extremely bad and disruptive.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.840]   And that basically turns everybody into a very, very
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.120]   topsy-turvy sort of investor.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.640]   So a lot of money is moving based on just fear and panic.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.760]   And that's usually the worst part.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.440]   Beyond-- I'm sorry-- beyond the human toll.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.880]   That's often compounds an already terrible situation.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.520]   Well, just something to be aware of.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.480]   I mean, two years from now, we can look back and say, oh, yeah,
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.880]   that's why the iPad is 100 bucks more, or perhaps not.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.600]   It could happen.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.680]   Well, in some ways, I think that given that this is a Mac show,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.200]   Apple may be in a good position related this,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.080]   because I think they've bought a lot of this up.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.920]   So they bought-- they bought probably-- they have probably
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.120]   a larger supply of these components than anyone else
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.680]   in the world.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.880]   Right.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.880]   Well, they're selling them fast.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.640]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.400]   But continuing with the earthquake story for a little bit
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.840]   longer, I just wanted to point to Kevin Rose's blog,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.200]   where he reprints a letter.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.840]   It says, this email is from a friend of mine
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.680]   that works for Apple in Japan.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.760]   I actually know him.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.160]   I'm Alex L.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.680]   You're Alex L. So you also got this email.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.400]   Yeah, he mentions Twim in here and Twit.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.200]   Yeah, he's a great guy.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.960]   We won't mention his name, I guess, name redacted to protect
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.800]   his-- I don't know.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.520]   That's what Kevin did.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.680]   I don't know.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.640]   Yeah, no, I got the same email.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.880]   And he was very, very generous with information.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.080]   He just didn't want to be identified.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.800]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.200]   He works at one of the Apple stores in Japan.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.240]   He says, the earthquake hit while I was working in one
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   of their stores is the entire building swayed.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.760]   The staff commonly led people from the top five floors
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.520]   down to the first floor and under the ridiculously
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.760]   strong wooden tables.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   We've all seen those that hold a display computer.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.320]   I'm going to guess this is at the-- well,
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.920]   I'm going to guess there's a five story high store in Ginza.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.120]   That must be it, then, in Tokyo.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.400]   Yeah, in Tokyo, it's the coolest--
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.320]   I mean, it's the most amazing Apple store I've ever seen.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   This is what's interesting.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.160]   Seven hours and 118 aftershocks later, the store was still open.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.920]   That's because with phone and train lines down,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.360]   taxi stops and millions of people stuck in the Tokyo shopping
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.120]   district scared, no access to television.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.400]   Hundreds of people were swarming into the Apple stores
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.120]   to watch the news on Ustream and to contact their families
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.400]   via Twitter, Facebook, and email.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.040]   The young did it on their mobile devices
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.880]   while the old clustered around the max.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.040]   There were even some Android users there.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.360]   He adds there are almost no free Wi-Fi spots in Japan
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   besides the Apple store.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.200]   So even Android users often come to the stores to borrow the Wi-Fi.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.080]   He says, it's kind of like in the disaster movies
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.480]   how people gathered around the electronics stores
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.520]   to watch the TV in the windows.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.640]   I love that part.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.840]   He says, in the digital age, that's
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.920]   what the Tokyo Apple stores became.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.480]   A staff brought out surge protectors and extension cords
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.280]   with tens of iOS device adapters so people could charge
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.960]   their phones and iPads and contact their loved ones.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.720]   Even after we finally had to close at 10 PM crowds of people
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.880]   huddled in front of the store to use the Wi-Fi into the night,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.360]   it was still the only way to get access to the outside world.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.000]   He says, I mention this not because I'm a fanboy or an Apple
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.200]   employee, but because I'm genuinely proud of the Apple
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.280]   Japan staff and their willingness to stay open to help
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.320]   people that day.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.400]   Also impressed with the way Apple's products and yes,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.920]   Google's, Twitter's, and Facebook's helped them that day,
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.040]   even after we had to close many of the staff stayed outside
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.680]   the store fixing iPhones and teaching people how to contact
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.720]   family or stay informed via Wi-Fi.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.160]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.520]   Now he's also talks a little bit more about how,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.000]   because of the trains down, people in Tokyo
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.320]   stranded in the city, hotels booked the roads jammed,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.200]   people were actually sleeping in the Apple stores.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.640]   Apple told all of their staff, retail, and corporate,
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.120]   they could go sleep at the Apple stores.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.920]   The senior managers had unbeknownst to us gone out to stock
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.760]   on food and drinks after the first quake hit.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.040]   They kind of knew this might be crucial.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.240]   I don't know if you've seen the pictures in Tokyo of the
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.440]   supermarket shelves just empty, cleared.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.360]   So people are actually sheltering at the Apple stores.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.760]   So that's really a fantastic story.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.320]   Isn't it great that companies can, a company, especially one
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.880]   we all are already like so much, can just use common sense
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.120]   in these things where this is not a normal situation.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.760]   We can help so many people just by simply saying,
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.680]   if you work for us by all means sleep here, yes,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.160]   we will take care of you.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.840]   If you're people off the street, if you need,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.880]   it wasn't just the Wi-Fi.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.120]   They had every single charger that they could find plugged
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.320]   in and ready to go so that if you're cut out,
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.880]   if you can't get home and you're down to your last 10 minutes
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.600]   worth of life on your battery, come into the Apple store,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.240]   they have chargers, plug in, cop off your batteries.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.040]   They also were telling people according to the email.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.400]   They're also telling their employees that if you feel as
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.600]   though you need to get home, we will cover all,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.160]   and you think you can do so safely, we will cover any
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.880]   expense you have to suffer in order to get home.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.280]   Considering that in some cases, this was a 10 hour walk
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.440]   and there might have been a case where they might need to
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.760]   find a hotel, any hotel, the email was actually even said
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.640]   that they're very clear.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.880]   If all you can find is a luxury hotel, that's the only room
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.040]   that's available and you need to stay there overnight.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.720]   Stay there, get the receipt, we will compensate you for
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.480]   the expenses and gain your loved ones.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   That is just stellar, stellar relationship with your
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.720]   employees and your community.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.440]   - It says executives from Cupertino in London
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.040]   FaceTimed with us, letting us know not to worry.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.920]   They supported us and they would write off on all of it.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.640]   And they told him personally, my manager called to let me know
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.720]   that Apple will support any decision I make regarding
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.080]   leaving the country or the area and that a job will still
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.960]   be waiting for me if I decide to come back.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.680]   That's pretty cool.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.760]   So kudos to Apple for handling that, right?
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.840]   - And for all we know, when these kinds of things happen,
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.240]   I have to say people tend to step forward and act,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   well, there are always some bad actors, but most people
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.200]   tend to step forward and act well and I'm pleased to see
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.920]   that Apple's doing that, but I imagine other corporations
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.600]   are doing the same thing, I would hope other corporations
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.440]   are doing the same thing.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.600]   - But I think by nature, I think a lot of them aren't,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.040]   that's what they're doing.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.880]   - That's what you do.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.320]   You try to figure it out, you know, case by case basis.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.160]   - That's what you do.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.120]   You stand up for your employees, you take care of them,
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.200]   you do what you have to do and you bite the bullet
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.600]   and of course there'll be huge losses all across the board.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.440]   Toyota said they're gonna ship 40,000 fewer cars this year
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.480]   because of this, I mean, just huge loss.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.200]   I can only imagine not the economic loss of course,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.800]   but then the loss of life and family and just a huge tragedy.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   Anything more that we wanna say, I would like to put together,
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.600]   and we're gonna try to put together a special later today
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.200]   that maybe we can talk a little bit more,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.760]   maybe get Dr. Kiki and some of her nuclear experts
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.080]   talk a little bit more about what's actually going on
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.120]   or what we think is going on in Japan
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.920]   with those nuclear power plants, but we'll leave it at that.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.560]   And certainly our prayers go out to everybody in Japan.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   We have many listeners in Japan, and if you're listening,
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.880]   we were hanging on every news report
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.160]   and wishing for the best for you.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.480]   And of course, I'm contributing to the Red Cross,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.520]   but I hope everybody is, I just wanna pledge $100 a day
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.840]   as long as needed on behalf of the Twit family
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.960]   to make sure that they get the resources they need.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.600]   They really step in at a time like this.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.880]   And what we already know from Haiti, from New Zealand,
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.760]   from Chile is that the Red Cross is vital
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.640]   to people in times like this.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.520]   So I think that's a good place to go.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.440]   Be very careful, there are scammers out there.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.240]   I can't, it's hard to believe anybody would have the lack
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.960]   of decency to scam on a situation like this,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.280]   but if you go to redcross.org,
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   you know you're contributing to the right people.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.360]   And as I said, iTunes also makes it possible,
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.120]   very easy to do so.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.240]   - As far as easy as it gets.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.680]   - Yeah, that might be the way to do it.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.120]   All right, enough.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.920]   We've said it, and I wanted to start with that
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.840]   just because I think that that is more important
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.080]   than anything we could possibly say about a iPad 2,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.160]   but we do wanna talk about iPad 2.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   All three of us have them.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.920]   The two of you have tested the HDMI out.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.240]   I'm very interested to hear what happens with that.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.080]   That's exciting.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.460]   Andy, just one question.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.760]   Did you have one last week?
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:25.200]   - Apple unusually put me on a two week embargo.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   I don't know why the other reviewers
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.400]   decided to break their embargo a week ahead of time,
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.480]   but I made a promise.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.920]   - Everybody reviewed it last week before it came out.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.400]   You are still working on your review.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.080]   - Actually, truth be told, no,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.880]   I didn't get early hardware at this time.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.080]   - That's not all good. Oh, bad.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.280]   - I hope it's not your association with us
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.600]   because you know, Gruber got, no, seriously,
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.040]   all the fanboys, Gruber got one, MGC-Gler got one,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.640]   all the Apple fanboys got one.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.880]   You should have gotten one.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.560]   - I was thinking about writing a blog post on it.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.720]   Maybe I definitely should now.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.120]   Honestly, I could come up with a list of four people,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.280]   exactly four people in publications
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.520]   who absolutely must get advanced hardware
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.840]   from Apple in all situations.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.640]   And if any one of these four specific people
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.000]   in publications did not get advanced hardware,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.080]   I would say they did something wrong
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.040]   or there's some sort of weirdness
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.120]   with that relationship that caused that to change.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.320]   Everybody else beyond that, myself included,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.560]   it comes down to how many units is Apple 1F?
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.400]   - Okay.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   - And what do they hope to achieve with that?
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.480]   - You are so fair.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.320]   You're so fair.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.240]   - It's well, no, it's not entitlement.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.040]   Every time that Apple comes out with something brand new,
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.200]   there's a chance I'll get it early.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.080]   There's a chance I'll get it on the,
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.000]   if I don't get it early,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.520]   I'll almost certainly get it on the day of release.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.760]   - If, nonetheless, I don't count on getting stuff
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.840]   on the first day of the week.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.240]   - I used to when I was on tech TV,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.040]   I would take editorial loans when I worked in radio
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.200]   and take editorial loans from Apple.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.640]   I've always had a great relationship with them
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.880]   and they were always very forthcoming
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.200]   and not ahead of time usually.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.680]   And this was in the pre-secrecy, super-secrecy days.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.400]   And now I can afford to and I don't, in fact, take it.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.480]   So I've never asked for an editorial loan or an advanced loan.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.080]   But I presume the four you're talking about
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.200]   are New York Times, Wall Street Journal,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.760]   USA Today and Macworld.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.560]   I won't comment.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.120]   - Okay, but there are, I'm sure that you named several
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.960]   that would be on Macworld.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.360]   - Yeah, yeah, 'cause it'd be Mossberg, Pog, Snell, Big.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.200]   Ed Big.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.600]   - All right, so those would be the USA Today.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.800]   But I have to point out that as many people listen
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.520]   to this show every week as Subscribe to Macworld Magazine,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.280]   I'm sure your Chicago Sun Times reviews are read by
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.600]   at least as many people as those other journals.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.560]   - You're not that we're bitter.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.400]   - I'm not bitter.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.240]   In fact, I don't want it.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.120]   I'm not asking for it, but I have to say,
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.240]   it's a little weird when people like John Gruber
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.520]   and M.G. Seagler get advanced units
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.720]   and Andy and I code does not.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.640]   - It's not weird at all, again.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.480]   - Okay.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.120]   - You'd have to ask the people. - You're a bigger man than I.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.320]   - You'd have to ask the people at Apple what their goals were.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.280]   It's perfectly okay if that's not part of their goals.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.360]   - Well, I know what their goals are.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.320]   You see the fanboys.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.880]   - No, I'm not gonna comment on that.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.440]   The only thing that I wanna say before gracefully
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.520]   backing out of this discussion is that I don't,
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.040]   it's great if I get hardware early.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.360]   I love getting hardware early,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.280]   but I've never really wanted to be the guy
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.760]   who has the very first review.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.360]   I wanna have the one that ever wants to review.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.200]   - The good review.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.400]   - So that's why, I actually, I got mine on Friday.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.040]   I had a draft ready to go on Sunday nights.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.600]   I thought, okay, well, I missed the Wednesday,
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.000]   but I'll get the Monday traffic,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.880]   but I read it over and I realized that I don't really got it.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.560]   I gotta spend at least four or five days
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.800]   just intensively playing around with it before I feel as though
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.280]   I'll be able to really get it.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.400]   And I basically figured out a whole bunch of stuff
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.680]   with this that I didn't get before.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.920]   So there's really no need to,
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.520]   - I've got good man, Andy.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.600]   You're a bigger man than I.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.760]   That I will defend.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.600]   Good statement.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.200]   (laughing)
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.360]   Show title, we got a show title.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.720]   You're a bigger man than I am, Charlie Brown.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.040]   We're gonna take a break and come back.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.200]   We will get Andy's, is it fair to say your review
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.440]   are still first look at the iPad 2?
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.280]   - Oh no, review.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.120]   That's good.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.760]   I'm finishing up tonight, shooting some more videos.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.600]   It'll be in my editor's hands tomorrow
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.280]   and we'll be online probably Wednesday or Thursday
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.840]   in the printed edition on.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.920]   - I will give you my first look,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.200]   'cause I got one on Friday,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.600]   but I've only had a few days to play with it.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.040]   And we'll get a first look or review from Alex as well.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.000]   - I have a very short review.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.840]   I'll do it afterwards.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.200]   - I actually have a short review.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.400]   - I have the Twitter review.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   - Okay, 140 characters from Alex.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.800]   And we'll leave it at that.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.840]   Hey, before we do go on,
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.440]   and there's still lots more to talk about.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.640]   And I also would like to review the new MacBook Pro,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.600]   'cause I did get the 15-inch.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.040]   - I did one so bad.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   - You know how I justified it?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.400]   - Of course I wanted one,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.760]   but I bought one nine months ago.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.520]   I bought the i7 when it first came out
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.720]   and I wanted the Sandy Bridge.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.520]   But I have a new employee who also said I want an i7
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.240]   and I just conveniently didn't,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   oh, you meant last year's i7, right?
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.440]   So he's gonna get my old one.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.120]   And I still had to buy one in other words.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.520]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.320]   - So why shouldn't the newest one go to me?
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   - I get all of them and then that's definitely
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.480]   how that works for me.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.240]   You know, like I slow,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.640]   I get a new one like every six months.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.240]   - I will revive, no, I can't afford that.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.720]   That's ridiculous, $2,500.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.080]   But anyway, for $2,500.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   - For $2,500, everybody else in the company.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.800]   - I got the SSD, I got 8 gigs of RAM,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.000]   and I think I got the 2.33 gigahertz i7.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.120]   - Do you see the Lecidrive, the little big drive?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   - I can't wait to get that 700 megabyte gig.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.960]   We'll talk about that.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.800]   But I will give you my Twitter review of that.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.480]   Okay, there's a lot of Fs.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.320]   Lot of Fs in there.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.800]   It's an A plus, but I give it an F.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.600]   Like as in Fing, fantastic.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.800]   But that's, but that's.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.400]   (laughing)
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.240]   - You see what you did?
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.520]   You see what Leo did there?
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.720]   He did the turn around.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.960]   - I timed it around, I timed it around.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.480]   - We were going down and then suddenly
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.920]   he just pulled the stick up and we're
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.840]   - Fing, Fing, fantastic.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.280]   Time to talk about our friends at Citrix.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.080]   It was great to see the Citrix folks out
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.160]   at our live event on Sunday at Momos in Austin.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.400]   What a great time we had.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.840]   Hello to everybody, by the way, who was out there.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.240]   What a party that was.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.880]   Citrix announced it's new Go to My PC for the iPad,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.280]   which allows you to remotely access.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.200]   It's so weird to see a Windows computer on your iPad,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.680]   or a Mac on your iPad, but it works so well.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.520]   It's so cool.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.720]   And of course they've had Go to Meeting for the iPad
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.880]   for some time.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.720]   They support the iPad because they see,
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.160]   they're into the idea of making it easy for you
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.160]   to get your work done on the most portable hardware out there.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.040]   Go to Meeting is incredible.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.580]   We all have business travels.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.040]   We all need to meet with clients and colleagues,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.360]   but business travel is so expensive.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.880]   American Express says, and they should know,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.040]   'cause it's mostly charged on their cards.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.360]   The average business trip is $1,000, one trip.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.120]   I wish mine were $1,000.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.320]   I wish mine were $1,000.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.400]   Where are you staying?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.560]   (laughs)
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.840]   You know, when you add up hotel, airfare, and food,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.200]   that gets you to Muncie in back.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.040]   I don't know where you're sitting.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.440]   We were just sitting in a class with Go to Meeting
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.560]   on Saturday on Mac's moving.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.400]   For, you know, but we have people from all over the world.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.000]   And you use Go to Meeting to give classes?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.680]   And go to webinar.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.320]   We use Go to webinar, which is a bigger version of code.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.440]   So we had, we had 35 people,
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.720]   which is a little bit bigger than Go to Meeting,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.480]   but we have, but we had all people,
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.520]   the I'm sitting in Petaluma,
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.080]   the person who's actually hosting it was in London.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.440]   I mean, people from all over the world,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.080]   you know, watching it, watching his screen.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.760]   It's crystal clear, it's great audio.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.200]   People are able to, you know, ask questions.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.360]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.320]   I just, it's revolutionary.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.480]   It's amazing.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.320]   I want you to try it.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.800]   $49 a month, all the meetings you want.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.280]   There's no clock running.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.560]   There's no limit in the number of meetings.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.920]   It's basically unlimited use for $49 a month.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.680]   And by the way, but send, by the way,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.840]   $49 is one, what is that?
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   One-twentieth of the cost of a business trip.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.080]   Just pointing that out.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.560]   One business trip.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.400]   But, and by the way,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.520]   you get with that free voice conferencing,
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.000]   voice over IP and phone teleconferencing built in.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.520]   So we actually, we use Go to Meeting,
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.680]   we're not going to show something.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.600]   We just use Go to Meeting and set up the teleconferencing
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.760]   because then you've got the capability when,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.720]   if you want to, you don't have to fire it up,
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.480]   but if you want to show them something, there it is.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.040]   And you can have people on VoIP or on,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.240]   or you can have them calling in,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   so they can have a calling in.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.080]   So if it's not working,
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.400]   if they don't have the VoIP access,
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.760]   they can do that if they're driving in the car.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.000]   So you can have this kind of very heterogeneous mix of people
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.720]   that are all able to do whatever they need to do.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.040]   Exactly.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.280]   And on the iPad, you use the VoIP,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.320]   if you've got the speakers,
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.160]   but the thing is amazing.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   Sales presentations, product demos, collaboration,
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.880]   try it free for 30 days, do get that iPad app.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.920]   It's in the app store.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.120]   And then go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   and get the 30-day trial.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.960]   And you've got a month playing with Go to Meeting.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.080]   If you're just meeting with yourself,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.040]   it's kind of fun.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.080]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.080]   Well, it's not as much,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.480]   but it's actually might be more fun.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.560]   Go to meeting doc, meet with your girlfriend.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.680]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.880]   I'd like to have a meeting with you.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.520]   I would like, I have a business proposal for you.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.680]   It's a good meeting.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.520]   Go to meeting doc.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.320]   Do you think anybody's ever proposed marriage
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.800]   on Go to Meeting?
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.120]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.800]   That is a marriage that's gonna work great.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.280]   (laughing)
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.120]   You could have, you know,
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.040]   you could have fun with it.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.520]   If she says yes, you know that she's passed the test.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.480]   I'd like to do like make a keynote presentation
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.360]   of, you know, 15 reasons why you should marry me.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.320]   And then you go through it.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.800]   I'd like to make a presentation for you.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   And then you, wouldn't that,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.200]   that'd be so romantic.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.040]   Yes.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.840]   And a geeky sort of crazy thing.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.120]   I got a new product for Citrix.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.960]   Go to wedding.com.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.800]   Brilliant.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.960]   But until they have that,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.720]   go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   We thank you so much for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.080]   All right, Andy, you are thorough.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.480]   You are a professional trained journalist.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.080]   You know how to take something like the new iPad to,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.680]   how to hold it in your hands,
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.640]   how to, how to,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.960]   you're not like John C. Devorek
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.680]   who looks at the box and reviews it.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.560]   You actually take it out of the box and review it.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.760]   (laughing)
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.960]   Well, it's that small,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.280]   there's those little details that will really,
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.120]   really set the box.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.160]   He goes the extra mile.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.360]   He actually, sometimes I even charge it before I try it.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.800]   (laughing)
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.640]   Well, that's just crazy.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.600]   One thing I should point out is that it comes almost fully
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.120]   charged, which is really a nice thing.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.320]   So you don't, but the other thing I'd like to point out,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.680]   I got mine, you know,
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.920]   Eileen waited in line at the pop-up store in Austin.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.720]   They had us, it was just really cool.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.240]   Only sold iPads.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.920]   And she brought it to me.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.520]   I was so excited, it was at the Citrix breakfast actually.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.480]   I turned on and it said connect to iTunes and I thought,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.800]   oh, I can't use it till I get back to my room.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.280]   So you still have to connect it to a computer.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.120]   We are not completely in the post-PC era.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.600]   It's still, it's not a paperless office quite yet, no.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.400]   I guess the store would activate it if you ask them, but.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.680]   - Oh, I don't know if they do that,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   'cause remember that it has,
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.960]   linking to your desktop also gives you back up,
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.880]   so it also gives you your connection to the iTunes store.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.200]   - But you couldn't say to them,
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.600]   look, I don't have a computer and I still want an iPad?
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.440]   - I do not know, I should probably find that out.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.880]   - That's an interesting thing.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.320]   My guess would be no, because you certainly wouldn't want the,
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.160]   yeah.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.000]   - I believe they will activate it.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.840]   - I'll update it.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.400]   - But they probably would do something like say,
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.920]   well, dude, you know you're not gonna be able to back it up.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.200]   You know, because you can buy apps directly on the iPad,
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.920]   you can get music on the iPad, but.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.880]   - I think they will activate.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.680]   Yeah, the chat room saying they will activate it.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   - And also, and also one of the parts of my sort of insights
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.480]   as I've been playing for the past few days is that Apple
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.440]   has started, Apple has really turned an interesting corner
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.560]   on the iPad in that they weren't complete,
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.160]   I don't think they were completely sure about how people
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.520]   would relate to it after they released it,
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.920]   and they were ready to open up one of three different envelopes
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.520]   after the end of six months to decide
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.480]   what path are we gonna take with this?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.680]   And they decided to go really gutsy and say,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.080]   this is not an accessory to another computer.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.240]   This is a computer in and of itself,
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.960]   and it's a destination computer.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.440]   We want you to think about doing movies on it.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.800]   We want you to think about using all your presentations,
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.200]   all your work processing off it.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.880]   We also wanna make sure that no matter what you wanna hook it up to
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.080]   and use it with, you'll be able to use it with that.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.440]   So this is, I think Apple, if you thought that Apple was
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.920]   pretty strong about the iPad in 2010, I think in 2011,
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.680]   you're gonna see them being even more aggressive.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.960]   They're gonna, I think they stopped going after the netbooks
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.440]   and then this year they're gonna start going after notebooks
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.800]   with the iPad.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.760]   - I understandably so, I mean, that was clear
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   in Steve's presentation when he said post-PC era.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.280]   - He said, he basically declared victory.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.120]   He said, well, unfortunately, it's,
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.920]   what's that old statement?
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.520]   - It's not bragging if it's actually true.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.360]   - Right.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.320]   - It's, no, all the competition got completely
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.960]   papered with this.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.640]   There's, I was trying to, twice now,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.160]   I've tried to figure out how to write pieces
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.760]   about the iPad II in which it doesn't sound as though
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.280]   I have totally drunk Apple's Kool-Aid
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.120]   about, at least on the iPad's front.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.600]   There is, I've written, I wrote a piece
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.880]   that was published on yesterday, I believe,
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.440]   that was just talking about, oh, here is the,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.560]   here's the state of tablets,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.360]   here's which iPad you might hear,
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.640]   here are all the feet, if you're thinking about
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.080]   getting an iPad in about three months
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.160]   when there's more to purchase, here's the model to buy,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.960]   here's what's coming out from other manufacturers
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.880]   in the next year, and there was just,
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   there's just nothing coming out in 2011
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.760]   that is going to be in any way competitive with the iPad.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.880]   If you're talking about something that looks like this
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.040]   and fills the exact same role of an iPad,
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.800]   there is nothing on the market
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.720]   that even merits basic consideration.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.280]   - No, no, he's in that premature to say that.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.440]   I mean, no, it isn't.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.160]   - You haven't seen the playbook.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.960]   - I have seen him use the playbook.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.400]   - Why are you laughing?
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.600]   You don't think it's even possible
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.120]   that Blackberry could compete.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.960]   - No.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.800]   - Okay.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.640]   - No, actually, actually.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.600]   - It's not like Stinks, it's absurd to even
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.400]   - It's say that the technical term is preposterous.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.240]   - Okay, and the Zoom,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.480]   - And you have a Zoom, I presume.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   - Here's the problem is I've had,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.800]   I've had a bunch of Blackberry like touchable,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.200]   like screen, you know, screen type phones,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.880]   and they were so far from usable
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.080]   that it kind of exited my, even my reality.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.920]   - And that's, that's what I--
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.200]   - So Zoom, no.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.680]   - Wait, wait, let's go, let's go back to the playbook.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.600]   Now, I actually call that one out as,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.880]   if there's any one tablet that's not made by Apple
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.040]   that I'm optimistic or interested or slash optimistic about,
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.800]   it is the playbook because it's the one tablet
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.840]   coming out in 2011 where it's clear
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.640]   that they're not trying to make an iPad.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.600]   They're trying to make something different.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.080]   I think one of the smartest things that Blackberry did
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.800]   was listen very, very carefully
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.160]   when Steve Jobs railed about,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.200]   oh, seven-inch tablets are stupid.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.040]   There's no way it can possibly work.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.440]   They're gonna die, die, die, die, die.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.160]   And Blackberry, they said, okay,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.480]   so Apple is definitely not gonna make a seven-inch,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.000]   nope, seven-inch tablet.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.840]   Let's make ourselves a really good seven-inch notebook,
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.520]   tablet, and I only had about a half hour of time
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.320]   with a working playbook so far, but I like what I saw it.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.160]   - I did too. - If it could sell it.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.120]   - I thought it was quite impressive.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.160]   It multi-test beautifully.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.240]   Where they're gonna have problems
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.720]   is what Steve Jobs pointed out already with Honeycomb,
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.600]   is that there is the app ecosystem.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.440]   I mean, it's--
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.000]   - Not people, it's not Honeycomb.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.920]   They're doing-- - No, I know it's not Honeycuz,
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.560]   QNix, but I'm saying that that's the same,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.520]   Steve said there's only 35 apps or whatever.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.280]   He said 10 apps for Honeycomb.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.880]   It's even worse for Blackberry.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.440]   - They said 100, but here's the difference.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.120]   I'm not convinced that you need to have a million apps available
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.880]   for a million apps to make it work.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.360]   I do think that if you have a decent tablet
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.560]   that fits a certain role that works well and is priced right,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.920]   if you have the right 10 apps for it,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.640]   including the Kindle app and Amazon
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.880]   will build Kindle app for it.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.120]   If you come out with a new wristwatch
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.680]   and you ask Kindle, Amazon to please make a Kindle app for it,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.960]   they'll make you a wristwatch based version of Kindle app.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.280]   A good office suite, good web browser,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.640]   make sure the email is good enough
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.160]   that you can rely on it all day long.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.480]   - That's a question mark with a playbook
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.240]   because it doesn't come with an email app,
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.000]   which is very strange.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   - Well, we'll find that out.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.440]   It's, unfortunately, asked with all of these tablets,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.640]   the biggest damage is that they're not willing to tell us
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.240]   in advance how much these things cost.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.960]   - That's 'cause they can't get anywhere near the price.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.120]   - That's an interesting issue.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.440]   - They couldn't do it, the Zoom, they couldn't do it, right?
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.760]   But it is a faster system.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.680]   - Well, now they're better components, right?
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.400]   - But the test, no, the test with the iPhone,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.080]   I say it's not faster.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.680]   - Yeah, iPad with the Zoom.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.840]   We're talking about the Zoom
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.600]   being more expensive than the iPad 2
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.120]   because it has higher quality components.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.040]   - But it's not as fast as the iPad 2.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.880]   - It doesn't.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.320]   - What components are better?
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.160]   - Camera?
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.080]   - I spent-- - The playbook camera
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.120]   is definitely better, we know that.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.560]   - Guys, I did spend Sunday doing side-by-side
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.400]   photo shootouts and I don't think--
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.480]   - No, I agree.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.120]   - It reinforces the idea that the iPad 2 camera
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   is kind of awful, but every, I compared it
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.240]   against the Zoom camera, against the Samsung Galaxy tab camera,
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.320]   they're all really designed for video
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.040]   and not for still pictures, so you're not gonna get
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.640]   a good camera and a tablet right now.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.040]   - Yeah, actually, Macworld, I think,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.160]   did a side-by-side comparison also of the pictures.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.680]   Galaxy tab, iPad 2, Motorola Zoom,
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.560]   they agreed with you that the,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.160]   unfortunately, the camera, the still camera
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.320]   in the iPad wasn't so good.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.160]   - But that's okay, yeah.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.080]   - The Zoom wasn't as good as the iPad 4.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.640]   They didn't have a BlackBerry, of course, to test, so.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.040]   - I think it's premature to say
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.120]   there won't be anything in 2011 that's as good.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.040]   I don't know how you can say that, Andy.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.960]   - I've, because there are five different manufacturers
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.280]   who have announced an intention
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.480]   to enter into this market.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.600]   I have now seen all five of their pieces of hardware.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.200]   None of them have been able to add an innovation
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.880]   that can exceed the iPad 2 in 2011.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.680]   There is no feature that they have in their device
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.480]   that the iPad does not have.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.720]   They will not be able to get anywhere near the depth
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.800]   and the quality of the apps that are there.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.960]   Also, none of these devices I have seen
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.680]   have anything close to, anywhere as close to,
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   as integrated and as coherent as the experience
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.040]   you have on the iPad.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.640]   Android 3.0, it's a big leap forward.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.880]   And when I reviewed the Zoom a few weeks ago,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.400]   I did say that it's the first tablet I've seen
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.160]   that's actually in the iPad's class.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.760]   If you want to use something,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.960]   if you need something that does the job of an iPad,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.800]   the Zoom can do it.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.000]   It just won't do it quite as well.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.840]   But you still don't,
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.720]   you still have an incredibly clumsy
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.400]   and inconsistent experience from app to app to app.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.080]   That's why I think that 2012 will be very interesting
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.800]   because each one of these companies
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.080]   that's competing with the iPad
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   will have extra components in place.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.560]   HP, for instance, has announced that
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.080]   they're really going all in on WebOS.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.720]   It's going to be their phone OS,
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.240]   it's going to be their tablet OS.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.760]   Yeah, I thought that was also,
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.080]   we'll also ship on all the desktops and all of them.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.560]   I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.520]   So WebOS is going to be an interesting player as well.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.800]   So that's, again, that's an example of
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.680]   don't try to make another iPad.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.120]   Try to make your own thing.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.520]   So, there's so many great reasons to buy an HP desktop
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.000]   or an HP notebook anyway.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So you need to buy yourself a brand new I-21 Core processor
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.440]   upgrade to your notebook in 2012.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.960]   In late 2012, early 2013,
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.080]   now you're finally in a mindset
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.800]   where you really want to buy a 10 inch tablet.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.600]   You've got the iPad, which is wonderful.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.360]   Then you've got this HP tablet,
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   which will act as a completely transparent,
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.560]   I'm speculating here.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.160]   Please, really, I'm speculating.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.640]   But now you have, on the other hand,
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.920]   you have this other tablet that is designed to be
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.280]   absolutely intimately related to everything that you do
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.560]   on your HP where it will automatically find your HP
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.080]   computer no matter where it is,
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.600]   run the exact same apps in the exact same way
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.960]   with the exact same data.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.760]   This will just be a projected version
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.200]   of everything you've got in your desktop.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.720]   That suddenly makes it an interesting buying decision
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.680]   when you've got these two tablets side by side.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.720]   But that's not going to happen until 2012.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.240]   In 2011, I don't see any competition.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.160]   And of course, I did realize how far I was sticking my neck out
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.800]   by saying something that dramatic.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.400]   And believe me, that's one of those things
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.520]   where I type something and I keep looking at it
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.080]   and I focus on it every time I look at that draft.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.600]   But in the end, if I truly believe that
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.120]   and I truly believe I can defend that, I have to say it.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.080]   So if there's something else in November,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.440]   the first line will be, I was wrong, I was wrong,
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.760]   I was wrong, I was wrong.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.920]   The new Lombata Wear Disco Pad 21.12.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.280]   It's the most awesome thing ever.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.320]   I can't just throw it in my eye.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.840]   So let's then maybe qualify what you said.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.640]   In my crystal ball, from what I can see so far,
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.320]   there's nothing even on the horizon that's--
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.120]   But don't we--
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.280]   TES is usually where people are blowing their water.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.880]   That's when they're showing us that this is what we're
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.720]   going to do this year.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.200]   When we didn't see anything at CES, no, I agree with you on that.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.160]   You know, they wouldn't let me touch the zoom.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.400]   I mean, they'll always touch the zoom now.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.560]   Yeah, but I'm saying--
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.920]   But that's like it was so early on.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.280]   So some's doing a 10-inch with Honeycomb.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.960]   I liked the Galaxy Tab a lot.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.440]   I would say it was close--
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.240]   I would consider perhaps closer to the iPad 2 than you did,
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.520]   Andy.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.480]   But I agree with you that there's nothing
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.440]   in the class of iPad 2, even the Galaxy Tab, which I think
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.760]   is a very good product.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.040]   I still feel like this is the iPod version 2, where you--
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.000]   everyone's scrambling.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.600]   The iPod made this huge impact.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.360]   And then everyone scrambled.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.400]   And then it got too far ahead.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.320]   And then everyone just kind of gave up, moved on.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.640]   Well, Apple didn't advance.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.800]   Now, this would be my thumbnail review
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.040]   to interrupt yours briefly.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.280]   And then we'll get back to Andy.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.720]   Apple didn't advance the game that far.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.600]   They kind of advanced them minimally far.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.360]   It's thinner.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.400]   It's a little lighter.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.640]   It's got a camera, not a great camera.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.400]   It's faster.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.360]   But until we see apps that take advantage of it,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.880]   it's not particularly noticeably faster.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.120]   Oh, it is way faster.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.680]   In every app, I don't see that.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.960]   I must have single threaded, so I don't think I would expect that.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.560]   No, it doesn't.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.840]   It's so hard to find a benchmark that's real-world.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.200]   My benchmark was actually--
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.880]   the best solution that I could come up with was auto-stitch.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.160]   And I decided that I'm going to--
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.400]   because it's an iPhone app.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.120]   You can see that I'm running it actually just in--
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.240]   it's an iPhone app.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.040]   Where I just took a 23-shot panorama and decided
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.400]   that I'm going to calculate how long it takes for the iPad
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.000]   to build that panorama and how long it takes for the iPad 1.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.320]   That's a fair comparison.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.120]   And the iPad 2 got it 2.2 times faster than the original.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.080]   Everything works faster.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.400]   Now, you're right in that a lot of different applications
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.600]   are going to be tuned for it.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.960]   I have a list right now that Apple provided me
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.200]   of apps that they know for a fact
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.040]   have been optimized specifically for the iPad 2.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.200]   The biggest games are--
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.520]   as far as I know so far-- and I'm still
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.160]   trying to talk to the actual developers of these games--
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   what they have-- they haven't actually
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.720]   made processor-specific enhancements.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.000]   They've simply said there is so much better performance
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.720]   in this chip that all we have--
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.080]   you know how we decided that we're not going to have this really,
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.360]   really higher density texture map for the crowd scenes
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.640]   and the glints off the armor and the weapons,
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.960]   because the iPad 1 processor is going to handle it.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.080]   Let's just upgrade all of those textures,
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.840]   because now we know that the graphics processor and the CPU
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.720]   can definitely handle it.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.000]   That's why you don't necessarily see, or my experience.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.360]   You don't necessarily see greater frame rates.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.240]   But you do see that every single object is greater detailed,
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.120]   because-- and not because they optimized it for the processor,
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.280]   because they simply replaced the game elements with ones
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.640]   that would take a lot more time to render properly.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.000]   The two places that I noticed it the most
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.400]   was in GarageBand and also in the daily--
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.080]   you know, the Rupert Martux.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.560]   You know, the daily--
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   The daily was like--
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.560]   You're actually still reading that?
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.920]   It's pretty awful.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.560]   You still have the free subscription, I hope.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.920]   You're not playing with it.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.520]   You're paying for that.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.920]   I have friends that work there.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.160]   Well, it's wonderful then.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.560]   I just love it.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.320]   But my brother shot-- there was a-- they did a thing on Rango.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.160]   And my brother actually shot the interviews.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.280]   I mean, he shot the videofloyl.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:43.640]   Oh, all right.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.520]   Well, then I like them.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.200]   I see the daily is keeping--
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.960]   Great people like your brother, gainfully employed.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.040]   Exactly.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.400]   So when it came out, it was really clunky.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.480]   You know, on the iPad 1, when you start moving stuff,
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.400]   everything doesn't really want to move very well.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.160]   And everything else.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.280]   And on the iPad 2, suddenly it was like, boom,
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.400]   it really made a difference.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   The other one, though, is GarageBand.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.080]   On the iPad 1, it's constantly re-optimizing.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.600]   And on the iPad 2, it's just--
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.640]   They never really wanted you to run GarageBand.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.480]   I mean, you can run GarageBand on the iPad 1,
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.400]   but it's clearly positioned for the iPad 2.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.200]   My son still enjoys it on the iPad 1.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.920]   But is it the multi-- is it multi-instruments
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.760]   that I had hard times?
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.680]   It's actually any individual instrument seems to work fine.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.760]   It's when you add--
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.600]   it's when you start layering them.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.840]   That's a multiple tracks.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.120]   Yeah, when you start adding multiple tracks,
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.320]   it starts to get ugly.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.600]   I have to say, this--
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.560]   yeah, I could see how this would really challenge
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.720]   the GPU and the processor and what it's doing.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.040]   You played with smart keyboard, right?
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.760]   Small keyboard.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   I mean, just-- the smart instruments
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.520]   are really what's most interesting to play with.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.960]   This is a spectacular program.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.320]   This by itself should sell a lot of iPad 2.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.120]   So I showed that to my wife.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.000]   And she literally, within a minute
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.520]   of looking at GarageBand, she was like, I need one.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.040]   Done.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.560]   I need one.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.040]   When do I get one?
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.960]   I said, well, there now.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.280]   I should have bought two.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.520]   What was I thinking?
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.320]   It's all I got to say.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.080]   Now I have to wait weeks.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.000]   With her still on my iPad.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.960]   So what else, Andy?
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.880]   Give us some more of your thumbnail review.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.560]   Mostly, it's hard to really appreciate exactly how much
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:26.880]   thinner this actually is compared to the previous one.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.640]   I have to make a certain point kind of delicately.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.280]   I want to do a personal note to Apple.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.080]   I love it that it's that much thinner.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.760]   It's incredible that this is actually a multi-core, really,
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.000]   really incredibly powerful computer.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.960]   Please don't make it any thinner than this.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.240]   I think that they found exactly how thin they can make this
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.040]   without making it a little bit harder to use.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.560]   I kind of wished--
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.040]   I started using it without the cover attached.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.240]   And I kind of wished that the back were a little bit grippier
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.800]   because when it's this thin, there
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.040]   is no hard edge of any kind to sort of settle
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   into a crook.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.800]   I could sort of sense myself being stupid at some point,
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.440]   trying to put this inside my bag and my finger slipping on it
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.080]   and actually dropping it.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.240]   But balanced against that is this cover is you cannot--
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.120]   I have to sort of reel back a lot of my enthusiasm
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.760]   about certain things about looking
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.680]   like a stupid Apple fanboy.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.360]   But this cover, only Apple, I think,
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.400]   could put this much thought into something
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.160]   as simple as a protective cover.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.560]   Because you've probably seen how it has a cool thing where
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.400]   it automatically wake itself and sleep itself.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.280]   Look how fast it does that.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.520]   That's how fast.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.040]   You don't have to unlock it or anything.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.000]   You open it, and as though it was never
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.400]   a sleep to begin with.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.280]   You've seen the other two modes where
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.880]   you can set it up as a typing easel or as a stand easel.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.760]   But then, as I'm sort of playing with this,
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.960]   I'm thinking, dang it.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.640]   It's kind of hard to hold it and read.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.920]   I realize that you can accordion fold it.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.040]   And this is the most comfortable thing in the world
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.640]   to hold on to and read with.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.720]   I was at a diner-- having breakfast at a diner this morning,
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.600]   holding it like a newspaper while I'm having my pancakes.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.320]   And it's the most comfortable thing in the world to hold on to.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.720]   It feels-- you feel as though, yes, this thing costs me 500 bucks.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.680]   But man, did Apple really want to earn every penny of my money
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.160]   in this design?
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.840]   I fix it to tear down, of course, not only the iPad.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   They tore down the cover.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.040]   But I love--
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]   I love it.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.240]   You think-- what's the easiest thing you could possibly do?
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.760]   Well, of course, the slick thing we're going to do
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.240]   is we're going to put a magnet in it.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.520]   But it's designed so that it's almost-- you
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.960]   have to work to get this to go on the wrong way.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.320]   There's-- I think they said there's something
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.640]   like 30 different magnets inside here.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.280]   All designs so that--
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.440]   it's all designs so that-- look at that.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.040]   All designs so that when it attaches, it will grab.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.440]   It also will align itself perfectly.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:00.040]   If you don't have a cable trying to pull it down,
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.960]   you wouldn't want to try to lift it up by the cover,
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.720]   but you can.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.240]   It can actually support the weight of the iPad.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.000]   It's just a marvelous part of the design.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.040]   Apple told me that this was--
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.920]   it was developed completely concurrently with the iPad,
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.840]   too, meaning from the very first stroke of a whiteboard
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.360]   pen and a whiteboard, it was being designed
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.000]   so that the iPad could work with it,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   and this would work with the iPad.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Do you recommend this?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.680]   I guess everybody's getting the smart cover.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.640]   I got the smart cover.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.560]   I recommend it pretty highly.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.040]   You're still going to want a case, though,
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.120]   because it doesn't protect anything on the pad itself.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.760]   It doesn't-- well, it's kind of thick,
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.160]   so it protects the front pretty well.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.640]   It doesn't protect the back.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.280]   But there's-- unless you're worried about scratches,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.880]   and that's something to be concerned about,
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.960]   if you're concerned about selling it on,
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.720]   I also noticed that carrying around in my bag
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.320]   for three or four days, it is possible once you toss it
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.120]   inside a bag--
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.280]   You've got to be careful there.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.200]   --for the cover to get dislodged like that.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.720]   That's the only disappointment that I had
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.960]   associated with the cover.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.560]   But the good news is that I didn't think
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.000]   to bring a magnet with me.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.160]   But the sensor for the cover is just a magnet
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.200]   that's right here in the middle here.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.120]   So if you take a kitchen magnet and just blow--
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.040]   It's working.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:10.960]   Sorry.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   Rock and roll, baby!
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:18.360]   It is amazing how it just kind of knows where to attach.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.560]   It always attaches properly.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.680]   And so this is something that--
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.200]   It's magical.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.240]   --Blackberry had in the holster for a long time.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.640]   And if people are worried about the idea of a magnet,
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.800]   this little minor magnet's not going to do anything.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.360]   It didn't do anything to the Blackberry.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.400]   All those-- I'm sorry.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.800]   All I was going to say on that point
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   is that any manufacturer that puts a magnet in that right
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.840]   position can take advantage of the smart cover feature.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.320]   So we can have a bigger case that has a hole for the camera,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.480]   which is the reason the current cases don't work.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.720]   And it's smart enough to have that sensing built into the front.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   Right.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.320]   Scoti is doing an iPad version of my favorite iPad case,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.920]   the full I/O.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.400]   The clam case is making an iPad 2 version of their Bluetooth
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.080]   keyboard.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.320]   Everybody's retooling to make sure they can support the iPad.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.400]   You just don't work good.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.280]   So I was kind of-- when I first saw it a week ago,
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.440]   I thought, oh, did Apple figure out a way to make sure
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.480]   that they would have-- that people would have to buy a license
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.280]   to get the smart cover sort of magnets working?
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.400]   And that was a question that I can't get a specific--
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.800]   I can't get a specific answer as to whether Apple has produced
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.320]   a specification.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.320]   I don't know about that yet.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.280]   But I do know that really, if you take your Wallace and Gromit
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.240]   fridge magnet off of your fridge and put it on top of that sensor
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.880]   and take it away, it does the exact same thing.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.240]   So I think pretty much everybody who designs cases and covers
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.360]   are going to build in that kind of function.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.200]   I fix it, actually.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.040]   It's been a great source.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.840]   They actually use a razor to cut apart.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.040]   They've been a great source also on the teardown of the--
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.360]   they immediately get one of these things,
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.520]   and they tear it down on the iPad 2.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:53.760]   They have identified now that A5 is made-- is fabbed by Samsung.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.080]   And I believe I've seen a number of benchmarks, perhaps
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.960]   from Macworld, that say it's probably an A9 dual core,
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.880]   A9, not an A8 is a non in others thought.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.600]   The GPU, they also found the GPU chip,
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.080]   and I don't have the number in front of me.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.120]   It's a long number, but obviously a very capable GPU.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.360]   So we know a little bit more about the guts of it.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.040]   Seems like the speakers aren't as good, Andy.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.800]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.440]   There's a lot less base involved.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.040]   I think that's part of the fact that--
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.920]   part of the fact that this is so thin.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.560]   There was actually a little bump on the back
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.920]   of the original iPad, I think, was a nice little resonance
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.760]   chamber, too.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.960]   I do notice a difference.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.920]   I can't find a way to really qualify that, except saying,
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.240]   it sounds like you're not going to be sure this--
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.400]   Well, and what you're going to want to do
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.520]   is use a speaker of some kind, like this,
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.160]   fourth, if you're going to use GarageBand,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.080]   you're going to not want to listen to GarageBand
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.680]   through that little tinny speaker.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.880]   You're going to want to have a better speaker.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.280]   Actually, this will be my pick a little later on.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.080]   I'll show you a Bluetooth speaker that's really great with this.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.120]   Nice.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.960]   Do you notice that it's a little less comfortable
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.800]   putting the sync cable in?
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.320]   Like with this--
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.560]   Yes, it's impossible.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   What the hell is this story in there?
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   It takes a little bit more work.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.120]   I feel like it's going to break it.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.280]   Yeah, me too.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.000]   What's that all about?
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.560]   I don't think it's quite that bad.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.800]   There's also-- but we didn't even mention it--
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.240]   as if you look at the headphone jack, which is the--
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.560]   unfortunately, there's no squared off edge anywhere.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.920]   So it's not as though it's difficult to put in,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.840]   but it's not quite as natural.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.360]   One of the things that has got me curious about freecher
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.240]   designs is that you've got to know that at some--
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.040]   there's some office somewhere in Apple where some engineer
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.680]   is saying, if only we could come up with a new version
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.520]   of a headphone jack that would be flat instead of round,
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.280]   we could shave another two millimeters off
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.240]   the thinness of this or we wouldn't
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.760]   have to worry about what kind of curve
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.600]   we put on the side of it.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.080]   We could make this come to a sharper edge if we wanted to.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.640]   They're definitely coming to a lot of different design
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.480]   limits when you start making something this powerful.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.240]   That has to do this many things and make it this thin.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.840]   The thing that popped up for me was that it was just like,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.880]   "Rr, I can't-- I just keep on feeling
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.920]   like I have to think about it.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.040]   With my older iPad, I was able to just kind of pop it on."
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.760]   And I agree with you that--
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.320]   Oh, oh, Leo was in the house.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.560]   I'm in the house.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.680]   It's club-back break.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.680]   But it does make it--
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.480]   That's pretty quick.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.320]   Yeah, here, a good-- I mean, this is the garage band--
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:22.840]   I love this.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.960]   This is their look.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.840]   You get it, roll the dice.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.840]   You get it.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.680]   That's just too much fun.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.720]   But you're hearing some good bass coming out
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.480]   of that smart drum.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.920]   I mean, there's no question.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.480]   Here's the smart bass.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.000]   There's no question that--
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.920]   You hit the very top tabs, too.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.880]   Well--
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.520]   That's the live-apoo bass.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.840]   In the guitar, you can--
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.280]   Aprite?
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   You hit the--
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.320]   Tabs, it'll play the chord.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.000]   It'll play the chords.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   That's a pretty good bass.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.240]   Gosh, this is fun.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.080]   They don't do the side.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.240]   They should have been playing the sides.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.640]   And they got the sequences, the little dials
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.280]   on the upper right.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.080]   Right.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:49:59.360]   Right.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.120]   These things.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.680]   I turned off autoplay, but let's turn it on here.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:09.520]   I don't even know what I'm doing,
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.080]   and it sounds like something.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.360]   Let's turn on notes.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.360]   Look at the bending.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.920]   Andy's doing it, too, now, right?
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.560]   You choose this.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.520]   I mean, this is an amazing--
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.880]   This program, you're right, should sell the freaking thing.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.240]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.680]   I know that they did this because it's just a good idea
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.600]   to do this.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.840]   But--
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.200]   Well, you have to remember that they have--
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.840]   At some point, there's a certain amount of arrogance saying,
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.160]   Oh, you think that you're making a tablet?
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.720]   Oh, it's so adorable that you think that you've--
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.760]   I'll tell you about you.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.280]   Here's a music app.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:43.960]   I'll tell you what.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.440]   We'll spot you 90%.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:45.920]   Tell you what.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.640]   How about just a four key keyboard that just--
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.680]   Nothing but play notes.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.640]   If you could do something that works even half as well as this,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   we will give you 80 million notes.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.120]   Here's the other challenge is that
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.880]   is that Apple is sitting on the technology
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.680]   that they have with Final Cut, with the former technologies
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.040]   of Shake and Chalice, when it comes to iMovie.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.280]   Well, did you see that somebody benchmarked iMovie
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.480]   on the iPad 2 versus a Mac Pro?
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.000]   And the iPad 2 is actually faster at some things?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.600]   I mean, this is--
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.680]   Yeah, I mean, it's--
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.760]   And this is all technology that they can go in from logic
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.640]   and a lot of the other stuff that they purchased in the past.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.800]   So they have access to all of this technology.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.880]   And I don't think that these developers are told,
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.120]   oh, keep that in the Pro area.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.480]   You know, they're like, if you'd like to go over to the library
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.520]   of our code, just go over and find something and optimize it.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.880]   Yeah, it's just--
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.000]   I mean, I just think the garage band app,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.360]   like I was testing out last night by just--
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.560]   I can only barely play this thing.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.120]   That's the way I play.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.440]   But, you know, so I played my little song
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:50.160]   and then just spent the next, like, two hours just having fun.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.800]   Say, well, I can't play keyboard really well.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.960]   But hey, look, I know what the chords are to this song
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.520]   I just played.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.840]   So I'll just have it go.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.800]   - All this how the P is goes C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   - C, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.940]   - Yeah, it sounds great!
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.280]   - It was like, "My God! It looks like actually
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.600]   "no, I don't think what I'm doing!"
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.340]   (laughs)
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.440]   - See, just that.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.500]   How it's doing like, the bending, of course,
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:11.760]   like I'm kind of going-- - Is that amazing?
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.080]   Time.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.900]   - It's like...
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.080]   - And it hits some of the pedals, it's--
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.960]   - Yeah. - Awesome.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.380]   I like the roller flanger.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.120]   - And it's responding to touch so quickly
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.140]   and so responsibly that you can do this in real time.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.440]   - Yeah, that's where you're seeing.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.240]   That's gotta be the CPU, right?
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.080]   - Yeah.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.720]   - Tap a button, tap a button and make it feel as though
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.200]   I'm tapping the real button.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.040]   - Right. - Right.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.880]   - Right.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.880]   - So it's an impressive, an impressive,
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.000]   in many ways impressive product.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.840]   - An impressive product.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.640]   - Yeah, that would be the--
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.640]   - That would be the--
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.800]   - Is that your Twitter review?
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.200]   - No, my Twitter review was, it's faster with cameras.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.040]   - Yeah.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.640]   - I didn't get any-- - You left out thinner.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.480]   - I don't really care about the thinner.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.600]   - Little thinner. - People ask like,
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.440]   "What's the big difference?"
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.560]   I'm like, "It's faster with cameras."
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.260]   So if you want, if you felt like things are dragging--
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.160]   - Add cameras.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.780]   No, I gotta complain a little bit about the still cameras.
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:00.620]   It's crap. - Yeah.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.540]   - I don't care about the still camera.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.980]   - I mean, I think that's 'cause of the thickness
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.820]   that they couldn't get a better camera in there.
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.820]   - Ah, I just think, I think it was price.
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.940]   I mean, I think that their Apple is very focused
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.660]   on making sure that the price doesn't change,
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.500]   that they can-- - I think they put that
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.660]   in the iPhone. - I know.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.500]   - I know, but their iPad is--
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.140]   - Wouldn't if you liked the iPhone 4 camera sensor--
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.500]   - Oh, I absolutely, and I--
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.420]   - And it's an impressive thing.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.500]   - And I tweeted, I tweeted that.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.060]   There's no reason that they shouldn't have put it in.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   - I really think-- - No, I think it's a signature
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.700]   Apple move where they decided,
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.560]   is it realistic for anybody to be using a tablet
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   to take still pictures with?
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.160]   No, then it's not, then, then--
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.500]   - And why is it not important to us
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.500]   that we put in a great camera?
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.660]   - I think the next one will have a great camera.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.160]   - It is important that, that, excuse me,
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.580]   it is important that FaceTime cameras
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.020]   and video cameras work okay.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.860]   - Right. - And if you notice,
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.960]   the focal length of the lens on the iPhone,
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.580]   it's about this wide, on the iPad, it's kinda like this
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.060]   because it is definitely optimized towards
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:58.140]   having a picture of you and the kid
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.060]   and showing it to grandpa.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.380]   So it's not a wide screen sort of effect.
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.700]   I think on that basis, you have to note that
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.860]   it's not a great camera, but I can't fault Apple for it
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.020]   because they never really said that,
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.700]   this is a great camera, you're gonna love shooting things
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.940]   at 320 by 240, 300--
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.660]   - Right, well, but I think that the thing is,
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.020]   is that you, I think if people got used to taking photos,
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.180]   I mean, I think it sounds odd that you take photos with this,
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.300]   but I think if you started taking photos of them,
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.860]   having that full screen is a lot of fun
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.860]   to take pictures and video and everything else.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.700]   - I agree, and I'm looking at it now,
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.020]   the one thing they seem to, it's odd,
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.340]   but my sense of this, and I think a non-detect
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.380]   reported this is that while it's a bad still camera,
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.300]   it's a, it's 920 by 760, or I'm sorry, 960 by 720,
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.860]   still camera, it actually does go to 1280 by 720
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.260]   when it's going to video mode.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.380]   It seems to change to a full 18 camera,
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.540]   and it's back Mac world said it's better than the FlipHD.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.260]   - It's a, what it's doing, I mean, I think--
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.340]   - Is it scaling, or is it just--
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.340]   - It's typically what it's doing,
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.900]   is it's doing basically a non-square.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:00.260]   So what it's doing is it's capturing 960 by 720,
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.620]   and then popping it back open.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.660]   Now that's not an uncommon thing,
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.220]   a lot of the Panasonic cameras do that,
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.620]   the Flip may be doing that, you know,
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.300]   there's a lot of things that do that,
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.140]   it's a little bit of a cheat,
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.980]   it just makes it everything just a little bit softer
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.340]   than it needs to be, but you know, it's fine.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.900]   - Have you done tests on the quality of the--
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.020]   - I haven't tested it against charts yet,
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.020]   so we're going to be doing that.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.780]   - Mac world does have some stuff,
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.700]   and they actually report that it is pretty good.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.540]   Pretty good.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.220]   - Yeah, but I find that there's only one major misstep
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.660]   in the whole device that I've really seen,
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.860]   is that I think it's kind of odd that,
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.820]   when they transfer the camera app over to the iPad,
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.540]   they decided to put the shutter button
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.340]   the same place it is on the iPhone,
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.500]   which means that when you're trying to hold up,
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.140]   you're, hold up the iPad like this,
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.260]   if you look in the center there,
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.260]   it's kind of hard for your thumb to get exactly right there.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.600]   When you're holding it vertically like this,
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.660]   that's kind of a big problem,
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.580]   because the only way to, it's really hard to get,
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.540]   you really would have wished that they put it
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:57.580]   right here on the side,
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.020]   where you would naturally hold it.
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.000]   - I agree.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.100]   - This is, again, a $500 to $800 device
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.780]   that is very, very thin,
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.420]   and it's not very grippy on the back.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.500]   I really wanted, or I really would have wanted them
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.780]   to put a trigger there so I can hold it
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.360]   as securely as possible,
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.680]   while I'm trying to take this picture.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.660]   - I have to say, when you look at the eye movie,
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.660]   we talked about the garage band,
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.240]   but when you look at eye movie,
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.840]   and then you look at the upload to YouTube,
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.520]   upload to, one of the things I plan to do at NAB
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.400]   is use this as my little preview device,
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   like when I'm shooting stuff,
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.120]   and I want to try to edit stuff together
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:34.040]   and upload them straight to YouTube on the device.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.240]   But you really have a little reporter in a box.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.160]   You can do voiceover,
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.160]   you can do all that.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.000]   - I agree.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.840]   - You can do all that.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   - It's a very interesting production tool.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.800]   - You can upload directly to CNN.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.640]   - Yeah.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.720]   - I report.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.040]   - Yeah, so it's pretty nifty.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.780]   - I almost can't wait to try using it that way.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.240]   I probably should have been Austin,
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.340]   but I was so busy doing other stuff.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.380]   - NAB's gonna be my big test case for that.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.360]   I'm gonna be doing some tests on making sure it works.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.380]   So I'll probably post some stuff to my YouTube channel
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.860]   over the next little bit of time,
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.900]   just so I can figure out if it works or not.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.180]   But I think that NAB's gonna be
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.740]   where I'm really gonna hammer it.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.500]   But I think people have been asking me,
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.260]   I have an iPad one, should I get an iPad two?
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.980]   And my tendency is,
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.360]   if you think you, for me it's mostly,
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.880]   if you really think you want the cameras.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.720]   - Right, that's exactly what I said.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.560]   - Then get it.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.520]   If you don't know if you're really gonna use the cameras,
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.280]   or you don't think that they'd be that important,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.160]   I'd probably wait if I already had an iPad.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.000]   Now, if you haven't got an iPad,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.880]   I would say this is best thing since sliced bread,
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.000]   you should get it because this is to me what I felt like,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.640]   wanna, this is like the super crazy one out.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.840]   - It's well worth getting.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.760]   - Well worth getting if you don't have one.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.940]   - But don't feel bad if you have an iPad one,
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.240]   you're not missing that much.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.120]   Unless for some reason,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.480]   you just feel compelled to get that camera.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.460]   I agree with you on a percent.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.060]   The thinness and the nominal,
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.160]   I mean, I understand it's much faster,
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.760]   but frankly using most of the apps that I use,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.340]   I don't see that speed difference.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.940]   And frankly how fast it renders the daily
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.960]   is not gonna influence me in the long run.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.960]   - Right.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.900]   - Garage band though,
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.660]   an iMovie might be pretty compelling.
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.060]   - Right, so not only that,
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.920]   but I think the video out,
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.020]   there are only--
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:12.860]   - Let's talk about that.
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.660]   You're doing that right now, Andy.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.700]   - That's coming behind you.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.420]   And so it is mirroring absolutely what goes on.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.260]   - Right, not only that,
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.780]   it's one for one, it will rotate with you.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.140]   When you launch apps, doesn't make a difference.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.220]   The app doesn't know and doesn't care.
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.740]   If you're using an app that is designed to work
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.420]   with the old video out,
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.820]   it will just simply,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.700]   it'll be mirrored until it decides that it needs to,
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.580]   until you start your presentation, for instance.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:41.540]   And then it'll be back to two screens sort of mode.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.300]   - I can't believe that we didn't get one of those--
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.140]   - The other--
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.820]   - Can I go to an Apple store?
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:46.660]   - Yeah, they're there.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:47.500]   I bought it right when I was one.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.340]   - I walked in.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.900]   - So they're not, they're made out of the iPads,
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.060]   but they're not out of the connectors.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.740]   - If you want one sooner than later,
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:53.580]   I have one in my house.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.420]   I mean it's--
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.420]   - I might have to borrow one for iPad today.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:56.260]   - When I've had it--
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.500]   - That's fantastic, Thursday.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.820]   But I'm gonna go to the Apple store today
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.180]   and see if they'll have one.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.140]   - But also there's,
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.860]   now they fixed one problem that,
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:03.820]   as you can see,
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.340]   you can have protected iTunes store content.
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.940]   It will stream,
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:08.780]   it will play out.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:09.620]   - That's awesome.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:10.940]   - It won't mirror however,
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:12.980]   your screen actually dims,
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.140]   probably because they figured that
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.940]   you went to the distraction of that.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:19.580]   It also will work just fine with FaceTime.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.620]   So you can be in the living room
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.540]   doing a pretty,
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:23.380]   - Oh, baby.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.220]   - Really awesome.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.380]   - You'll just go to the yoga app.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.780]   - And the cameras on the iPad,
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:28.700]   you're looking at the camera,
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.020]   but the big screen has all baby.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.100]   - Well, and I've been thinking about that.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.260]   - That's interesting.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:37.020]   - You know, and I think that this connection
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.420]   is a precursor to opening up the eye,
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.740]   you know, adding accessories
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.500]   or adding something else to the eye,
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.940]   you know, Apple TV too,
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.860]   because that's gonna let you know
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:47.540]   what it's really like to have an app,
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.420]   you know, available on the,
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.900]   you know, available on your TV.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.740]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.940]   - You know, like if you just had a little video input
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.500]   into the Apple TV too,
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.020]   you could do the same FaceTime,
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.580]   you know, you could have like a little camera
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.020]   that just popped onto the top of the TV.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.020]   - So if,
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.260]   see, this is the problem is it's not wireless to play.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.060]   Like if I had Angry Birds running on here,
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.180]   I still have to have it connected by a HDMI to my--
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.500]   - Well, and it's weird because the problem--
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.620]   - Because the devices were wireless.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.460]   - The problem with Angry Birds,
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.980]   as I did test Angry Birds on a large TV,
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.940]   I mean, I thought that that was very important.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.860]   (laughing)
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.500]   - The Plants vs. Zombies.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.580]   - I tested Plants vs. Zombie field runners
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.620]   and Angry Birds.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.860]   It was my journalistic integrity, you know.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.220]   And so the problem really is you can't look up and do it
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.540]   because you can't see what your finger is
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.380]   and what you're doing.
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.020]   So you're not, you know, you're still in the zone
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.340]   of the way you control it, you still wanna look down.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.300]   If you want everyone else to watch you do Angry Birds,
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.980]   you can, that allows them to do that.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.380]   - Look at this, he's got real racing up on it now.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.580]   Oh my God, Andy.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.820]   - Yeah, so now--
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.580]   - If you steer with the, I guess you're controlling it.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.980]   - I didn't test real racing.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.780]   - The problem again is it has to be wired.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:55.620]   That's my negative.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.900]   So I have to have a long enough HDMI cable or something.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.500]   - Well, but apps can implement the airplay.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.340]   They just haven't done it.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.940]   - Okay, so if a game implemented airplay,
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.220]   it could actually play wirelessly to the screen.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.420]   - Yeah, they just have to choose to do that.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.180]   - Yeah, so I wonder if there's going to be
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.980]   like a new hack you can do into the gaming.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.260]   So you can basically tell it to dual screw.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.140]   I bet we'll see more games that do--
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:20.980]   - Dual screwing.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.820]   - Take advantage of the screen.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:22.660]   - Sure, sure.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.220]   - And now here's the time where Andy stops talk
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.820]   'cause he's playing real racing.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.100]   - Somebody in the chat room's telling me,
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.060]   and this is very interesting,
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.860]   that the old VGA adapter will also give you mirroring.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.460]   - That's very true.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.420]   I work with VGA.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.860]   It is an iPad 2 specific feature, however.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.100]   So we're asked this new adapter will work with the iPad 1
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.780]   in regular two-screen mode.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.660]   It will not mirror.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.380]   Supposedly, it's a CPU dependent sort of thing.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.060]   It's a lot of horsepower necessary to mirror out,
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:58.140]   or at least to make it work consistently with everything.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.900]   And that's why you can only do it on the iPad 2.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.380]   - He's playing the game, folks.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.660]   - When he started, we usually mean price car.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.500]   This is awesome.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.820]   (laughing)
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.340]   - One of the things that I think is really interesting
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:14.500]   about the, is that a lot of the dual screen usage,
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   so like when you're using penultimate or sketchbook pro,
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.500]   what you see on that second screen is like a whiteboard,
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.900]   or a grayboard, or whatever.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.860]   And you have the whole interface on your iPad,
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.860]   so you're able to draw and talk about stuff
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.620]   and see the paint brushes and see all the other pieces.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.700]   But it looks completely different.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.900]   So using these as a whiteboard,
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.300]   when we get into like educational uses and so on and so forth,
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.900]   I found that Sketchbook Pro is an incredible whiteboard.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.340]   You know, where you can-- - No kidding.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.820]   - So there, and that's what I've been using for--
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:43.660]   - No kidding, I'm trying to-- - You're on training.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.500]   - You're on a train-- - You're on a train.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.340]   - You're on a train. - That up on the big screen.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.340]   - Yeah, with your iPad.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.740]   - I wanna do it with AirPlay though.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.740]   I really don't wanna have a wire attached.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.260]   - And all these apps, they just need to add that feature.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.260]   - They can do it. - Yep.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.100]   - Okay.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.980]   And I'm actually relieved that the VGA cable does that,
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.220]   'cause we do have a VGA cable,
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.740]   and I think VGA is a little simpler for us
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.860]   to connect to our system, so that's great.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.620]   All right, we had a jailbreak last iPad.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.980]   All right, we're gonna talk more about the iPad 2.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.100]   Andy's a little busy right now, so we'll just--
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.180]   - Don't commercial. - We'll get back to him.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.620]   (laughs)
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.580]   A little, I won't do the Audible ad right now.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.340]   I'll tell you what, we'll save that for a time
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.620]   when Andy is a little more available.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.620]   - I don't know, so that's good, sorry.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.660]   - No, no, that's quite all right.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.220]   You keep playing that game, sir.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.140]   - So basically, Leo, you're saying,
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.460]   put down that game, you've got books.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.460]   - Oh no, no, no, no, no, I don't wanna--
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.300]   - So how we teach you?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.900]   - I wanna do that to you, actually.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.460]   I wanna talk about fresh books,
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.180]   and then we'll save Audible for later, okay?
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.260]   So play on.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.180]   - Oh, look, I got Audible pickles, I can do that.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.940]   - No, no, I'm responsible adult.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.460]   I'll tell you that, everyone will have to play your game,
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.980]   Andy, come on, if I were you, I would.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.500]   He stopped it, he stopped it.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.780]   Actually, I do wanna talk about fresh books.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.060]   Fresh books makes invoicing easy.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.900]   I used fresh books when I first came out,
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.900]   Amber MacArthur told me about fresh books.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.460]   This was 2004, 'cause they were a Toronto company,
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.540]   and I just fell in love with it,
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.420]   and I used it for invoicing for years,
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.980]   until I had a staff.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.260]   It's like you have a staff now,
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.140]   all of a sudden, a bookkeeper's helping you,
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.460]   working with you, makes it easy to invoice.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.700]   Those invoices look professional,
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.300]   'cause you're gonna up up logos and everything,
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.500]   so much nicer than that, you know,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.500]   using a word or a page's template for invoicing,
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.860]   which is what I was doing.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.460]   Of course, it does all the arithmetic and everything,
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.580]   and even has a time tracking program,
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.700]   both on the desktop and on the iPhone.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.620]   So if you're doing time tracking a lawyer or whatever,
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.540]   you do the time tracking,
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.500]   and then you automatically import it right into the invoice.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.900]   So it really simplifies and streamlines invoicing.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.780]   Makes it so much easier to send out that invoice
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.100]   in a timely manner.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.940]   Makes it easier to get paid too,
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.820]   'cause your customers can pay with credit card.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.140]   There are 11 payment services, including PayPal,
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.740]   so, you know, it's just,
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.340]   they're getting an electronic invoice,
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.780]   it's on their screen, they click a button, they pay you,
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.420]   it's out of their mind, out of their head,
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.620]   and you get paid right away.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:57.740]   I tell you, it actually really works to get you paid faster,
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.340]   and should you have a late pay client,
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.020]   automated late pay reminders,
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:05.020]   make sure that you don't let it slip through the cracks.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.580]   You can, some clients, I have to admit,
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.380]   now this might have changed, but back in 2004 and 2005,
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.820]   some clients said, where's my paper invoice?
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   I would invoice Rogers with an electronic invoice.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   They said, we could, we would like a paper invoice too,
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.780]   and I said, okay, fresh books,
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.020]   you buy the paper invoices in a bulk,
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.060]   and then it just, you press a button,
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.620]   it prints and mails and stamps and everything,
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.980]   so you don't have to touch the paper,
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.420]   it just does it, so it sends an electronic
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.420]   and a paper invoice.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.620]   I just love it.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.500]   - You gotta grease the rails, that's the key.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.100]   - It greases the rails for everybody.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:38.300]   You and your clients, so you will end up
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.900]   not putting off invoicing, which I always did.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.700]   - There were times when I would like,
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.580]   it would be like three months after I finished the project,
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.940]   why did I get paid, and I was like,
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.580]   oh, I forgot the bill, and what happened was,
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   in the first week I was like, oh, I don't want to deal with it,
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.620]   I can't find my word doc, I can't find the word doc
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.660]   that I just done the last one,
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.660]   I can't remember what my invoice number is,
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.460]   I'll get around it. - Right, what's the next
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.340]   invoice number, that's a good one.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.380]   - So I remember, now three months,
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.620]   I remember there was a client,
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.820]   I didn't invoice for nine months,
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.140]   and they were pissed when they got the invoice,
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.300]   he was like, we didn't, we would have paid ya before,
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   but why didn't you, so, this program saved my life
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.260]   over and over again, fresh books, painless billing,
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.180]   that's their slogan, and it's absolutely true,
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.220]   two million people now use fresh books to pay
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.420]   and send invoices, and you can too,
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.180]   it's free for up to three clients,
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.540]   so for a lot of you, that's it, that's all you need.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.020]   - That's all you need.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.540]   - It takes about a minute to set up an account,
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:34.100]   and you can do it right now, freshbooks.com.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.100]   They may, I think they ask, they source it,
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.660]   and if you would, just say you heard it on Mac Break Weekly,
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.420]   we'd like you to do that only 'cause,
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.140]   not we don't get paid, we get paid either way,
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.780]   you know what I'm saying, but I want all of our shows
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.560]   to get credit for listeners.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.500]   Unfortunately, a lot of people just say,
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.940]   I heard it on Twitch, no, no, say you heard it
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.500]   on Mac Break Weekly, just so we get credit, either way.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.740]   - Twitch already got enough credit,
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.260]   Twitch gets plenty of credit, those sons of guns.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:06.260]   Freshbooks.com, give it a try today.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:12.020]   - Short touches, Andy, I'm gonna give you full credit,
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.140]   full points, I said last week, I was a little miffed
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.540]   that Apple didn't allow pre-ordering,
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.380]   that you had to stay in line, I said,
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.700]   I submitted the conspiracy theory that it was in fact,
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.940]   'cause they wanted those lines, you said no, no, no,
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.300]   they don't need the lines, this is gonna sell like crazy,
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.260]   you were absolutely right, yes there were lines,
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.980]   but it was absolutely constrained supply
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.660]   because if you order online now, it's I think four to five weeks,
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.660]   it changes every minute.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.740]   - Yeah, four to five weeks.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.660]   - Yesterday they were saying two to three weeks.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.500]   - Yep.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.140]   - It's clear that they are selling more than they can make.
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.820]   - The analysts are saying a million over the weekend?
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.380]   - That's gotta be at least a million, right?
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.380]   I would say.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.500]   There were lines at the pop-up store, that was a store,
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.220]   I was in Austin, there were lines Friday,
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.260]   there were lines Saturday, there were lines Sunday,
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.740]   I was surprised they still had stock on Sunday,
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.940]   they sold out on Sunday, and I was told that that store had
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.820]   almost as many iPads as any other store,
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:06.940]   in fact there was only one store with more
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.100]   and that was the New York store.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.380]   I think now all the stores are sold out, am I right?
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.740]   You cannot walk into a store right now and get an iPad too.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.300]   - Yeah, I believe that's the case.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.340]   - Yeah, I called around yesterday,
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.580]   I called six different stores, I found four
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:24.380]   that were completely sold out too, that if you really want
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.460]   and you need an iPad too right now,
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.140]   we can sell you the 16 gig model with the color
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.420]   and carry that nobody wants,
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.860]   but get down here right away.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.220]   - So April 22nd, if you order today,
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.460]   I'm one of our listeners, E.B. Fanes,
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:41.340]   as you ordered today and I'm gonna get it April 22nd,
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:44.020]   so that is five weeks.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.020]   - And that's it, I think that they are gonna be sporadic
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.180]   supplies at the Apple store.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.020]   You know, I think that's what it's about.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.900]   - There was a story, and I'd actually like to have
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.820]   this confirmed or not, there was a rumor that the Apple stores
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.500]   would open early this morning as they got restocked,
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.460]   they would open at 9 a.m.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.500]   I don't know if any got restocked, so it chatted.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.900]   - I did, I did, I talked to, I was at an Apple store
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.780]   Friday for the festivities and overheard the store manager
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.740]   advising somebody that they did intend to open at 9 a.m.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.820]   today, I don't know that they actually did though,
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.620]   that's just something overheard the store managers.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.220]   - I heard it too.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.740]   - I heard it too.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.460]   - But yeah, I think that this might be the tipping point
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.820]   where Apple starts to rethink their policy of how they handle
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.540]   an opening day like that.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:31.460]   They're gonna be a circus full of people at every mall
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.900]   and every store waiting to buy.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.500]   I don't think they can help the fact that there's always
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.180]   a chance they'll get N plus one people compared to the
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.540]   provide paths they have on hand.
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.180]   I did get an email from somebody earlier today who told
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.940]   his own story that made a lot of sense.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:48.380]   He was disappointed that it's okay to be like 300 and 300
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.180]   in line, it's okay to be told by the store manager
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.500]   don't worry, we've counted up a number of people
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.740]   and if you've got this wristband on,
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.900]   you'll definitely get an iPad.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.700]   What they didn't, he was disappointed that by the time
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.620]   he got to the headline, he could not get the 64 gig
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.140]   black iPad from Verizon, he had to take what was available.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.300]   We might be down to a point where they basically allocate
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.180]   here the number, here the kind, what kind do you want?
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.020]   Great, here's the one we're gonna be able to sell you
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.020]   by the time he gets to the headline.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   - I thought that the smart thing that they did in the
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:19.260]   San Francisco store was that they actually had cards,
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.420]   they had a cards that represented how many they had
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.860]   of everything and they were going down the line asking you,
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.580]   okay, so what do you want?
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.500]   And then they hand you a card, like that's what you're
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.780]   gonna buy, you know, like when you say do you want one or two
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.300]   and then you say what color and what,
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.380]   and you could tell that when they were going through
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.380]   the line to make sure that no one was at the far end
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.540]   of the line being told that it was gonna be there
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.180]   and it wasn't gonna be there, you know,
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.460]   but they were using these little index cards basically
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:46.260]   to manage making sure that people aren't waiting in line
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.420]   'cause the line was a long time.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.060]   - They're getting better at it though, I think that's good.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.420]   It's a good sign that they kind of understand their issue.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.500]   - I didn't sit in the line the last couple of times
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.380]   and when we got into the line this time,
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:00.740]   they have like in San Francisco, they have the little velvet,
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.100]   they have the little velvet ropes, they go all the way
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.740]   around and then they have Apple employees like man
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.780]   in the whole thing to make sure people stay out of the way.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.660]   - Given that their aligns are doing a good job of it,
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:13.780]   it was fun in the Austin store, they would cheer each purchase.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.260]   So there's this great feeling of excitement.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.620]   - They do it more than anyone else.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.220]   I think they're the only ones that have to deal
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.060]   with these like lines every six months.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.900]   You know, it's kind of an odd thing to get good at.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.780]   - Yeah.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   So if they've run out or they're close to running out,
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.180]   a million seems reasonable.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.980]   I mean, they sold a million, they say if Verizon iPhones
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.180]   in the first weekend, so it seems they must have sold
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.780]   at least a million iPad 2s.
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.340]   - It's hard to say how many they were able to make.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.380]   I mean, that's the whole thing is, you know.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.140]   A lot of times there's, Apple is so particular
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.100]   about so many things in their components
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.980]   that a lot of them just don't make it
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.820]   through the QC process.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.020]   - Well, we are seeing some scattered reports of screen issues.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.900]   I know Brian Brushwood got that yellow screen.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.660]   We saw that with the iPhone 4.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.580]   Seems to be the glue hadn't cleared or cured rather.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.460]   And so you're seeing little weird things
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.980]   but that they went away in time.
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.420]   He brought his back replaced it.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.980]   That might be an adhesive problem.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.860]   There also apparently are some reports scattered again,
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.700]   not very widespread of back light leakage around.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.620]   - Mine doesn't have too much as well.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.020]   - You have some?
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.700]   - No, well, you always have a little bit, in my opinion.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.460]   I haven't seen one. - Mine looks awfully good.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.340]   I might have to say this is a very smooth,
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.900]   best way to be looking at a black screen.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.060]   - Yeah, you definitely want black all the time.
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.860]   Every time that I've seen an example of this,
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.900]   they've always had like a black picture
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.380]   of our black screen board screen.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.100]   - Oh, I'll put a black show of black background on it too.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.340]   - I guess I've seen it with all of them.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:46.300]   - I almost noticed it's most noticeable on black.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.980]   - It almost seems, I have to say,
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.700]   it almost seems like this is a better looking screen
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.060]   than iPad one, is that possible?
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.140]   Or is that just because it's shiny and new?
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.300]   - Shiny. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.620]   I can't tell the difference.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.340]   I thought so too, then I realized,
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.260]   "Oh, that's right, I keep the brightness down
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:04.340]   "to almost nil on my own."
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.180]   So, okay. - Oh!
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.220]   - You seem to walk away from the distortion field.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.260]   - Huh.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.620]   - Walk away from the distortion.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.300]   Let's see, this is the closest thing I have
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:16.060]   to a black screen, is our Twitch screen on here.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:16.900]   Let me go.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.340]   I think it looks pretty good all around.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.420]   I mean, I don't see any bright hot spots
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   or bright spots anywhere.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.980]   If I turn the monitor up even brighter,
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.060]   would I be more likely to turn it all the way up?
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.780]   Turn off the auto brightness.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.780]   As bright as it can get.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.060]   Looks pretty good.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.580]   What I love, and by the way,
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.300]   if you're thinking about getting a white one,
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.020]   one thing I should point out
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.380]   is that there's an optical illusion
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.060]   with a white border that is smaller screen than it is,
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.300]   because you just kind of almost assume
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.460]   that the rest of this black part.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.300]   - Yeah. - It's part
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.220]   as a screen.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.100]   So, it's purely optical illusion, I know,
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:54.940]   but the white screen ones look a little bit smaller.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.460]   - Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.620]   The one that Apple sent me is a black screen,
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.180]   and I've spent now about an hour
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:06.140]   using a white screen model, and it just feels kind of raw.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.100]   - Yeah. - Like, yeah.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.100]   - I like the black. - Yeah.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:09.940]   - I like it. - Yeah.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.300]   - That's the one I would opt for, you know.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.500]   - Also, philosophically, the iPad works so well
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.460]   because the device itself is just a picture frame
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.220]   for the content and for the apps.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.660]   I just feel as though the white screen calls attention
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.580]   to the device instead of the tracks
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.380]   from the actual movie you're watching
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.140]   or the webpage you're reading.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:31.660]   - I got the Verizon model just for Grins.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.300]   Can't really tell any difference between it
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.420]   and the AT&T model, although I was a little shocked
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]   by the pricing menu.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.420]   You can have one gig, two gig, three gig,
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:41.740]   four gig or five gig caps.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.900]   I think there's even more.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.060]   - The 10 gig cap to.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.340]   - Yeah, it's expensive.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.740]   It's 35 bucks for a three gig max a month,
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.580]   60 bucks for a five gig max a month.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.140]   - I don't know why I've been such a Verizon curmudgeon,
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.180]   but I was just like, "Rah, I'm just gonna get an AT&T one."
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.300]   You know, I was just like, "Buh, uh."
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.780]   - Well, I don't think it makes much difference.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.540]   I still have my old AT&T iPad.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.380]   - Right. - And in Austin,
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.460]   where presumably there's a lot of AT&T traffic going on,
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.380]   of course they bring on extra trucks and stuff,
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.260]   but extra base stations, what do they call them?
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.500]   - I didn't notice any particular difference.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.740]   - I don't know if there was a difference or not,
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.020]   but I just know I was sitting in an office
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.780]   building yesterday in San Francisco,
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:21.340]   and I couldn't connect via AT&T,
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.060]   and I was like, "This is what I get."
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.380]   - You know, like, "This is what I get for being,"
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.100]   you know, "Sond of a gun about this."
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:26.940]   You know?
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.020]   - Well, and that's why I got Verizon,
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.260]   so I could lord it over you.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.100]   - Yes.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.100]   (laughs)
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:35.500]   - I think for people who write a lot about Apple,
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.580]   I think one of the factors is going to be,
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.180]   how many people in this press room are going to have AT&T,
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.780]   and how many are going to have Verizon?
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.580]   If so, I want the one that fewer people want.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.340]   - But the other, they don't have, yeah.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.180]   - Yep.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:48.020]   - That's kind of why I chose Verizon.
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.300]   - I did look at the price instruction between the two,
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.140]   and for most users, if you use two or three gigs,
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.340]   the price plans work out exactly the same.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:57.700]   If you plan on using practically no 3G,
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.500]   you'll spend less money on AT&T.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.100]   If you plan on making,
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.300]   spending using a crazy, stupid amount of 3G,
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.620]   like more than four, five or six gigs,
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:12.140]   because you can buy the extra data on the Verizon plan.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.060]   It's cheaper on Verizon.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.500]   On AT&T, the upper cap is lower,
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500]   so you'll always be paying over each charge.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.420]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   - I think that both companies were aware that
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.500]   here is the typical user.
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.620]   We got to make sure that that other company
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.700]   is not going to be charging less.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:25.940]   - Well, I bought three gigs,
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:30.060]   and I see I've already used 1.3 gigs in three days.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:30.900]   That doesn't--
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:31.740]   - Holy sh--
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.580]   What are you doing?
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.900]   - That doesn't bode well, does it?
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.220]   - What were you downloading?
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.220]   - Well, now this says reset 1,128,
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.700]   so maybe it took some of the usage from my old one.
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.540]   - Okay.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.940]   - No, that can't have been.
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.900]   Well, I'll reset it now.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.380]   Let's reset it now.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.700]   That's weird, because you know,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.820]   and by the way, we should talk about setting up a new iPad.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:53.180]   It seemed to work quite well for me to take my old iPad,
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:56.860]   back it up, and then restore it onto the new iPad.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:00.700]   It's interesting because Apple kept FaceTime and camera,
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.180]   even though those weren't part of the original backup,
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.020]   obviously, on my old iPad,
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.820]   but did not include GarageBand and iMovie,
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.340]   so I had to download those.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.700]   But they were smart enough to keep the two apps that,
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.580]   and photobooth, too, that come with the new iPad
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.660]   on the new iPad, so I like that.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.300]   It was painless, and I didn't have any problems,
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.660]   even though I went from AT&T to Verizon.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.620]   - I'm always a big start from scratch guy.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.420]   - Yeah, I would be, and so easy to start from scratch.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.580]   Oh, I will say one thing.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:28.100]   It's so easy to start from scratch,
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.260]   because you just sync everything.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.100]   You've already synced it.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.420]   You should have everything.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.900]   I do have to point out, though,
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:36.300]   that even though it preserved my folders, which is nice,
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.380]   it didn't actually put a lot, some of the apps,
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.220]   but not a lot of them.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.740]   A lot of apps got orphaned out of the folders,
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.340]   which means I have a lot of work to do
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:44.780]   to put those all back into the folders.
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.340]   - You know what, it's actually one of the reasons
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.860]   I start from scratch, is the new one
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:51.140]   has about one quarter of the apps that the old one has.
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.780]   So the old, I really went through and I went,
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.060]   do I really use that?
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.180]   And I added each one really slowly,
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.460]   because I was like, you know,
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.700]   'cause I have 400 apps on my other one.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.860]   - When I give that advice on desktops,
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.540]   it's always best to start with a new OS,
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.820]   clean install, and be very judicious about reinstalling apps.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.420]   I don't feel like on a tablet device,
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.860]   it really matters how many apps you have,
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.420]   as long as you have memory for it.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.900]   - I just found that all I was doing was just search.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.780]   Like a search for the app,
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.180]   'cause I don't even know where it is.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:20.700]   - But that's why folders are so great.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.700]   - Even with the folders?
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:22.540]   - Well, the folders just slide.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:23.900]   - I have a whole second page of folders,
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.220]   so I know exactly where everything is going.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.740]   - I have that too, but it's just easier just to go search.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.700]   - Well, I see a lot of people doing that,
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.100]   where they slide it over to the right,
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.700]   and they just type the first few letters of their app.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.060]   - So I decided to be really,
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.060]   really careful about what I wanted to add.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:38.900]   - Yeah.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.700]   I wish the search, this is actually the same mistake
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.100]   that Microsoft makes with Windows Phone 7.
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.300]   The search doesn't just,
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.780]   you can't constrain the search.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.820]   It gives you apps, music, emails.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.660]   - Yeah.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:54.380]   - This can be kind of big if you're not careful
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.540]   about what you type in.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.380]   It'd be nice if I could just say,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.100]   "Just search the apps."
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.660]   Anyway, that's a minor thing.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.020]   What Twitter client are you using?
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.100]   You know, Twitter has said now,
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.860]   don't make third party apps, don't do it.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.180]   - You know, I don't Twitter from my app.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.540]   - We want everyone to tweet with our clients,
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.780]   our own official clients,
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.260]   after I have to say Andrew Stone DM'd me,
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.340]   and said you should try Twitter later,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.060]   'cause the new iPad two version of Twitter later,
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.980]   and I have to say, I do like this,
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.020]   lets you send not just pictures,
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.460]   but you can also record audio and record video
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:30.300]   and send it out directly from the tweet menu.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.900]   He's done a really nice job of this,
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.140]   I have to say, geotagging is on,
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.680]   you can insert map links,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.540]   built in hashtags,
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.980]   built in ads,
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:43.780]   and it's got other little emoji icons you could ever want.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.780]   Actually, these aren't emojis,
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.660]   these are just from character set, but still.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.300]   Oh no, there's the emojis.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.580]   Look, the emoji.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.620]   So.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.460]   (laughing)
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.460]   - I like emoji.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:57.260]   - I do very little tweeting from my,
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.100]   you're not a twee.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.220]   - No, no, no, I do tweet.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.380]   - Oh, probably more than people prefer.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.060]   - I do it mostly for my iPhone.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:06.180]   My iPhone is like my little.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.060]   You might start wanting to do it from the iPad.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:10.740]   I used to use a Osfura, which Don McAllister recommended,
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.820]   but one of the nice things about this
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:14.020]   is it puts inline pictures.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:19.980]   It's just, I kind of like how he's created this system.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.140]   I just think it uses the real estate well,
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.620]   both in portrait and landscape mode.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:32.180]   And then if you click a link, oops.
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:36.780]   If you click a link, it has its,
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.780]   I guess that loaded Safari, didn't it?
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.380]   Yeah, that's Safari.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:44.260]   Anyway, that's just one of my, that's Twitter later.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.900]   I change Twitter clients all the time.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:49.060]   Not my pick of the week.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.220]   I just thought I'd mention that, and I like Andrew.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.260]   So I want to give him a plug.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.540]   What else should we talk about?
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.500]   We talked about supplies.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.620]   Do you want to talk about the A5 chip?
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.820]   Apparently they're clocking it a little slower
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.900]   than the A4, which is interesting.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.700]   And yet we are seeing benchmarks that are quite fast.
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.180]   - Not quite, what they're saying is that there are,
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.660]   I am pleased that there are people who actually
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.180]   will do tear downs of the CPU.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.820]   You can look at here's an electron microscope copy.
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.740]   That's how they figured out that it was a Samsung chip
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.820]   because they looked at the, they looked at the typeface
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.260]   and plus the actual way for itself.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.380]   They, okay, that's the same typefaces
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.620]   on this other Samsung chip.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.020]   Like, oh man, there are people who take life so diligently
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:33.940]   and so seriously.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:36.900]   And I want to, I want to send them $5.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.180]   - That's just for that.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.820]   - Actually, you know, I wonder if I could,
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.620]   like this could be like the start of the ground
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.260]   swell of support for this idea.
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.540]   I had this idea after once again, being so pleased
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.620]   and so grateful for I fix its tear downs.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.700]   I got the idea that there should be like a voluntary
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.780]   $10 ahead tax that if you want to participate, that's fine.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.420]   Here's the standard like central account
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.260]   to pay your $10 iOS or Apple tax to.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:05.300]   And the board of 10 people decide that like I fix it
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.580]   is doing such great service on a weekly regular basis
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:12.340]   to the entire Apple and iOS community that you get basically,
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.860]   here you get 5% of all the taxes collected from this.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.740]   And we will basically figure not just, hey, well,
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.500]   you did a really good app, we want to reward you.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.340]   I'm saying that the people who build these free apps
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.060]   and these free things that everybody benefits from,
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.500]   like the people who do Instapaper, great free apps.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.420]   Here you go, you get 2% of the fun for 20 hours.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.060]   - I agree, you get some ideas.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.820]   Although I have to say Marco does charge
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.100]   for Instapaper on the iPad, it's free everywhere else.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:40.060]   And it's five bucks on the iPad, but it's such a nice,
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.300]   it's a way to support Marco.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.100]   So I'm glad to pay him for that, I'll tell you.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.540]   - But yeah, I'm sorry, but yeah, it's so right.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.140]   I think a fun would be a good idea.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.100]   - Yeah, it's an interesting idea.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:55.860]   But going back to the CPU, the teardown of the CPU,
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:00.020]   it says that it's two cores, each of which independently
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.660]   works more slowly than the A4.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.780]   So, but put together, of course,
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.860]   they work much, much faster.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.540]   That's just me reading other people.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.060]   - Yes, that's what I, but, and again,
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.460]   I don't know how iOS is different from a desktop OS,
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:17.380]   but in a desktop OS, unless an app is explicitly multi-threaded,
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.580]   it will just use one core, which means
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.700]   some apps may potentially be slower on the iPad too.
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.540]   - Okay, but I think-- - I think the iOS
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.900]   is smart enough to do something like that.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:31.300]   - I think the iOS is separating you from that.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.500]   - Okay, yeah, I'm all I'm saying is that
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.140]   if my test app was an iPhone app,
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.860]   it's not even written for the iPad,
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.820]   and there are no multi-core processors available
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.420]   for iPhone yet.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.780]   So I'm very confident in simply saying
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.340]   that every app will get a significant speed boost
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.660]   just for free. - Especially if you're using
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.820]   the libraries that are next code,
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:52.700]   that are going to do those things for you.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.580]   If you're using specific libraries
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:55.580]   and not trying to write the code,
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.420]   if you're writing the code yourself from scratch,
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:00.460]   you're probably gonna have to make sure you access those,
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:03.100]   but if you're using the core libraries,
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.380]   I think that it's gonna be, it's gonna optimize automatically.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.140]   - Sorry, don't pay any attention to that noise.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.900]   I'm just pairing up my pick of the week,
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.980]   which we're gonna get to in a little bit,
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:16.780]   but one more story that comes to us from Europe.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.780]   (laughs)
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.140]   I love the stories it got.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.460]   The Apple, the Granny Smith Apple.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:24.540]   So this is actually, there's some interesting facts
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.300]   in this story, this is from Paton Lee Apple.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.420]   I guess Apple made a deal with Apple Core,
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.020]   the Beatles company, that all Apple Core logos,
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.860]   all Apple Core logos, including this famous green Apple
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.460]   that's part of the Beatles records,
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.580]   belong to Apple, they may have to pay some license fees
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:46.340]   to Apple Core, but all, so Apple has now submitted
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:50.780]   a trademark registration in the US for the Granny Smith,
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.820]   but it doesn't mean necessarily they'll use it,
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.340]   it's just part of the deal.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.820]   Also, the royalties split, according to reports,
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.940]   could be more lucrative for the Beatles and other artists,
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.860]   more than the 30%, and it's a unique licensing deal
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.780]   that says Apple may pay royalties directly to the artists,
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.180]   instead of treating them as retail sales
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:15.820]   and paying royalties to EMI, the label.
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.660]   Ouch.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:19.140]   Well, I think that's great for--
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:19.980]   - It's great for the Beatles.
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:20.820]   - For the Beatles.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.660]   - EMI's like, "EMI's is ha"
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.380]   - That's why you want something, right?
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.220]   - Sony apparently owns the also a part
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.740]   of the publishing catalog, so Sony would get some money as well,
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:29.900]   but directly from Apple.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:33.580]   Let's see, I'm in pairing mode, I need to do my pairing.
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.100]   So we're gonna take a break, come back with more
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.380]   in just a little bit, we are talking about Apple,
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.460]   and oh, I was gonna give you my review
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:44.780]   of the MacBook Pro 15, the new, the new,
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.100]   the Sandybridge, F-ing Fantastic.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.860]   Putting the SSD in there is great.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:51.220]   In fact, I only got the 128 gig SSD,
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.860]   but it's big enough for me 'cause I have an Air,
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.540]   and I have 64 gig Air, so I have to say,
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.420]   kudos to Apple for the migration assistant.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.860]   It just, it makes it so easy to move to a new Macintosh.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:05.420]   I took the Air, knowing well, that's not got anything more
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.100]   on it than I can fit on this new thing.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.460]   Air does not have, of course, FireWire,
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.820]   so I couldn't use target disk mode,
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:14.180]   but they say plug an ethernet cable in,
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:16.740]   it's a little slower, but it did a perfect job
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.700]   of transferring not only all my documents,
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:22.340]   but all my apps, all my settings over to the new MacBook Pro,
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.220]   runs beautifully, I didn't have to do anything
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.780]   to make it, it's there, it's working.
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.980]   And then I put bootcamp on, put Windows 7 on,
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.780]   it runs Windows 7 like a bat out of hell.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:34.660]   Right.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:37.700]   I mean, really fast, some say, actually, it's faster
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.140]   because Microsoft does a better job
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.180]   of using the Sandybridge's monthly threading.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.660]   And then I put VMware Fusion on it,
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.900]   immediately recognize the bootcamp,
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.180]   and I'm able to run Windows at a very high rate of speed
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.180]   within OS 10 is just slick.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.940]   Boots and seconds, it's fantastic.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.860]   Highly recommended.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:59.500]   And noticeably, by the way, noticeably faster everywhere.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.300]   And it's got Thunderbolt.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.380]   Well, I'm waiting, yeah, you know, when will that,
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.220]   when will that.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.980]   So I, so yeah, that's gonna be
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.420]   hideously expensive, isn't it?
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:08.260]   I don't care.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.900]   But that's why I did not really mind
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.020]   only 128 gigs, 'cause I figured,
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:13.900]   well, I can always have a--
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.740]   That's the whole thing.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:15.580]   I think the-- I think the--
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.020]   I think that what I'm really looking at is with Thunderbolt,
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.100]   that you really can say, I'm gonna have everything externalized.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.500]   You know, everything else is going to be connected
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.740]   outside of my computer.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.300]   I mean, when you look at a 700 megabytes a second,
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.740]   megabytes, not megabits, megabytes a second,
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:35.220]   'cause it's a rated SSD.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:39.860]   So, you know, so, RAID 0 SSD, you know, with a Thunderbolt.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.740]   And what that means, you're just to kind of put it
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:43.940]   in perspective, my big HD camera
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.060]   that shoots 444 uncompressed
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.260]   is a whopping 189 megabytes a second.
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:52.860]   So I could theoretically capture three of those,
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:56.340]   you know, do a three camera shoot uncompressed 444
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:58.060]   into this drive.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:00.620]   Now, it wouldn't actually work, but two of them, possibly.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.660]   So I could possibly do stereo, you know, you know,
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.500]   a stereo 444 uncompressed--
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.340]   You could do 3D.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.180]   Off my laptop.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.260]   You could do 3D.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:11.220]   3D 444 uncompressed, off my laptop.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:13.620]   You know, like, that's the future that's coming.
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:16.380]   And that's why I think NAB is gonna be really exciting,
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.700]   'cause I think that at NAB or IBC,
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:23.740]   it'll be either NAB or IBC in September in Amsterdam.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:25.820]   One of those two, we're gonna see a ton
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:29.820]   of professional level Thunderbolt tools
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.340]   that are gonna turn these laptops
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:34.580]   into just incredible, you know, workstations.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:35.820]   We're gonna be at NAB,
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.700]   the National Association of Broadcasters Meeting.
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.140]   It's coming up in April, Alex, Lindsey, and I,
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:40.980]   and all of Twit.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:43.180]   We're actually Twit's the official podcast partner
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:46.060]   to the NAB, so we're gonna have some great coverage of that.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.180]   I know it's a little bit inside baseball.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:49.980]   It's kind of more of a broadcast-ex convention,
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.380]   but I think because of things like this--
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.220]   - It's a lot of cool toys.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.540]   - There's lots of cool Apple stuff.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.540]   It should be fun.
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.980]   You're gonna broadcast live from there.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.060]   We're gonna broadcast live from there.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:01.660]   We're actually partners with the folks at NewTeko
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:02.500]   to our TriCaster.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.300]   We're doing a really interesting future
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.300]   of digital streaming broadcast panel
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.740]   that I'll be on along with the NBA
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.580]   and Adam Corolla talking about streaming,
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.420]   which should be fascinating.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.460]   We'll broadcast that live.
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.860]   Digital is called Digital Minds.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.420]   So lots of stuff from NBA, NAB coming up.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:25.340]   When I said NBA, I meant NBA for the panel.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.340]   - And I may be streaming the Sunday before,
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.860]   if I'm just finalizing the OKs,
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.700]   I'm talking actually about live streaming as well.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.540]   - Yes.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:34.460]   - The components of it on Sunday at NAB.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.940]   So if you're there for the course loads,
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.580]   but I'm actually asking for permission
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:40.420]   to take one of my courses and stream it,
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.540]   I figured streaming the show up,
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:44.220]   the seminar about streaming.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.940]   - I would love you to do that.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:46.780]   - That would be useful.
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:47.860]   So stay tuned.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.740]   Next week I should know if that's all finalized.
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.260]   So I'll talk about it on the show.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.180]   - All right, folks, our picks of the week are coming up.
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.740]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.700]   We did get some Mac news in there.
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.500]   Wasn't crazy, but I got some.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:59.340]   Ha!
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.700]   There's iPad 2 and Mac news.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.740]   It's actually one of the most exciting Macs,
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.780]   almost ever released as far as I'm concerned.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.020]   - So the new MacBook,
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.740]   one of the reasons I got the 15 and not the 13
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:11.820]   is the 15 has both the Sandy Bridge
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.220]   Intel motherboard based graphics,
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.340]   but some very fast video graphics on it.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.820]   And this thing is smoking.
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:22.100]   - Yeah, I have one on loan that I'm reviewing.
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.500]   So as soon as I find a week in which there's no Apple news
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.780]   that I can actually find on review the notebook.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.300]   And I'm gonna be buying one myself next few weeks.
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.860]   - Yeah, this is the biggest upgrade to MacBooks
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.060]   in a long time, I think.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.660]   - Yeah, I mean, if you were limping along
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:39.420]   with an older MacBook last year,
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.580]   waiting for the right reason to go,
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.100]   this is the reason why you waited.
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.220]   - Yeah, you wanna get new technologies
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.420]   like Thunderbolt when they come out,
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:48.580]   presuming that they succeed.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.420]   And I think we're, it's hard to tell
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:52.540]   if something's gonna take off, but this is not.
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:56.060]   - Apple did a good job here because it costs you nothing.
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:56.900]   - Right.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.020]   - If there's never any Thunderbolt,
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:58.860]   anything in the future.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:30:59.700]   - Right.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:00.820]   - All it, it's not even like,
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:02.380]   it's not even there's an extra port here
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.860]   that you will never be able to use.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.460]   It's the mini display port that's on the last year's MacBook
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.620]   is now the mini display slash Thunderbolt port.
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:13.060]   So, but I don't think there's gonna be nothing
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.140]   coming out the next couple of years.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.780]   - What's, my experience with battery life on this 15,
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:18.740]   I've only had it for a week, not even that long.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.300]   I got it Thursday.
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.140]   Is it's about the same as the old MacBook Pro?
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.700]   I don't know if it lasts.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.700]   - Yeah, it is the same.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:27.300]   Apple took pains to say that while they advertise
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.900]   that the battery won't last as long as last years,
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:30.860]   they're making pains to say,
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.260]   "Well, we changed our testing procedure."
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.380]   And so that if you were to test last year's MacBook
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:38.180]   with this year's protocol,
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.940]   you'll find that they both have the same battery life
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.700]   somewhere between seven, I think seven and a half hours,
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:43.540]   they're saying.
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.460]   Rest last year they're claiming eight or nine.
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.420]   - And it's really five in normal use.
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.260]   (laughing)
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.100]   - Four or five.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:50.940]   - Five?
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.780]   - As usual as.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:52.620]   - Wow.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.180]   - I don't, the deep soak test I did,
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.900]   I got close to eight.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.740]   - Really?
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.580]   - Wow.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:31:59.700]   - Well, that's, that's, I,
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.740]   if I have time, I like to do like lots of different scenarios.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.580]   - Right.
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.420]   - And so, so long as I can find a scenario in which
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:09.340]   I can get the rated, the expected battery life out of it
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.100]   without having to suffer, I'll take that.
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.980]   - So you might, and I think I use mine a little harder
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:13.820]   than everybody else.
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.180]   - What do you, what's the deep soak test?
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:16.220]   What is that?
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:19.060]   - The deep soak test, power the,
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.820]   watch a movie, brightness all the way up,
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:24.020]   use a flash video codec,
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.860]   something that's gonna really thrash the process
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.220]   with the graphics processor,
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:29.300]   anything that can create, that can draw power,
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:31.340]   please turn that on and have it actually active
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:32.780]   and working.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.980]   I don't go so far as to find the absolute worst case scenario,
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.340]   but I want to find out what's the least
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:42.620]   that you can possibly expect to get in a usage scenario.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.580]   And I'll drain it down to at least 50%
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:45.900]   of the next crap I laid from there.
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:50.900]   - Okay, I find that it's, for me about three and a half.
[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:52.660]   - Yeah, three and a half hours as well.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.500]   - Well, 'cause I bet you get those fans spinning up,
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.060]   and boy, when they spin up all the way,
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.580]   when I'm using it, I'm taking it off.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:58.580]   - When I'm using it, I'm taking it off to the top.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:02.700]   - So we know that that when that Nvidia kicks in,
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:04.100]   it's generating some heat.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.940]   - Yeah.
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:05.780]   - Yeah.
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.980]   - I have to say though, it's a power tool.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:08.820]   - Yeah.
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.220]   - I still prefer my air for like getting around.
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.180]   I brought the 15 inch tooth Austin,
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.860]   just 'cause that, you know, just to use it and stuff.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.220]   But I mean, the air is gonna be my travel and computer,
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:22.020]   but if I need power, if I'm taking pictures on a trip,
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.500]   I'll bring the MacBook.
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.340]   - Yeah.
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:25.980]   - Awesome, the proof.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.780]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.620]   Our picks of the week coming up,
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.500]   but right now it's time to pick an Audible book
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.660]   for you Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:35.220]   You know what Audible is, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:38.460]   It is just simply the best source for audio books
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.540]   in the world.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:44.300]   About 80,000 titles now, books, comedy performances,
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:48.780]   radio shows, there's even audio versions
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.180]   of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.020]   By the way, if you get a subscription on Audible,
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.020]   those are free to listen to daily updates
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:55.340]   from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.780]   That's part of your subscription.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.540]   I encourage the subscription.
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:01.660]   You know, I have the two book a month.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.660]   I'll tell you what, try with the gold plan.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.100]   That's one book a month, one flat rate.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.020]   Almost all the books on here are single credit,
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.220]   which means you can get any book,
[01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:10.340]   or almost any book on here,
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:14.860]   except for the really, really long ones every month.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:17.700]   And there's really the challenge at Audible
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.500]   is they have just built their list so well now
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.860]   that whether it's classics or bestsellers,
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.620]   history, science, science, fiction,
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.820]   no matter what kind of book you like to read,
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:33.300]   there are hundreds, thousands of books in that category,
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.980]   and it's very difficult to choose.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.820]   Andy, I'm listening to the book you recommended
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.620]   a few weeks ago, this mother's brother's book,
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.260]   and loving it.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:43.980]   - Yeah, that's actually, there are few books
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.460]   that I enjoy so much that it actually,
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.140]   they never get deleted off of my iPhone.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.460]   Because it's always worth dipping back into it
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:57.460]   for another go, and that definitely made it onto that list.
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.260]   - You know, Tommy's mother's is a parent
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.700]   at the high school my kids go to,
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.140]   and I did not know, you don't know from behind the scenes
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:08.500]   if it turns out Tommy's the comic genius,
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.660]   really the guy behind most of the show.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.220]   And the next time I see him,
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.620]   I'm just gonna have to bow down to him,
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.180]   because when you read this book,
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.580]   and you read how principled his stance was,
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.300]   and that show could have gone on for many, many more years
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.020]   ahead of you not caved into,
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.660]   had he caved into CBS, but he didn't.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.100]   He stood for what he believed in,
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:30.660]   and I think he's an inspiration for all of us in new media,
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.500]   you know?
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.340]   - You know, that's one of the reasons why I like this book
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.380]   so much, because the author was very balanced about it.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.860]   It wasn't hero worship about Tommy's mothers.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.820]   They, he spent, I think he spends,
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:43.900]   the author spends just so much time saying,
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:46.540]   Tommy was picking fights 'cause he wanted to play fights.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.380]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.300]   - He lost sight, he lost his sense of humor,
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.740]   and he lost his sense of the goal.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.180]   At the end of it, there's almost a kind of a heartbreaking
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.500]   call-off on, which it says that,
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.940]   do you know that if he had simply found a way
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:59.780]   not to be a pain in the butt for six more months,
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.700]   there would have been a regime change at the network,
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:04.620]   and that show could have gone on for another two or three years.
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:06.900]   - It is a little bit of a Greek tragedy, you know?
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:10.500]   He could have been the Lauren Michaels of our era
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.260]   and instead of Lauren Michaels, but nevertheless,
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:16.980]   I identify with Tommy and his willingness to pick a fight.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.620]   (laughing)
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:21.020]   So I kind of liked it.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.620]   But you've got another book for us to pick this week.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:26.220]   Another one, and this is one of those chances,
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.580]   those times where I'm only three or four chapters in,
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.420]   I only started it a few days ago,
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.220]   but I'm loving it so much that, yeah,
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.540]   I don't have to finish this.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:36.420]   It's by Tracey Kidder, it's called Mountains Beyond Mountains.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.740]   I'm sure that a lot of our listeners
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.300]   have already heard about it.
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.540]   It is a first-person account written by Tracey Kidder
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:46.780]   as he follows around this doctor who is working in Haiti.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:50.260]   As he was at Harvard Medical School, he visited Haiti,
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:53.100]   was really captivated and fell in love
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:57.180]   with not only the country, but also taken by the overall problems
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:01.500]   of everybody who has to live, thrive, and survive down there.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.940]   And so it is a long essay about the problems
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:09.060]   of what one person can do to try to solve as many problems
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.180]   as possible.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:13.940]   And it's so captivating because I think the first-person
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.260]   perspective is perfect because we're not only,
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:21.100]   Tracey is following this doctor around as he tells
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:25.420]   his own story and also goes about his daily routines down there.
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:28.220]   And not only are we hearing the story,
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:30.780]   but we're also hearing, he's substitu-
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.660]   the Tracey Kidder is substituting for us,
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.980]   how are we reacting to this?
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:34.820]   What are we thinking?
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:36.460]   What questions are going through our own minds?
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.140]   And his arc is pretty much following our own arc
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:43.260]   because it's not your basic Oprah's book club.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:46.300]   Oh, isn't it nice that there are angels in the world
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:48.900]   who just, it doesn't take that easy route out.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:52.460]   It really says that this is hard boots on the ground work.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:55.260]   You have to go through multiple shifts of attitude
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.260]   to figure out how to make things work.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:00.260]   You cannot, if you really care about the people,
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.060]   you cannot take, you cannot be so self-indulgent
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:06.340]   as to go into all these people or enemies,
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:07.500]   and these people are good people,
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.020]   and I'm gonna side with the good people.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.220]   You have to have all of these different people
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:12.340]   and all these different factions
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:15.180]   and all these different agencies working together.
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:19.900]   So I'm only on chapter four, but it's one of those books
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.060]   where it's like, I can't wait until another two hours
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:25.940]   when I get to eat dinner and I can keep reading this book.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:30.500]   I did download the Kindle edition of the book,
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.620]   rather than the audio book edition,
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.260]   but because I can't wait to keep,
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.980]   if you go to TraceyKitter.com,
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:39.180]   the entire first chapter is available for read.
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.060]   And as soon as I read that, I'm like,
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:43.300]   I don't wanna have to wait until I'm in the car driving.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.660]   I'm gonna go listen to this.
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:48.180]   But if you do have a daily commute,
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:50.660]   man, it will change your frame of mind
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.540]   in so many different ways by the time you get
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:54.980]   to the office or back to the house.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.580]   I expect this is gonna be one of my favorite books.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.420]   - I agree.
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.340]   I actually have listened to the audio version of it
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.660]   and it's fantastic.
[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:03.780]   It's funny because I try to read books
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.860]   and I fall asleep, I can't do it.
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:07.740]   So that's why I have to have Audible.
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.140]   It's the only way I can listen.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:12.060]   I actually get in the car just so I can listen sometimes.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.580]   - I have a trouble with my most recent book.
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:18.700]   I'm listening to Denviso Moyo's How the West Was Lost.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.340]   Which is, she's an economist from Zambia
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.820]   and she wrote Dead Aid, which is,
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.820]   and then she's written this one.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:26.660]   And it's really an incredible breakdown
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.500]   of what's going on right now financially for the US
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.300]   and why we're in trouble.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.740]   And it's pretty sobering, but this is like a,
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:38.620]   I mean, it is like getting a master's
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.180]   or at least an undergraduate in economics.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.020]   'Cause I mean, it is so complex.
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.500]   - So that would put me right out.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.340]   - Oh, it doesn't put me out.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.180]   Like, what I found is that I literally,
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.980]   I can't do what I normally do, which is like,
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.340]   I clean the house or whatever.
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:50.900]   I find myself like rewinding and going,
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:53.260]   okay, wait, say that one more time.
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:55.780]   You know, but it's a fascinating book.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.420]   But it is not something you can do in the background.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.260]   - Yeah.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:00.100]   Well, see, there you go.
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:01.220]   There's all kinds of books.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.060]   - So now I have to sit, I just have to sit in my yard
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.540]   and stare off into the distance.
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:06.780]   - I'm listening to Denviso Moyo.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.940]   Please leave me alone.
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.300]   You're wired in.
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.900]   - That's incredible book.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:12.740]   - A couple of great.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.740]   Well, see, this is the problem with Audible.
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:16.100]   And I tell you, when people who are Audible subscribers
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.740]   gather, most of what they do,
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.020]   most of the conversation is like,
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.340]   what have you listened to lately?
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:21.180]   When you like?
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:22.860]   - It brings you back to reading.
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:23.700]   It makes you love reading.
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:24.980]   And once again, I love that,
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.900]   'cause I've always loved reading.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:27.820]   Now I love listening.
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.380]   Audible.com/MacBreak, your first one's free,
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.540]   but I can guarantee you won't be your last.
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:35.740]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:38.420]   We thank them for their support of all of our shows
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:41.500]   and do make sure you use that MacBreak URL
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500]   so that this show gets credit.
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.260]   If you decide to subscribe to Audible,
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:48.940]   we like getting a little credit for this show.
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:51.300]   Let us get our picks of the week.
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.020]   Well, I'm gonna start, I never start,
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:55.140]   but I'm gonna start today 'cause I've got it all set up.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:56.900]   This is so cool.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:58.900]   Oh, oh, my battery's full, that's good news.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.820]   This little red thing is the Jambox Jawbone,
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.140]   from Jawbone.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.820]   Jawbone, you know, makes those ear pieces.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:09.260]   This is a Bluetooth speaker that actually has a microphone
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:10.500]   in it, so while I use it, in fact,
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.180]   we keep it upstairs for our conference calls.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.140]   So if you go out and you buy those,
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:16.500]   the big conference call systems,
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:17.980]   the polycomms or whatever, you don't need that.
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:19.820]   If you, is it a microphone in it too?
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:20.980]   Has a microphone.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:22.380]   So it's a conference system.
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.220]   And it's a great speaker.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.900]   So, you know, I really started to use it now
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.980]   because the speaker on the iPad too is so small.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.740]   I'll just play some music out of here
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.580]   and you can hear how good this sounds.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.900]   (soft music)
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:38.500]   It's really got good bass.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.740]   If you, it comes out of both sides.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.460]   So if you want improved bass, I use this on the cruise.
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.380]   I'd put it in the corner and it would fill a room.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.940]   Doesn't that sound bad?
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:49.460]   Now that's out of the straight out of the iPad.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:52.780]   So you get much, much better audio quality.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.660]   And if you're using GarageBand or something like that,
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.380]   now it's not cheap, but that's the,
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.020]   this is the negative on it.
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.620]   It's about $200.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:03.820]   I know, I know, I know.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.460]   It's expensive.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.020]   But it's cool when you hit the plus.
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.500]   Yeah, it's got, it's got, it pairs easily.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.180]   You can have a pair to many different devices.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.020]   What?
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:14.940]   Is this as loud as it gets?
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:15.780]   No, you want to turn it up?
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:16.620]   Turn it up.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.860]   I just want to know what the...
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.580]   I think that's all the way up.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.420]   Okay, it is all the way up.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:22.340]   Press, press, yeah, I think it's all the way up now.
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:23.180]   It's great.
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:23.980]   But, okay, watch.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:24.900]   Now that's how loud it gets,
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.500]   now put it in a corner, it'll fill this room
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.220]   because it's direct and reflect.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.340]   So I put it in like little wooden corners
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:32.820]   and you get incredible bass out of it.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.660]   It really sounds good.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:36.420]   But it's not, look it, it's not a high-fi system.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.940]   But it is a really great little system.
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.140]   We'll work with any Bluetooth device,
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:41.660]   including not only the iPad, but your MacBook.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:42.540]   And of course, your iPhone.
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:44.020]   I haven't heard of my iPhone.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.300]   It's Bluetooth 30 feet.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:49.860]   What I would do is I'd set up in the cruise ship
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:53.300]   and then on my iPhone, I'd be listening to my audiobook.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.860]   And then when I went to the bathroom,
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:57.820]   I would take it into the bathroom and take a bath.
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:59.380]   So it goes everywhere, you know, it goes around.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.780]   Well, it's kind of nice that you can just kind of carry it around.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.700]   I have this thing where I listen to NPR in the morning.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:03.700]   Perfect. And it's just like--
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:04.540]   That's your radio.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:05.380]   And I just kind of move it around.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:08.380]   Yeah. And wherever, as you shave and brush your teeth and everything.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:09.940]   It's a decent sound.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.860]   I wish it were less expensive.
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:14.420]   But I think adding the conference call feature
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:19.140]   makes it particularly useful because it does have a microphone in it.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:21.940]   So this is our polycom unit.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:24.980]   I sit that there in my office and we sit around it and it sounds great.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.580]   Because Jawbone knows how to do that stuff.
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:28.620]   So that's to the Jawbone Jam box.
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.140]   That was expensive.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.820]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:31.900]   Are you ordering it right now?
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:34.020]   It might be like 179 on Amazon.
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.180]   I know.
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:38.180]   I wish it weren't so expensive.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.980]   I don't know why it's so expensive.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.580]   But I think it's--
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.140]   And again, well, you've heard it now.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:46.620]   So it says it can go up to 85 decimals.
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.540]   And I have to say it's not going to fill a giant room.
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:51.780]   But if I put it in the corner over here,
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:53.820]   so that it's getting the reflection off of it.
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.900]   We should do the 99.
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.900]   199.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:58.740]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.540]   Jawbone from Jambox.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:01.420]   Alex, stop.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:02.500]   Don't order that.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.460]   Give us your pick of the week.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:05.300]   My pick of the week.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:08.700]   So I just have to pick it because I was so excited about it.
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:10.220]   We were talking about it earlier.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:10.660]   What's that?
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:11.580]   GarageBand.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   It is amazing.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.740]   GarageBand, if you iPad 1, iPad 2,
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:16.580]   you have to download GarageBand.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:19.220]   It's like 399 or 499 or 299.
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:20.380]   I don't even know how much it is.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.460]   But it's worth every penny.
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:22.140]   No, I think it's--
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:23.780]   Aren't they both $5.499?
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:24.300]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.300]   And it is--
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.100]   Tell me what to show because I got it right here.
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:27.620]   OK.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.340]   I mean, just show the keyboard.
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.220]   Smart keyboard.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.220]   OK.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.980]   And then-- so I was showing the smart keyboard.
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.580]   And then, yeah, start hitting the--
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.900]   Turn up the sound, see.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:39.540]   OK.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.500]   And then set the little-- hit the little button
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:42.260]   in the middle there.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:42.940]   That's a stain.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:43.460]   Sustained.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.020]   Turn that on.
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:48.340]   And then just hit one and just kind of hit the top ones.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.540]   And then just--
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:50.620]   I mean, isn't that just--
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:56.060]   And the thing is, is that when you start--
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.180]   I started building up some layers and working on it
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:44:59.220]   and so on and so forth.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.180]   And if I was in corporate music, building
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:04.180]   little corporate-based stuff, I'd be--
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.100]   It's terrifying.
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:05.900]   This is the B3.
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:06.900]   I would be terrified.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:16.540]   And when I thought of this, when I looked at this,
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:18.100]   I was like, this is like GarageBand.
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.700]   But at the end of the game, you actually have a song.
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:22.180]   [LAUGHING]
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:23.220]   I mean, that's the whole thing.
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.500]   Is it-- look at this.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:28.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:32.740]   How are you changing the keys?
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.460]   So auto key.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.740]   There's different auto plays.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:37.060]   No, but it depends on where you hit the--
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.580]   if you have the top, middle, and the bottom,
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.860]   you get different effects.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.220]   No, but is there a way to change all these keys?
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:45.060]   Or is it all-- that's the one thing I've been living in these.
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:47.380]   I can turn up the rotation on the beat and the beat.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:51.860]   And so the-- but the thing is, my son loves it in these three.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:56.940]   My wife saw it for a minute and was like, OK, I need to have an iPad.
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:02.220]   I mean, it was-- and the thing is, is that it is a--
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:07.380]   I just feel like this is such a precursor to--
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.060]   You know this thing.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:08.900]   I'm rocking.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.100]   I want to be playing with this thing.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:11.300]   No, I see what I'm doing.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.820]   It's like me with the driving game.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:13.860]   You just-- you've--
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.860]   lose sense of where you are because you're having fun playing
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:16.940]   with this thing.
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.700]   And even if you don't end up with a song,
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:21.020]   I mean, it's like-- I can just sit there and just totally
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.740]   just fill time goofing around with it.
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:23.020]   You know?
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:28.500]   And it is amazing.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.420]   And so the only thing I'm hoping is,
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:32.980]   is I'm hoping that Apple will either get very aggressive
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.740]   about adding more instruments or open it up.
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:37.140]   They never have before.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.620]   You can plug a guitar into it.
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.100]   You can choose your amp.
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.580]   You can sing into it.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:42.780]   Oh, and these amps are--
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.500]   Look at these amps.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.340]   They're just great.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:45.700]   I mean, they don't have brand names,
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:46.460]   but you know what they are.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:48.980]   These are just awesome.
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:50.020]   And it's just--
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:51.220]   It's heavy.
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.900]   Anyway, it's just amazing.
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:53.900]   And then you can do your own--
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:54.580]   Use the audio recorder.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:55.900]   And eight track, right?
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:56.900]   Yep.
[01:46:56.900 --> 01:46:59.540]   So I can record the music.
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:01.020]   I can record the singing.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.580]   I can plug in a microphone.
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:06.180]   And there are some really high-end, higher-end interfaces
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:10.620]   that you can get for your iPad through the USB connector.
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:12.780]   And does work on the standard USB connector?
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:14.420]   I don't have to do anything special.
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:16.380]   Some of them-- no, there's some that are made for it.
[01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:19.300]   And then there's other ones that are USB compliant, which
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.980]   should be usable soon.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:23.980]   You need to have our USB.
[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:24.980]   Is he right?
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:29.660]   Stand back.
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.660]   Here comes my art rock.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:33.060]   But it's masterpiece.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:38.940]   Sounds bad as bad as--
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:41.220]   Yeah, the two on the end.
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:42.220]   Stay away from those.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:42.740]   Yeah.
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:44.180]   Two on the end, stay away from them.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:48.820]   Two on the end are--
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:50.660]   E major, A major, and D major.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:51.620]   We don't like those.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:53.620]   No, it's just two on I-D
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:55.620]   The P's, the B-D minute.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:57.620]   Anyway, but--
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:58.260]   This is so cool.
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:47:59.740]   It's just--
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:00.820]   That's all I got to say.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:05.580]   I mean, I don't even know what any of this means.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.940]   And it's still fun to put this here.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:07.940]   And that's the whole thing is that--
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.380]   You would go crazy with this thing.
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:09.740]   Right.
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.220]   And it's just-- it's major--
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:11.900]   No, they're minor.
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.620]   Sorry.
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:13.500]   M is for minor.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:14.380]   Thank you.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:15.260]   What am I, an idiot?
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.260]   Yes.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.780]   I told you I didn't know what I was doing.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:18.780]   It might--
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:20.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:24.140]   Also, you do notice that the harder you tap the iPad,
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:26.900]   the harder it recognizes as a harder hand.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.100]   It's using the gyroscope.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:28.620]   Yeah, man.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.620]   OK, watch.
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:32.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:35.620]   Isn't that crazy?
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:38.580]   It's one of those ideas that it's obvious
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.060]   once somebody else comes up with that.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:43.700]   And then you realize, how come we didn't realize this early
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:46.140]   on that we could have used that to mimic velocity sensitive
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:46.940]   input?
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.420]   Well, and the thing is, is that this is--
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.620]   but there is so much technology in here to make this work.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.540]   I'm like a four-year-old.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.220]   Yeah, I apologize.
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:54.220]   I know.
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:55.540]   But that's what it brings out.
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:56.780]   It brings out a lot of fun for me.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:57.780]   Or '99.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:59.100]   I can't believe it.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.460]   I just think it's a stunning application.
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.100]   Now, what's this is the sampler?
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:04.140]   So you can sample.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:05.380]   So I can record a sample.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:05.860]   Yep.
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:06.620]   And then play it.
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:07.940]   Go ahead and try it.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.620]   OK, now I've got that.
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:14.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.700]   And you need to do patience.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.660]   So in case you're asking, officially now,
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:25.140]   Apple has technically entered into the fart application
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.140]   game.
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.140]   [LAUGHTER]

[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.260]   It emanates from the human body.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.860]   You can record it.
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:35.300]   And play it musically.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.780]   There's a Ferris Bueller segment here somewhere.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:38.900]   Yeah, right, right.
[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:42.140]   I don't know why my headphones keep going down in volume.
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:42.820]   Why is that?
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:43.540]   Is that just going to be?
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:44.780]   Is it my playing too loud?
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:45.820]   I don't know what you're doing.
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.300]   It goes to 11.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.500]   It's probably the Bluetooth thing.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:55.980]   That's so much fun.
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.220]   All right, $4.99.
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:00.020]   That sells the iPad too, right there.
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.580]   Yeah, no, it is-- it's--
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:02.060]   it's--
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:02.580]   damn.
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:03.080]   That's--
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:07.380]   And I'm guessing that by--
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:10.620]   not today, by Thursday, every Apple employee
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:14.100]   in every store who has to stay at the iPad side of the store
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.380]   will want to kill the GarageBand team.
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:17.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:20.220]   You have to listen to "Fart Wart" when it's a click.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.300]   Well, it's like every music store in the world,
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:23.940]   a guy comes in place stairway to heaven, right?
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:24.900]   It's just what--
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:28.780]   And what I'm hoping is is that bands or Apple or both
[01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:31.020]   realize that there's a huge growth opportunity.
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:32.660]   When you're looking at trying to make money,
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:35.500]   if you have a huge platform of people who all have GarageBand
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.100]   on their iPad, what if you released a simplified version
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.820]   of your song that people could play with?
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:44.260]   You know, Nine-inch Nails has done this in the past.
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.980]   Of where, what if the tracks were all there,
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:48.020]   people could sing over them and play with them
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:48.940]   and everything else?
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:55.380]   You could charge $5 or $10 for the breakdown version.
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:58.580]   So can you add samples to this?
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:00.180]   Not yet.
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:02.700]   So it's a little limited as far as that stuff can do.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.300]   I can do my own Seinfeld drops.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:08.700]   But Apple in the past has created--
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:11.020]   in the past, they've created Jampacks and so on and so forth.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.420]   So what I'm hoping that we're going to see
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:15.020]   is a lot of extra things that they add to this,
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:16.900]   especially if everybody--
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:20.060]   And when you save a song out, the Peter Gabriel,
[01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:20.900]   I guess, did it.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.940]   You can send it to iTunes.
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:24.940]   Which is your iTunes, not the big iTunes,
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.260]   or you can email it to yourself.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.420]   And you can get it in GarageBand.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:32.100]   And supposedly, there is no practical difference
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.980]   between stuff that you recorded with the same hardware
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:37.100]   in the iPad and stuff that you might have recorded
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:37.820]   on the desktop version.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.820]   Really?
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.260]   I think the base limitation is going
[01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:44.180]   to be the range of audio gear that you can plug into a desktop.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.020]   Right.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.660]   But it's not as though you're going
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.020]   to have to redo this because you originally recorded it
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.340]   on the iPad.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:54.100]   So I would love to see more-- as you said, more instruments.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.420]   Presumably, that's doable.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.180]   It's just MIDI.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:58.180]   They're just MIDI instruments.
[01:51:58.180 --> 01:51:59.660]   It's just a matter of work.
[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:03.220]   And here's the problem where I feel like Apple hasn't hit it
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:07.860]   completely, is not building a way for third-party developers.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:11.180]   Just give them-- the whole lessons thing was a great idea.
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:13.700]   But the problem was is that it all had to be done by Apple.
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:16.500]   And so if they open this up a little bit,
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:17.900]   I think it would explode.
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:18.700]   I mean, it would just be--
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.180]   Imagine if you get instruments in here.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.260]   There's so many more instruments you'd love to have.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:23.500]   Right.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.460]   But I don't think Apple will do those.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.900]   And so I think that's the only--
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.140]   the only fly in the ointment is that I don't think the Apple
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.980]   team will allow us to--
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:32.420]   and what I'm saying is be very stringent,
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.900]   be super stringent about what can go in and how it works
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:38.060]   and everything else and work with maybe
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:39.180]   even only trusted partners.
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.900]   But let some third parties extend that.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:43.540]   I'm hoping that they'll do that because it
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:44.780]   would be huge.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:47.260]   It's all I got to say.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:51.180]   Andy, not go-- you're pick of the week.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:53.620]   If I can't simply say the entire iPad
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:55.580]   to an infrastructure--
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:56.820]   You can't.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:57.700]   Actually, I already did.
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:00.660]   So we already spent an hour talking about that.
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:03.980]   I'm going to pick an iPhone app, if like,
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:08.260]   because this app is a really wonderful intersection
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:10.860]   between barking mad and saying--
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:12.660]   and actually kind of useful once we install it.
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:15.780]   It's an iPhone app called TripMix.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:18.620]   And what it is, it's sort of an eight-track tape deck
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.220]   simulator for your iPhone.
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:23.300]   It's about time.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:23.780]   Right.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.580]   So what it will do is that--
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.300]   Look at that.
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:29.940]   This is what you'll see when you have your device
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.660]   on your dashboard.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.300]   And you'll see-- if you look at the--
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:35.220]   it actually will put an eight-track inside there that
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:37.860]   has the current song and the artist.
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:40.460]   It will play three songs by that artist
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:43.140]   and then click and move on to a different artist.
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:44.620]   That's funny.
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:47.780]   And also, for no particular reason,
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:50.420]   it gives you a trip odometer that simply shows you
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:54.020]   how much time you spent listening to music in this app.
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.900]   I think that's good.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:56.580]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:58.980]   It's an eight-track for your iPhone.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:00.700]   People have been asking when the eight-track's coming back
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:02.220]   while evidently today.
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:04.180]   Every road trip needs the right music.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.380]   TripMix gives you the ultimate road trip.
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.860]   Well, listen to--
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:10.460]   By the way, I just want to point out,
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:12.940]   this is the future of demoing iPad and iPhone apps.
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:14.740]   This is so awesome.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:15.740]   Thank you.
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:20.180]   I set this up because I'm shooting some videos that hopefully
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.220]   if I get a problem editing them correctly,
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.500]   will be posted tomorrow.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.620]   I've got to run out and do this.
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.260]   But already, I've already understood that the biggest
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:31.020]   pain in the butt has always been in not only doing
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.260]   online videos but everything.
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:35.420]   It's like going back in later on and having to cut in all
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.500]   the stuff I wanted to show.
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.300]   It was like, no, I could just simply
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:42.220]   talk for my usual three hours, cut it down to eight minutes,
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:44.740]   maybe insert a couple of photos in iMovie.
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:45.820]   But I'm actually there.
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:50.660]   But yeah, I do feel a little bit like in Alberta, Canada today,
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:53.020]   tragedy's throat on the trans-alaskan pipeline.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.780]   As four workers were scolded by Hot-Cotton,
[01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:56.860]   have the images.
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.580]   Right behind you, it's called Over the Shoulder Graphics
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:01.660]   in the broadcast news business.
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:03.260]   It is a cool thing.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.260]   So this is called TripMix.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:07.380]   The ultimate road trip mix available on the app store
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:08.380]   for the iPhone.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.620]   I'm going to get it.
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:11.420]   And buck 99, I've had it.
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:15.020]   I've actually just, I have a dash mount
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.420]   and it has become kind of my default music player.
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:20.340]   Because if I'm not listening to an audio book at the moment,
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.140]   if I've already listened to all my podcasts,
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:25.220]   I do have playlists, but even smartly playlists,
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.780]   you kind of have to build them yourself.
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:29.340]   But just the idea of choose three songs,
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:31.660]   then move on to the new artists before it gets sick
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:34.420]   of listening to Elton John or whoever I'm supposed to be
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:35.260]   trying to listen to.
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:37.100]   So it's artist focused.
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:38.380]   It'll send on artists.
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.540]   You can select anywhere between one and 10 songs
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:41.340]   before it'll move on.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:43.980]   So it's just cool to look over and see an eight track
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.540]   tape deck and again, a counter that does absolutely nothing,
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.620]   but just simply show you how much time you spent.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:51.780]   And the way I would love it, I would love it
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.820]   if they actually changed that to a simple,
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:57.940]   like just mile odometer or something just to make
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:59.260]   a little bit better use of that.
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:00.740]   But for buck 99, it's--
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:02.380]   I like the requirements.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:05.420]   It says a decent taste in music and a destination.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.340]   They don't check though.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:07.340]   I asked.
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:08.580]   They did that.
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:11.060]   Let's check that tasted music, buddy boy.
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:13.780]   If you like the eight track, you must have a good taste.
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:17.580]   I noticed five, four-inner albums and a greatest hits
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:18.740]   collection.
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:20.580]   Jesus, come on, it's ice.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.700]   All right.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:22.340]   That's cool.
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:22.780]   That's cool.
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:23.420]   I'm going to have to get this.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:25.020]   That looks really great.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:27.460]   Anionako is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:29.780]   And his own website is CWOB.com.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:33.380]   We'll look for that iPad 2 review any day now in the Sun
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.540]   Times.
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:36.860]   I pour or editor God have mercy on this.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:39.980]   And then the 800 page MacBook Pro review.
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:42.780]   And well, there's more to come from the Anionako.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.940]   I'm industrious.
[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:44.340]   He is.
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.500]   If nothing else, he's industrious.
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:49.380]   Alex Lindsey is the Pixelcore, Pixelcore.com
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:52.540]   for that great guild of multimedia artists working
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:53.540]   and training together.
[01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:56.460]   And then border sack.com, his own blog in Pixelcore.tv
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:57.780]   for the podcasts.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.180]   And I'm sure there are many other places.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.940]   We have a new studio coming.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.860]   We do?
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:02.420]   Can't wait.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:03.020]   We do.
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:04.460]   We're going to do a walkthrough sometime
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.460]   where we can have--
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:06.380]   You're ahead of us.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:08.420]   Yeah, well, we have a lot less to do.
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:10.940]   Alex is sharing space in our new facility.
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:14.100]   Leo is building the big shiny, really cool thing.
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.540]   And I'm building the industrial--
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:16.660]   Oh, like, here's a wall.
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.140]   Your thing's got cooler.
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:21.620]   He's got a green screen and a MoCap studio going in.
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.100]   Oh, there's that.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:22.860]   Next door.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.020]   There's that.
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:24.540]   It's nice, though.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.500]   It's all in the same space.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.860]   So it's really kind of convivial.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:27.220]   Yes.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:31.060]   And we're thrilled to have you share the rent with us.
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.660]   Very nice.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:33.820]   So thank you, Alex.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:35.940]   And we'll look forward to a tour of this space.
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:36.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.780]   So is the green screen painted?
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:38.180]   No, no, no.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.260]   I mean, we're going to do a little tour of where it is right
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:40.760]   now.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.020]   And I'm going to talk about what we're doing.
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:43.260]   And then we'll do a tour.
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.420]   We expect it to be fully operational the week after NAB.
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:46.900]   That's great.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.020]   We will be at NAB, the two of us.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:49.540]   Very excited.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:53.420]   And to it, covering it, the biggest National Association
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:54.900]   of Broadcasters Show that's coming up in April.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.060]   For us, NAB is really the biggest show of the year.
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.380]   So we're going crazy.
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.940]   There's going to be the Super Meat, which
[01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:03.500]   is, I think, on Wednesday night and the Media Motion Ball.
[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:06.740]   And we'll be at both of those with live use and streaming
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.900]   and wandering around.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:11.260]   And then, of course, doing stuff at the Twit booth
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:12.980]   and then wandering around the floor.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:14.940]   April 11th through 14th.
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:15.900]   Lots of fun.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.100]   We shall be there, too.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:18.540]   Let's see.
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.740]   That's about it for this show.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:20.900]   We thank you for being here.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:25.420]   And I encourage you to support--
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:26.740]   in fact, let me do it right now.
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:30.540]   I said, I pledged I would support earthquake relief
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.500]   by supporting the Red Cross.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.260]   So if it couldn't be easier on iTunes,
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.260]   it's right on the front page.
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:36.900]   You click the button.
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:39.140]   You get to choose how much you want to donate.
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:40.500]   You click donate.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.340]   You enter your eye-- oops, I got to try again,
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:44.540]   because I did it before.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:47.300]   Enter your eye turns-- eye turns password.
[01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:48.580]   See that big Red Cross right there?
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:49.820]   You know when you're doing it this way,
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:52.500]   that you're donating to the official Red Cross.
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.580]   And Apple does not keep any of this money.
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:57.060]   Of course, it goes directly to the Red Cross.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.700]   And it couldn't be easier to support.
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:03.260]   And so in the name of a Twit listeners everywhere,
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:06.620]   we're going to give $100 a day for the next few weeks, at least,
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:10.860]   until it's all getting back on its feet.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.020]   Japan's getting back on its feet.
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:12.780]   So there you go.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:15.540]   So I encourage you to do that as well.
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:17.860]   That's it for this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:18.900]   Break time's over.
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.500]   Now get back to work, my friends.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:22.220]   What are you doing over there?
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:22.660]   What are you doing?
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:23.340]   Get back to work!
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:25.300]   I'm going to get back to work!
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.540]   I'm just killing toner.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:28.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:31.120]   (upbeat music)
