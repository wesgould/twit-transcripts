[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.600]   Joining me right now Renee Richie from i'm more calm and beautiful
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.360]   downtown Montreal
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.200]   Actually, he's out by the you're up by the what is it the boy song? No, that's what I mean
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.520]   Yeah, both yeah, both wrong bottle. Yes, it's it's beautiful
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.440]   I went out there today and it was it was covered in snow there were cross-country skiers and snowshoeers and I was trying to hike
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.480]   Through it and only at the end where did I realize that outdoor walk on your Apple watch only gives you half credit for snow what?
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.080]   You should get you need to use other you need to use other because it switches the anaerobic aerobic balance and I didn't realize that
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.480]   Well, you know liddance I happen to have the snow white Apple watch you probably were to work fine
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.200]   You see you see I accidentally dropped in your pot in the snow. Yeah, I was taking a photo
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.840]   It's so it's no white like your watch and I was taking a photo to do an article about what to do if you lose your
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.320]   earpods your air pods in the snow and then I actually lost one and
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.240]   It fell into not just a little bit of snow, but a mountain of snow
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.560]   So I was forced to retest my theory. I was listening to security now as I was walking
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640]   So I just pressed play again which forces them to turn back on even when they come out of your ear
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.520]   Cranked up the volume and then I heard you and Steve talking in the snow and I just clawed with my frozen hands
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.480]   I found you. Oh my god. It worked. I if Luke Skywalker had only known that he probably wouldn't have had to sleep in a tonton
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.200]   No, that's true. It says
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.040]   Andy and I co also here for the Chicago suntines
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.500]   Yeah, it's you know, it's that's it's this cost to go wireless. You know I have my wired headphones
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.520]   I dropped them down as sewer into open pit of raw sewage. I can write up, you know like a safety line, you know
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.320]   Renee's wearing his air pods just to demonstrate
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280]   It's an honor. It's an honor them finally. I
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   Know kid for a month. Oh
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.120]   Mine come on the 21st
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.520]   What I ordered right away, so it's because I didn't order right away
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yeah, they went out to like four weeks later. They're gonna be in stores next week though
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.880]   So you can run over and get it pair. All right good. Yeah, I'll have Megan get a pair
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.240]   Yeah, they'll be available at Apple retail at resellers and it's select carrier outlets. I'm just I'm so excited
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.600]   Just can't hide it. So they so if you got on right away
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:03.060]   You would say you would see when when are you gonna get him soon at the 21st in time for Christmas
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.920]   Yeah, barely when do you celebrate Christmas in Canada?
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.160]   It's a month early because we're not the same day
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.040]   Canadian Christmas in November is great
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400]   nice
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.800]   159 bucks. I guess they've solved the manufacturing at scale issue
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.340]   Sort of the X ones have been officially delayed now for three more months
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.240]   What are the X ones the X ones are the beats version the very the very small beats version
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.960]   So the beats solo the two of the beats versions have shipped the two big ones the cans, but the the beats X
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.240]   Yeah, the tiny ones on the screen there. They're also do you think this is the W1 chip that's causing the problem then I?
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.960]   Think producing that Apple was was you know, growing about how?
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.240]   my newt and how stuffed full of electronics that they had you know speakers and the noise canceling mics and
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.120]   accelerometers everything in there and I think it turns out that mass producing those is hard. Yeah
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.720]   These aren't cool. Go ahead nanny. Also, it's a beats product. So
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.080]   They have to really make sure they retain the signature feature of the brand
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.760]   Which is to annoy everybody else on the subway car with the sound leaking from your headphones
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.120]   Which is not tough not to crack with in air earbuds, but they're determined to make sure that it holds up that that beats
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.240]   Signature they do but it makes it good for the snow they do make them in white if you want to lose them and stuff
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.480]   But they have they're they have a wire around your neck
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.040]   As opposed to the lovely air pods so Apple Apple kept some of the super technology for itself
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   and these are W1 now
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.640]   These are everything that were these the headphones are aptX compatible a new Bluetooth audio standard, right?
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.880]   Far as I know yeah, they'll work with any standard Bluetooth device so like an Apple TV
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.800]   They use aptX now. I know the iPhone doesn't have aptX, but the MacBook Pro does I don't know
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.600]   That's a good question. I just paired them and used them like a dumb
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.080]   If you don't know how wise but let's see I didn't even think about looking because I've gotten so used to an Apple ecosystem
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.040]   We're all like a like a TV and everything is just abstracted away. Yeah. Well, so there's a better Bluetooth now
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:17.480]   A2DP is the old stereo music standard is somewhat compressed and I have been told I think we talked about this
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.320]   on Sunday
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.720]   When did we talk about this maybe was last week with Adam Christians said who was it told me this anyway?
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.000]   Oh, no, I guess it was it was divinder Harder war who told me this on Sunday on twit
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.680]   That because I was complaining that Bluetooth headphones even expensive ones don't sound quite as good as wired headphones
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.240]   And he said aptX that's the new
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   technology is a little less compressed sounding but
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.680]   Oddly enough the iPhone 7 does not support it the MacBook Pro does there's more room. I guess
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.960]   So and I understand the air I was told I have been told that the airpods familiar with radios
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.940]   Radios let me see if Apple says anything here on the specs. Oh, it would be so nice. Yeah
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.100]   aptX is so I'm very interested in aptX and there are aptX
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.380]   Yeah, you know, you know it is it's very apply isn't it?
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.680]   they just
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.520]   Most interesting questions. What is Apple's policy when customers lose these headphones?
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:31.400]   Why does this happen to me is the first question? Yeah, yeah, why I do good things happen to bad people
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.600]   I mean bad things happen to it was funny speaking announced today a series of cords that you could put on to keep them together
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.800]   So that if they fell at least they'd fall as a big single unit. I really love the ear stud approach
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.680]   There should be a little tether
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.200]   That goes in your ear, you know in your in your lobe like an earring if they fall out. They just hang there
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.880]   Why can't we I would get my ears pierced just for that
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:03.320]   No, it's a chain that goes to your nose. Oh, there's gonna be a kickstarter in this
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.360]   the the people who have like those stretched earlobes though the the the the the discs that they're inside there inside their
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.520]   Lopes like a Bluetooth headset that takes advantage of the fact that that's the most secure place
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.880]   You know, it's horrifying for people who don't have stretched out your lobes
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.280]   But if you do why why lose your earbuds in the snow. It's a it seems like a no-brainer
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.240]   Renee, I do I didn't want to ask you a question. This is not a loaded question. Are you?
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.800]   Now you've had you've had these in your possession for a couple of months now. Do you?
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   Use them voluntarily. Are they your favorite earphones or
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.960]   Do mostly wear them when you did test something out?
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.280]   No, I wear them all the time. I wear them in the car when I'm driving I wear them when I'm out walking
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.320]   I wear them, you know, if I'm in a room and I don't want to disturb other people
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.000]   And I have the big bows, but they're phenomenal. They cancel all the sound everywhere
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.960]   I think they cancel my neighbor's sound but they're just really really big and I don't want that much weight on my head a lot of the time
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.720]   And I have the only problem with these is they're not noise canceling. So if I'm on a long flight
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.920]   I will still plug in the old bows because making engine noise disappears a wonderful wonderful thing
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.000]   And these are designed more for like you're out on the road
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.280]   You still want to hear that car coming which is a very different problem to solve for so I would say
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.520]   90% of the time I'm using these now, and I really like them
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.000]   So I can't find any information. I unloaded the question about
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.800]   Well, you know, I'm still using
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   I still like the Bluetooth headphones that I got for the purposes of testing
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.760]   I have to say that for convenience, I still find myself mostly wearing wired headphones, but only because
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.800]   I only have one pair of Bluetooth headphones that I can wear outside
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.880]   And if it's not nearby, I probably have a set of corded headphones already in my pocket or already my laptop bag
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.040]   It's not worth going upstairs to look for them
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.040]   My problem with the corded ones is that they always fell out I have ears that have been mangled by grappling for years
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.280]   And I would just go out for a walk and within two seconds
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.160]   They'd fall and I'd put them back in and I would end up holding one hand over my ear
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   Just to keep them in and I thought it was just my ears and nothing would ever fix it
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.600]   But the lack of a cord pulling on these means that I think like 95% of the time they stay in
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.640]   Even when I move my head around I mean they I have to thrash to fall out or I have to sort of lean over to take a photo and
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.240]   Jordy style headband that just goes over your eyes and ears and keeps everything in place the eyeglasses the eyeglasses
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.840]   I'm telling you I'm getting my ears pierced. There's got a you could get a jeweler to make you
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   Is there anything you could hook into this
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.960]   Prince apple is there any like anywhere on that?
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.000]   I guess you could drill a little hole in it somewhere maybe
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.880]   Well, Georgia had a separate set of
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.920]   Earrings that actually looped up underneath them not intentionally
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.240]   They just they were sort of like a tooth-shaped and they ended up just holding them what I thought was great
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.600]   Okay, if she just sent me the brand of those I'll get those instead
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.520]   Yeah, because if I'm not aware weird dopey things come and dribbling out of my ears
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   I might as well go away
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.680]   Usually just wear one because I mostly listen to podcast or audio
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   Yeah, yeah, and it's only half as goofy
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.240]   It's not that goofy. In fact when you were here
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.520]   I remarked because you were wearing them at at how surprisingly normal they looked
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.280]   We'll get used to we get used to everything don't we eventually yeah, yeah?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.880]   Uh anyway, you know what after last week's show I got a lot of hate mail and hate tweets and things
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.440]   from people who said
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.000]   You guys are so well mostly me so negative so gloomy and glum
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.400]   And so I'm gonna make this is gonna be a cheerful Mac break weekly
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.760]   We're gonna I got called an apologist. I was gonna double down on the hate
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.880]   Can't wait. We just can't wait. We can't wait. We have two nights or two not nice
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.240]   It doesn't you know hates or nays an apologist and Andy's handsome. I just don't know
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.440]   That's mostly the mail I get yeah
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.840]   Can you give me the phone number of that?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.640]   Good looking guy with the sideburns
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.520]   I like I kind of say it's what on my instagram
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.040]   Basically made a top gear analogy where
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.160]   Renee is Richard Hammond. I'm James May and your Clarkson
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.680]   Hey, if if I'd be in if I could choose anybody to be at be Clarkson
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   I come here producing. I want to punch you in the nose
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.320]   Again, I was ready to punch my gardeners in the nose this morning
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.720]   So the land the landscapers, you know the guys who come in every few weeks and trim the
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.160]   Stuff dumped for some reason. I don't know right. I was I'm only late for the show anyway
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.840]   I'm about to leave about ten minutes before 11
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.480]   And I'm open the garage door and there's a giant I mean it's a it's a
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.920]   Waste high pile of black bark right in front of my garage door
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:53.480]   Guys, I'm in here. Hello. I feel like I'm in Montreal and it's snow black bark or something
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.920]   I guess you guys are used to this, but I wasn't prepared for it
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.760]   And then I kind of I kind of think I dinged the Tesla trying to angle around it. I kind of hit the
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.480]   water softener and I don't know
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.120]   So I was ready to I'm I feel like Jeremy Clarkson. I'm ready, but I'm not because this is the cheerful
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.000]   happy go lucky
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.880]   Happy my Mac breaky slap happy
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.200]   I do want to start a petition now. This is not negative not negative
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   But I do really after thinking long and hard about what we talked about last week
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.600]   I really want to start a petition to bring back the cheese grater Mac
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.240]   That's what everybody wants really
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.040]   Don't think
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.200]   Nothing unhappy about that. We just
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.440]   I will say that and this is not and this is also not meant as a dig
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.760]   But I have like one cheese grater Mac act behind me
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:51.160]   It's now you being used as a it's basically a support pillar support for a small table behind me that supports by lights
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.920]   I'm looking to buy a second one so that I can build like a really nice like oak or teak
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.480]   Like top for it and make it into an actual functional coffee table
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.520]   It is it would it be turned on or would it just
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   Sit there. No, no, no, it's I'm
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:13.240]   I'm slow at render video. I'm getting it. It was it's so weird like I'm I'm doing a lot of like soldering
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.720]   uh like in the office and like
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.520]   I'm so I'm I'm dealing with like like rosin fumes and so like oh what yeah, which I had a small fan that looked behind me
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.480]   I say oh there's there a couple of like 12 volt score fans in there
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.840]   I so I
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.560]   I keep sat I keep like ripping it apart for parts and last week I took out the box fans
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.680]   Like it basically make a make a ventilation hood for my for my desk. So I use it
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.400]   I it's still useful. It's still like, you know making
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.120]   It's it's a little job. I like it's
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.840]   uh being ripped apart for parts, but hey
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.040]   G5 that's that's a testament to the G5. It's not even an intel
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.440]   what
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.760]   Oh, come on. You're like mine isn't a halo
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.560]   The halo is that though that was a halo mac pro. I think that's what I have to do
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.120]   Wanna so I was I finished my review of the apple designed in california book and going through those pages
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.320]   I was you know
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.680]   There's some great appliance computing designs there like the iPhones and the ipads
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:17.160]   But I was struck again how amazing and ingenious some of their some of their designs were when it came to making stuff accessible
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   Things like the original latch on the on the unibody mac that let you change the battery
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.680]   Or some of the ways that ram was placed in iMacs or mac minis
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.840]   And when you go through the pages of the mac pro design and I still have an a hill on one here
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.120]   And you take that side panel off and you see how there's no screws
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.920]   You pull out hard press push them back in chain pull out ram push it you can move pro
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.960]   It is
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.800]   A miracle of design and just apple used to be able to do both
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.760]   They used to be able to make computers that were absolutely gorgeous
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.160]   But that could also grow with you as you grow and I think there's an argument to be made that
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.280]   At like fine mobile is becoming an appliance because that's a very different audience. It's very mainstream
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.560]   They don't want to have to fuss with their computers. They just want to work. That's fine
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.120]   But I think once you satisfy that there's a huge argument to be made that you can take the desktop brands
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.400]   And you can do them like you used to do the mac pro and you can make them
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.080]   I'd love a mac mini tower that had some expandability to it
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.320]   With those same kind of clever latch designs. I think that those would be killer products
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.360]   So this was the last mac pro's 2012
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.600]   And it was a zon 3500. It was bloom field
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.080]   This is actually pretty usable. I think this is I have this at home
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   I'm really embarrassed to say
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   It's the kids computer. He's running windows and he plays all his windows. Can you throw some ssd's in there and it fly?
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.200]   Well, that's what I did. So I in fact we did it on a know-how I put ssd's in and I got the the latest graphics card
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.640]   I could you know you have a very limited choice of graphics cards
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.680]   For apple because they have to have the right the connectors the physical hardware is a little different
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.560]   But I got I got somewhere max sales or somewhere. I got
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.640]   The the last card I could get and it's actually he's using it to game all the time when on windows. So it's on windows 10
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.160]   It's pretty
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.880]   Usable. Maybe I should reclaim it. Maybe I should take it back from here
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:10.600]   Because this I wish you know because it's a it's a gorgeous object. I think it's one of the most beautiful computers of ever owned
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.040]   And it's fun. It's it's functional like there's there's so many things that
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.280]   I love the g4
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.640]   The g4 cube
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.800]   Which is still just one of the most exciting
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:27.240]   One of the most exciting computers to upgrade you kind of look forward to it because no tools you just I actually have one
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.040]   Do you have one right there? Oh, that's right. It's your lamp. That's right
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.240]   You turn his table his lamp
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.760]   Look at this five
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.320]   4.0, but there's five of them four firewire 800 ports
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:45.000]   Uh it had it I can't remember how many drive bays it had it was like eight drive bays
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.400]   Four was a ton you could put it and it was easy to put them in you just flip the lever and you just stay I mean
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   Jeez this would be and apple does have to do a new mac pro this spring. I would presume
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:05.000]   I hope I would love to see them. It doesn't have to look exactly like this, but let's do it tower. Shall we?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.920]   Yeah, that's that's such a cool challenge too
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.000]   The idea of saying that here is you can't make it banana shaped you cannot make it the side like a 3d
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.960]   You can't make it like a Klein bottle. You are stuck with making it a tower mac
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:27.320]   A tower computer that is basically engineered towards making it really easy to put drives in and upgrades because that's our user
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   No, but but that's that's what you're stuck with but how cool can you make it if i'm not going to let you make it
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.600]   Into a cylinder or anything weird like that, but this was cool
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   I mean this was really a beautiful design
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.680]   We call it the cheese grater because the way the front looks and the and the and the um
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.760]   You know the amazing little details like as the metal bends around the holes
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.160]   Don't
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.080]   Right distort. I mean that meant they they they drilled them distorted so that they would be normal once it been around
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.800]   I mean just just little things like that. This was so well
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.440]   Things and big things the the
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:08.920]   The the luxo iMac also was just amazing because not only was it super super cool
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:16.040]   Like the we have that floating 15 inch screen this on the on top of that sort of half of a volleyball
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   Sort of shape and then the more you look at it the more you realize that
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.800]   This is a machine that can easily be adjusted so that
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:30.120]   The parents can use it at the desk and then when the kids want to use it they can easily pull the screen down to their height
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.920]   the bar the bar that connects the screen to the base is sturdy enough so it can be used as a carrying handle
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.680]   Which is such a great echo to the original mac if you want to stand up and use it you can stand up and use it
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.080]   It's just such a beautiful
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:52.600]   Thing not just for its physical appearance, but how that physical appearance is 100% in sync with
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.680]   In service to the function that it's supposed to actually perform
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.400]   I mean if they if they if they stuck with that design and kept churning out iMacs like that
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.280]   Oh boy, that would I would not be displeased at all
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.360]   I like I think the current iMac design works just fine for me
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.640]   But the point with both of these is they're not really highly upgradable
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:18.120]   And and in the mac pro needs to be something a pro can throw drives in throw more ram in
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.200]   You know, I mean and it really it was the best pc case ever. I think it was really nice
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.720]   Um, yeah, it was genius. Oh, well, you know, I mean times change and so forth
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.200]   But I just I think while apples could I guess it's too late even probably if they're gonna
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.360]   Add something in the spring to even think about that
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.000]   Every few years there's a new dr. Julio. They have a chance
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.240]   Is a chance
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.520]   There's a chance
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:53.160]   Phil shiller says black friday was berry berry good for apple the highest monthly sales ever in the app store
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.800]   Uh
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   record breaker now since the
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.840]   The last year was 1.1 billion dollars in sales in the two weeks over the holiday season. It's got to be more than that
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.520]   So that's new the holiday season yet. That's still coming this month. Oh, that's right. That's just black friday
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.280]   He's announcing that records so you can get it on paper before the new one shadows it
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.120]   Yeah, it will be another one sure
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.080]   I'd love to see some numbers, but that's okay. We don't have to see numbers. That's their business not mine. See i'm being cheerful
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.520]   Well, I think they'll put like they usually put that out right after the holidays, but they want to tell the biggest number possible
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.240]   And that's gonna be the one like just in the right in a few weeks
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.200]   With all that mario run super mario run money
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:40.040]   In their coffee. Hey, that's coming. This is thursday, right? Have you yeah, do you have an advanced copy?
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.360]   I have seen the demo at the apple stores. I'll play it. Yeah, you can play it now at the apple stores, right? Yeah, or is it just a demo?
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:52.280]   It's a demo and it wasn't working perfectly when I was there because it was like three minutes after they set it up
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.840]   But I think you can't just to watch it and move around and stuff and it's it's mario. I mean, it's mario on rails
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.480]   It's it really is a endless runner sort of a thing, but as someone who's wanted
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.360]   Nintendo games on iOS products for a long time
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.520]   I mean my ultimate goal my ultimate dream would be to have nintendo make physical controllers and fy controllers that I could pick up and play
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.400]   On the apple tv and just have donkey kong and have super mario and have mario part
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.320]   And that way I would feel like i'm holding nintendo because my connection to nintendo hardware is their controllers
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.280]   And I would be able to you know and play those games and they would have access to hundreds of millions of devices
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.520]   But i'll take this for now
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:33.240]   There was some criticism about it because it has to you have to be online to play it, which is kind of impractical
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:39.000]   Um, there are games where you need to be like pokemon go because it's an completely server-side game people
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.640]   Really understanding of it. Yeah, but they seem to be doing it just for piracy which to me is pessimistic
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.240]   Yeah, when they talked to shigeru my amoto
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.200]   um, he did an interview
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.160]   and uh
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.040]   Let me see if I can uh find the uh the actual interview because if you scroll down where they ask him
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.600]   I think it's unashable. Yeah, mashable did the interview at the very end of it
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.720]   He says security
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:11.480]   And then I love it because the guy is doing the interview says by security you mean piracy?
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.120]   He says yes
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.680]   So it isn't it isn't it's not for your benefit
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.320]   So he says I learned today super mario who is I should give him credit because this is the interviewer adam rosenberg on mashable
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.520]   He says I learned today super mario run requires an internet connection to play
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:34.440]   What's the reason for that? And he thoughts about an offline mode and then shigeru goes through a fairly uh circuitous
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.920]   um
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:43.320]   Justification he spins it for us. We view our softwares being a very important asset also for consumers who are purchasing the game
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.920]   We want to make sure we're able to offer it to them in a way. This software is secure
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   They're able to play in a stable environment
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   And then he goes on for more paragraphs and and finally
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:15.320]   Vali developers, I think they spoke about it at one point they have massive piracy rates anyone who tries to make a non free games
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:21.160]   You know what does that mean though? I don't understand the side loads of of it. Yeah people crack it and especially chinese
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.440]   Third party app stores in jailbroke and iphones
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.680]   It's that's very common. You basically jailbreak the iphone download third party stores and then download a whole bunch of cracked apps
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.880]   And sometimes they have malware on it. So it's a huge security risk as well
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.560]   But that's just that's just part of the industry
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.160]   But I think it's the same thing as hdcp. That's for hdcp
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:48.120]   Digital copyright protection is that it ends up affecting normal people more than it does the pirates because they figure out ways around it
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.440]   And you're stuck on an airplane not able to play your mario
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.880]   Yeah, you'll play something else, but that's bad for them because they want you to enjoy their game
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.720]   Yeah, any piracy is oh, I think it's always a bad idea and it's it comes from this
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.360]   You know
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.800]   You're looking through the window and all the people playing your gamehood didn't pay for it and you go
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.480]   I want to I should be making five 99 for each one of those
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.200]   And I think partly you could say those people would never have paid for in the first place
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.760]   And you're come on
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.800]   Most iPhone users maybe not in china
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.240]   But most iPhone users everywhere else do not jailbreak their iphone and buy from off brand stores
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.040]   That's red that is a security issue
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.560]   Yep, so maybe he's right when he says security
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:32.520]   So if it's online they can check and say what did I is this legitimate?
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.800]   Yeah, I mean it's similar plug one go where I think it just you won't serve parts of the game if it's not online and
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:45.160]   Authorized yeah, but I most think server connection. So why wouldn't the the stolen one be authorized?
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.480]   It depends like so again a lot they can put a lot of assets on the server
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.880]   I don't know exactly what they're doing. You never really spoken about it
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.280]   You can put a lot of thing the Chinese pirates do is they go oh let's flip that bit
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.320]   Well, it's the same thing like they they they put a copper protection on your DVD meanwhile
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.720]   There are people on boats in the harbor making thousands of copies of the DVD. Yeah, yeah instantly
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.360]   Well, I want to play it now the the chair. I'm saying well the only thing wrong with the uh
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.800]   On rails always running thing is you can't go back and pick up items you missed which is what I by the way
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.240]   That's how I play Mario. Oh, I missed it. Oh, I missed that and I never get anywhere because and then I die
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.080]   That'd be a version two where you can go left. I mean all this stuff gets fixed
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.400]   I know I'm actually thinking this is the Mario for people like me. Just don't worry about it
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.120]   It's like life. You can't go back and fix it
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.040]   Just you're always moving. Let's go. Let's go
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:48.520]   I was not a I'm not of a vintage that would appreciate that. It's your age group
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.240]   Yeah, I grew up with the two people in their 30s. How about you Andy? Are you a Mario
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.480]   fan?
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.680]   No, my family couldn't afford like a video game console
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.880]   And so I never really got bit by that god. I'm gonna cry
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:08.920]   I know it's not terrible. I used to go to my friend's house where he'd have an Atari 2600 and must have felt terrible
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.240]   I know poor little match boy
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.160]   I was a fully grown adult
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.280]   And so I bought my Atari 2600
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.200]   and uh
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:26.040]   And I but I but I but I think when when did when did the NES when a Mario emerge was in the mid 80s 85
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.480]   86
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.200]   Something like that. Yeah. I didn't I was I remember donkey Kong as a kid
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.120]   Yeah, I remember donkey pong and the coin op
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.320]   Yeah, talk about your nap purchases. I played that one a lot of quarters lost
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.960]   Well, anyway, see nothing but good news. You've got airpods on order
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.080]   Uh yours are going to come before christmas minor going to come they say january 12th
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:57.480]   Although lately apple's been sneaking it out a little sooner, right? That's like uh under under promise over deliver
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.120]   and uh, so i'm hopeful and then uh, you know mario and
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.760]   and uh and good
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:12.200]   Wonderful cheerful happy mac break weekly. We love everything
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:20.680]   You're exactly like you're exactly like when jeremy car clarks and starts the starts his segment by saying people people
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.960]   Complain that we only we never seem to review normal cars under our condition
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.080]   So i'm going to be reviewing the new toyota superer
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.920]   kind of
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.280]   Kind of survive a 2000 foot fall. I am jeremy clarkson
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:40.040]   Some say he was born the old new practical. I haven't watched the new one. Is it good
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.080]   The first one was all right the second one. Yeah, the second one. I didn't like uh
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:51.240]   Well, it's not the same is it? It's not even it's not like top cure. It's a different kind of second one. They want they were like commandos
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.480]   It was very confusing
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.160]   The it's a it's a good series the third the third the third one was was pretty good
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.760]   My problem is that now now we're starting to get into like platform lock-in where
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.800]   Amazon is not willing to create a video player for every single platform
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:15.080]   So I actually had to like dig out my uh, amazon firestick from whatever box it was in
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.840]   And plug it into find a tv that had an open like hdmi port
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.920]   Just so I could watch this one show and as i'm doing this
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.440]   I've got like the youtube app
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:31.720]   Which is like the default app on all of my different players and thinking if I just wanted to if I just decided to watch one of the pirated versions
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   Of it that was uploaded to youtube slightly slowed down so that the sense so that the copyright sensors couldn't find it
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.320]   I would have already seen this eight times, but no I have to create
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.040]   You know, it's it's true of all i'm really becoming a an anti-fan
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:55.160]   Of exclusive content if that exclusive content isn't like netflix or youtube where you have you have to have special hardware to watch it on your tv
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.080]   By the way, I just love it every time I hear
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:08.040]   Anybody say amazon firestick. I feel like you should sing amazon firestick good. Yeah, I think in a post galaxy in a world
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.280]   You don't want that as your brand fire stick
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:18.600]   Long live on kindle. You have my audio karsten because I before we go to the break. I just thought it'd be kind of fun to hear
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.760]   Shigeru Maya mochmiyamoto and the roots
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.920]   Performing
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.480]   Look at it. Look at he's playing the guitar
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.360]   That mario never said it's so good
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.160]   Oh, that's
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:43.800]   It's going going youtube and just spend hours listening to mario covers some of them are just incredible
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.600]   It's so it's so cool to see this it's great it's great music. It's like such an iconic
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.720]   To be felons going by
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:31:01.640]   Questlove it has a little uh, it looks like a little Mario Lego Mario hard on
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.160]   I'm just a
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.040]   I think it's cool that miyamoto can play
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.200]   Mario theme on a guitar
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.440]   Not just a pretty facial not just a pretty face they say don't meet your heroes, but there are
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:25.160]   Isn't he the guy that nintendo won't let drive himself because he's so
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.600]   He's so valuable
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.840]   To the company that
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.520]   They no no no no shigeru we're gonna send the car for you
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.040]   You may not drive
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.760]   Jeremy Clarkson is no James may is right. You'll get there very soon
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:48.200]   If poo if poo has a list of like 30 people that he is willing to kidnap to encourage like Russian interests
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.920]   I believe that he would be on that new burrow uno. Yeah, just don't let the stick drive him. That would be bad
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.840]   The stick
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.400]   All right show that's the thing with the stick by the way. He's gone, right?
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.480]   There's no stick there's some obnoxious american
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.800]   They could deliberately obnoxious american driver and they can't do the celebrities in the cheap car
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.720]   So they keep saying the celebrities coming on, but then they have an accident and can't actually show up
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.800]   That's why i'm very frustrating. That's pretty funny
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.960]   Well, at least they're Charlie's tarrant got eaten by a lion. I mean, it's just it keeps going
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.520]   All right show that they brought to you by a great holiday gift i'm bringing this out
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.920]   I hope mom don't listen if you're listening put your hands over your ears bringing this out to mom

[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.400]   video
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.080]   Doorbell because she's 83 and when the doorbell rings she's always home
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.680]   That's not the problem. It's just that she shouldn't have to get up
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   And go to the door if it's somebody she doesn't want to talk to so now with a ring video doorbell. We'll pay i'm also bringing her by the way
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.160]   Some heroes
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:51.240]   I'm it's gonna be a tech day the first day i go out and visit the doorbell the heroes and an amazon dot
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:57.320]   She's gonna have the whole thing and i'm gonna set it all up for but this is cool because she she already has an iphone
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:04.040]   And she can look at our iphone and see who's at the door because the the ring video doorbell has a camera and hd camera on
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:10.280]   So but it's even more than that because you can answer the door from anywhere in the world the the ring video doorbell pears
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.440]   to your internet
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:18.040]   And then uh when somebody rings your bell or even just comes up the wall because it has a motion sensor as well
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   You can see them you can get notified you can talk to them. That's got a speaker and they can talk to you. It's got a microphone
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.000]   This is the best iot device ever invented
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.520]   And they have 23 million americans have had packages stolen from their home last year
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.840]   This time of year is the worst time of all. There's always somebody coming to your door. There's always something on your doorstep
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.480]   You can keep an eye
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   On your stuff somebody yesterday in the chatroom sent me a link
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.200]   Oh, thank you. CCC has sent it again from kptv
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.400]   in Oregon city
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.720]   That uh caught on camera
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:03.240]   Woman steals package off or is in Oregon city porch. You know what why they caught it on camera?
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.040]   Ring the ring video doorbell
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:11.960]   There she is. There she is. She's stealing it. We caught you. We got you busted
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.760]   please uh
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.640]   Have now have a description and they're looking for her and her suv
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.800]   Wow, wow if you want to get on television
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:32.440]   Go go borrow a package from somebody's porch that has a ring video doorbell. I love the ring right now you get the ring a security kit
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.160]   And get a hundred fifty up to a hundred fifty dollars off when you visit ring.com/macbreak
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.920]   So there's two rings is the ring and the ring pro. I have the original ring
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.960]   That's got a big battery and it's so you don't have to have a wired doorbell
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.640]   But if you have a wired doorbell get the ring pro
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.480]   That's uh, this a lot it's slimmer because it doesn't need a battery and
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.040]   It has a 1080p camera. So it's a little bit higher res as well
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.880]   The original ring is 720p which I find more than adequate to catch
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.040]   Kids who are dashing dinging and dashing. What is it dong and dash?
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.440]   Uh
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   ditch dong and ditch
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.760]   Dinging dong ditch
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.680]   Ding dong ditch and okay anyway if somebody's ding dong ditching you you'll have video of it
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.280]   The basic kit includes the doorbell and with every kit you get the sign the lighted sign that
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.760]   Get solar power gets charged up during the day. The sign's nice because it kind of warns people
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.640]   Hey, i'm keeping an eye on things. They also have the stick up cam, which is a ring video doorbell minus
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.600]   The doorbell
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.240]   So it can go any part of your house. It's completely wireless
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.840]   Because it's not only is it Wi-Fi but it comes with the stick up cam's
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:45.560]   Uh solar panel which charges it during the day and it runs all night both the ring doorbell and the stick up cam have
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.480]   Night vision by the way and they're both wireless and waterproof
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.280]   So you can and by the way the stick up cam. I love it has a speaker and a microphone too

[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.120]   Like any parts they could like resistive displays knob driven displays a few capacitive ones
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.200]   But the latest generation are getting good
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.440]   It's it's a glacial industry where yeah, I think that the wireless carplay was announced the year
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.280]   Maybe two years ago and might cut you up in cars next year or the year after
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.200]   Um, but there's a lot more of them. So you can go to the website in fact
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   I would before you buy the car
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.160]   Because a lot of times you get to the dealership and they're not they're really kind of clueless. Yeah, yeah sure you can use your uh
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.360]   I found a problem
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:54.520]   Your car plays plays fine. It's fine. What do you want? I've got four tires. You can sell you a cassette adapter for only $90
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.080]   Exactly like a track, but with bits
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.960]   So, you know, it's not true everywhere
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.280]   There are a lot there are some really good salespeople out there who will know exactly what you're talking about
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.120]   But I think it's best to be
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.280]   Prepared go to the apple website. They've launched
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.080]   uh now 15 new models a number of 2017 models
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:20.440]   And uh some other stuff that jeep compass will be the first jeep to come with a carplay the 2017 jeep compass the 25
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.520]   17 BMW 5 series sedan
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.840]   Um
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.000]   With wireless carplay built in that's kind of cool. So is it what is usually wired?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.960]   Yeah, the original version you had to connect to lightning
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.800]   Uh in order for it to sort of take over and power the car the new one is work over bluetooth
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:41.880]   Now what about what do you think of this? This is uh sony's making a carplay display that you can buy
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:49.320]   499 I love the aftermarket stuff because you know, I got my car the year before they started offering it and you can't upgrade a car
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.280]   I mean we get upset when we can't array our computers, but the no, sorry
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.600]   You want that you gotta buy the new car dashboard
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.960]   2017 is not compatible with dashboard 2016 sucker
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   Uh, so any of the aftermarket stuff I thought is I think it's extremely useful if it's if it'll it'll fit in your in your
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.880]   Sort of cabin. It's big too. It's got a 6.4 inch display
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.640]   Yeah, voice control with apple carplay it does andrade auto too. I think because
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.560]   Yeah, why not? It's hard. It's hard to find any manufacturer
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:24.280]   Not not just of cars, but even of a third party head units that have decided to be exclusive one of the other
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.920]   They really want to make sure that no matter what you have in your pocket when you walk into that car
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.080]   It's going to work with whatever they've got in that dashboard. So that's I wonder if that's one of the reasons why
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.920]   We haven't been seeing either company google or apple super aggressively promoting it
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   Uh, the way that they promote a lot of their other product lines because it seems as though they they can't get really a tactical advantage
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.160]   all they can do is
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.560]   Get parody with with the competition
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.400]   We got 10.2 yesterday
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.840]   We did and we got the new t. Oh, you didn't
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.480]   I didn't get the new tv app. I got the 10 point. I saw you going over the new emoji leo
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.040]   Played with an emoji and ios today
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.600]   I was clown is terrifying. Is that one of the new ones because it is very scary
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.840]   Yeah, the clown is terrified the cowboy is just kind of rude, but the clown is terrifying
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:20.520]   Yeah, okay, see because I I'm not so emoji literate that I knew immediately
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.480]   Which were new emojis and which weren't so
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.360]   Some of the new faces like the laughing crying on an angle face is new. There's a bunch of bloggers
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.240]   But leo we've been left out because there are no gray haired bloggers. I mean, it's it's totally it's totally
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.520]   They do have some gray haired jobs, don't they?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.240]   I they have santa and I think old people
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.080]   And busboy at denny's
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.920]   Yes, yes, no, there's a lot of professional emoji. There's a lot of they've gender balanced a lot of the emojis
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.960]   So there's a lot of you know both male and female versions now get you a terrifying clown and cowboy face
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.480]   uh, there
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:00.200]   I'm sending this out a bunch of you food. That is just scary as hell bacon. Yay
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.160]   yep, yep and and apples
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.280]   um
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.880]   emojis now are
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.080]   kind of um
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.880]   More refoto realist a little more photorealistic they redrew almost all of them and they made them
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.400]   Cleaner and more vivid. Yeah, oh, I like that one
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:21.240]   There's a shrug. You don't have to do the little ASCII shrug art anymore like an animal. You can use an actual shrug emoji. Yeah
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:27.080]   I guess there's no protein. I mean sadly, but hopefully that'll be the next scene goes back
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:35.960]   Don't worry citizen and international tribunal has provided you with this list of approved emotions that you're allowed to express to one another
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.320]   Don't make up some of your own if you're not
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.480]   One one will be provided for you
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:48.200]   Um, a sense of fender you're all sense of there's a pregnant woman. There's a pickle
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:55.720]   Uh, there's a salad. I like the salad. That's very helpful looking
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.240]   But doesn't that I mean it really looks really looks good enough to eat
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.440]   Well, I mean part of emoji usually came from Japan
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.280]   So they were heavily skewed towards japanese cultures
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.800]   They had like rice balls and and all sorts of of cuisine that you would find
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.680]   All through japan, but you wouldn't find as common or you'd find very different things in north america. Oh
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:18.200]   Christmas that's good. Look at that. Yeah. Yeah, it has to be it has to be universal, right?
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.040]   Yeah
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   That's why no classic language. Yeah
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.560]   Man and tuxedo with mustache same color as flesh
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.200]   prince
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.920]   Face palm is one i'll be using a lot and you can get face palm in either male or female
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:38.520]   I'm waiting for the double face palm shrug again, uh gender neutral
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:46.040]   Astronauts all the professions thanks to google who really pushed hard for this have both male and female
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.600]   Um
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.440]   equivalence teacher
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.240]   I remember when jeremy stopped by from emoji pedia. He was oh the technologist has a mac of course
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:01.880]   Because it's a well the apples rendering. Yeah, this is so every company doesn't isn't that sad that they all have the old max
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.000]   The old back books with all that aluminum
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.240]   Wow, we gotta we gotta get to where we'll say apple has the best glass of whiskey have all the
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.960]   Class of whiskey emojis apple really nailed it. It's the good stuff firefighter now
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.840]   There was some controversy over the farmer because she's growing carrots
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.480]   And apparently that's pretty western
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:24.440]   Uh, whoa singer. That's a boey tribute. And this singer parts her hair on the right
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.840]   Not the last one also. Yes. I'm also gem. She's totally outrageous. Yeah, gem
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:37.560]   Gem, awesome g factory worker. She's totally outraged. Just gimme the holograms. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm not hip like you guys
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.200]   Gem jem artists
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.880]   We are the misfits our songs are better
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.880]   Which was actually kind of true
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.280]   I hate to say it. I mean they were they were mean people but there's the lying face the panochio emoji
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.960]   Here's a sneezing face with suspicious kill some
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.320]   Punch in the nose. It looks like ghost punch in the nose
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:07.480]   Truly is not good. I'm not going to use that one rolling on the floor laughing is actually kind of rolling
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:12.360]   And laughing being attacked by slugs cowboy here comes here comes get ready
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.960]   Brace yourself scary clown. I know terrible. You know we look at filmmakers and I started looking at the different
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.600]   Emoji for clowns across platforms and they're all terrifying. There's no way to make a clown not so terrifying
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.240]   I think that clown looked like I could eat it like a clown cake. Maybe like I would get it
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:34.440]   It looked like the clown or will we can sweater carvel in that photo. Yes, exactly left face left face
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.920]   So you can go a fist bump fist. Oh
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.720]   I was wondering oh
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:45.800]   See oh and they say call me, but I think it could be hang loose bra. Yeah. Yeah, that's hang loose bra
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.440]   selfie
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:53.800]   Might one throw the goat by emoji or is our we still living in pavement times? I don't think we have that yet
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.640]   Shark. Oh, that's a apple again is really in some of these very photo realistic the duck
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.920]   Uh, that was no jumping the shark though. No, she said yeah. Well, I wish there were maybe we could make that
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.000]   You know you can combine emojis in unusual in different ways. Yeah, there's a gecko
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.240]   A bat
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.760]   Gecko gecko a bat
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.640]   I like the bat
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.280]   I'm throwing pokeballs at all of these and they go by Leo just so that you're
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.760]   They do look a little like pokemon, don't they?
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:27.080]   Renasiris the squid was very interesting. I don't know if that was anatomically correct fox face
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:32.520]   These are all the new ones sure where's where's the trash panda?
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:38.120]   This is all courtesy of emoji pedia with a scroll of all of the new emojis
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:44.360]   There are quite a few like god just think about how much money this would have cost as clip art back when the mac two came out
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.600]   On a cd it doesn't scale though that big right? I mean they they kind of get a little blurry as you
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.400]   Get a big egg
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.440]   They didn't have a catching a baby is it hatching a baby?
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.840]   What did you do if you're on twitter and you didn't have an icon?
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:05.080]   I know I'm gonna use the oh, I'm gonna use the egg emoji as my twitter image. Oh brilliant
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.400]   Yeah, that'll confuse a lot of people
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.800]   The kiwi fruits the avocado emoji is getting a lot of attention
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.440]   I'm not sure now this shallow pan of food is clearly paella, but apparently it was fairly controversial
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.480]   Because in some countries in some areas they don't put shrimp in their paella that avocado
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.840]   Man, that looks good. Oh and brown liquor
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.720]   Some kind very and they restored the peach to the bum proxy that it was meant to be
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.400]   Yeah, so originally they took the bottom out and they put the bottom of the peach
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:37.240]   They put the bottom back and i'm glad because you need something
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.000]   Are they are they that sophisticated? I actually wonder if they're thinking okay
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.920]   No, we're going to have to have something that is not actually a weir
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.240]   There was there was a intended to use as they did reverse angle on the eggplant though
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:56.440]   So there was an uproar there was an uproar if you want some if you're gonna do smudgy texting you've got to have
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.800]   the proper emojis exactly and
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:05.880]   At this point in a part of a relationship there are quite a few emojis you could use like the carrot
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.640]   But it's kind of widely agreed now. There's bacon
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.280]   Tasty that I think that there's kind of a common understanding
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.080]   wrestlers
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:22.280]   And we don't mix sexes when we wrestle fencing with an orange dot so they won't get shot by police
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.000]   Handball what that's not handball. That's what is that?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.960]   Person doing cartwheel
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.480]   That's questionable
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.520]   I would not think i would i would think something vulgar, but i wouldn't think
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.400]   Part wheel juggling
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.840]   Here's the karate kid all you see someone's punching the juggler that's
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.240]   Do kind of the only had a mime i could punch goal net
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.960]   Goal
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:59.080]   Your number one and it's gold your number two and it's silver
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.440]   Your number three and it's bronze who was going to send a bronze medal
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.440]   to somebody
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.240]   That was middle level management. Nice try but
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.920]   Solid drum. I like the vespa. That's a nice vespa
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:21.640]   apple clearly had some aspirations to live like those javita scooter a canoe
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.520]   shopping cart
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:29.320]   Uh, I must be I must be hungry because everything's making me hungry
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.200]   Time for lunch. Oh black heart
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.160]   What would you use that for? Oh
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.720]   black heart
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:44.760]   That's like I love you, but I hate you. Yeah. Thank you emoji. That's that's that's but it's that is fascinating
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:51.880]   It's it's so as if you're trying to create a new alphabet and we know that or excuse me the people who are responsible for maintaining the emoji archive
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.600]   Have to know that this is it's we can't just
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:02.040]   Have things that are positive and uplifting and that are good for society that we approve of because this is a mode of communication that people are going to be using
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.640]   People are going to like be responding if people are going to
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:12.120]   Find out that their spouse is cheating on them and then send hateful text to them using emojis
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.360]   There's going to have to be coverage for that sort of thing
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:20.920]   It's if if not to the to the extent of having you know a knife piercing a human heart and blood squishing everywhere
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.640]   You gotta have a black symbol heart. You have to have
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.880]   you know
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.280]   pentagram and
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.880]   goats with horns otherwise otherwise don't pretend that you're trying to help people communicate because
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.040]   You have to people sometimes people have all kinds of feelings inside
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:43.240]   And when you have bad feelings inside, it's good to let them out, but just remember
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:51.000]   You don't have to be destructive when you do that you can you can do it in a responsible way or you can send her a pickle
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.520]   And actually the emoji pedia people speculate
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.120]   That this might put the eggplant out of business. I don't know
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:03.000]   I'm invested an eggplant Leo. I made a mistake with dungarees over jeans and i'm not gonna do it again
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.080]   There is a pregnant one we showed that yeah the pregnant woman now they there was gonna be one for breastfeeding which
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.800]   uh was weirdly controversial because
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.520]   Jeremy also told me this he's from the emoji emoji community and the fatter emoji pia
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.560]   That um they did want it to be gender neutral
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.800]   But they didn't want to go so far as to have a male breastfeeding as well as a female breastfeeding
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.440]   So they just cut the head off
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.960]   So it's a headless torso breastfeeding a
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:37.880]   Ambiguously uh gendered torso the pregnant one is single gendered
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:45.640]   I was thinking about that too men can apparently can nurse but he told me this men some men can nurse but not no man
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.360]   To date can get pregnant
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.840]   But thanks to medicine
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.600]   So fix that
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   Well, that's not that's not necessarily
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.520]   True
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:01.400]   Okay, so reasons for reasons that are not that are not medical but are very very complex
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.040]   Right you could be cisgender you could be a man
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:09.000]   But have the capability of very child that's right and be a man
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.880]   I don't know because this is a wonderful and because this is a wonderful year 20 of all the awful things that have happened in 2016 there's
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:25.880]   Unless there's a there's a impetus to point things out like that. I will be using the wilting rose frequently
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:31.400]   Beauty and the beast or the the tellers shadow trick. Yes
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.960]   emoji
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.200]   Well, we've we've now really uh is there anything else in 10.2? We should mention this
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:46.680]   There's no a new effect in the tv app for american and the tv app the tv app which which amongst other things has this really good
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:55.480]   Like singles single sign in for multiple services, which in itself makes hope it makes it on apple tv sooner rather than later
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:02.200]   Uh, and of course the ability to simply have all the content from all of your services that provide video in one hopper
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.800]   As opposed to here are icons you can use to launch apps that will find content for you
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:13.080]   The ability to have a dashboard that's a little bit more alike what you get when you sign on to the sling service
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.280]   Here are all the shows that are on right now. Here's the content that's available to you regardless of wherever they are
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.520]   Uh, can you see this? I don't have my I should get my iPad I show you
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.680]   Um
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.920]   Because uh, it's kind of this is kind of small
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.400]   Welcome to the tv app and by the way, if you up to 10.2, you don't have to download the tv app
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.080]   It just appears magically because it's replacing videos. So
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.880]   Basically, this is the new videos
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.160]   Which is important to know because when I first heard about it
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.760]   I thought oh, this is just for streaming services, but it also includes
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.400]   all the things you've purchased
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.920]   And anything you have in your video library on your device here will do on my iPad here
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.560]   It's a little bit like the music app for video. Yeah
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.800]   Update your carrier. I people tv there it is
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.200]   so um
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.240]   Yeah, the big the big missing feature of course is Netflix
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.000]   Uh, but you do have cross cross service
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.640]   Searching which is nice, right?
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:17.240]   Uh, single sign on that's huge if it had Netflix there's a few services that are not here yet
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   So I don't know what the hold up is
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:26.040]   Some of them just don't want to see you control or interface or yeah
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.480]   Yeah, but also they there could be a problem with metrics where okay
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.640]   Do we get to know who is asking for what and where you're steering us?
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.520]   Yeah, it's very contentious. There's there's a there's a lot of kind of juvenile stuff going on
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.360]   Uh with the deployment of uh of apps as we were discussing earlier
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.280]   So and here's my library all the tv shows I purchased so in a way
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.120]   Somebody's kind of like iTunes as well, right because you would see this in the iTunes store
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.440]   Um, but that's nice so I can now have and then what is watch now?
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.160]   Uh, do oh if you have video apps
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.680]   Yeah, then you will it will show up they'll show up here hulu stars show time hm
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.720]   It's a big problem they had is that you could find things that were available
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.240]   But you didn't know what was just playing now like they had a sort of tv guide problem
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.240]   And this is an attempt to solve that
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.840]   Yeah, I think if you don't know what you want to watch if you know what you want to watch you were fine
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.520]   If you didn't know it was very hard to browse around browse around and because that's a weird thing
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.360]   Like you can have a bunch of DVDs on a shelf or download in a directory and you'll go no no no no
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.280]   Then you'll turn on tv and cable and something's just playing that you said no to five minutes ago
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.040]   You're like, oh, that's playing already
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.560]   And then you just sit there and watch it and that we didn't have a digital equivalent of that
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.240]   Well, i'm sorry you don't have this in one day
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:44.840]   The rights thing is just a mess that you know, just like the drm copy protection thing
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.400]   Doesn't disadvantage
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.680]   Bad guys only real users the rights thing
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:56.120]   It it you know, it's that's a shame anyway. They really they really are a real estate world
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.760]   Yeah, it's a relic exactly what it is
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:05.080]   Now what we still want of course is live television on here and that's something apple has yet to be able to make those deals although
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:10.120]   uh less moon vases cbs said that he has made a deal with
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:15.160]   Who was it to do streaming? I think it was it 18 t somebody
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.360]   apple is in talks with hollywood however to get some get movies
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.040]   On itunes sooner like a two-week advantage
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:31.240]   Or no, i'm sorry two weeks after the debut of the movie. Well, that would be nice. I presume that would be to purchase. Yeah
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:37.400]   Yeah, I think it was super expensive or at least the talk the talk would not do it 25 to 50 dollars
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.000]   As well. There was a system if you remember like it was a couple of years ago
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.560]   And they would come to your house and put this retina scan and you could retina scan and it paid 500 bucks to see
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.560]   Day and date movies and that just didn't go anywhere not surprisingly
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.560]   So this kind of sort of solved that problem
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.960]   It's also a problem where no matter even if it's the during a deal with apple
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.800]   They make a huge
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.960]   They're their their money vault comes from first run actual movie theaters and
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.360]   Previously when a company has tried to do a major release this way
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:12.200]   By it's going to release in theaters and we'll also have it available for a limited for even for like a one-day screening available
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.760]   on netflix or on some streaming service
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:20.840]   The theater chain said well guess what we're not screening your movie and so instead of opening in 4 000 theaters
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:26.920]   It's opening in like 500 theaters and it's such a money pit that they were dissuaded from going on again
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.000]   So there's going to be a lot of diplomacy that has to be done if they can actually make that work
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.400]   Let's take a break more coming with Andy and Akko Chicago Sun times Renee richy i'more.com
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:41.080]   Mac break weekly the cheerful version brought to you today
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:46.200]   By tracker actually I was brought to you today by tracker because had I not found my keys
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:53.240]   Only to open the garage door and find a pile of dirt in front of it. I would not have made it here at all fortunately
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.520]   I have a tracker on my keys
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.320]   Tracker is the quarter-sized
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.720]   This is the tracker bravo
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.760]   Device that you could put on anything you would lose put it in your luggage put it on your remote control put it on your dog
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:14.280]   Your cat your keys anything that you would lose and then you pair it to your phone. It's bluetooth le
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.720]   That's low energy so it doesn't suck battery life, but it does give you a location
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:24.280]   Uh, where you know where this tracker is whatever it's attached to you name it of course
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.440]   So you know what it is that your tracker is tracking
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.920]   I love this solution and this is the best of the bluetooth trackers
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.120]   You know some of the other ones the battery does you have to throw it out the tracker
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.240]   It's easy to
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:38.280]   You pop it up and put a new battery in there affordable and expensive
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:44.360]   From the drugstore and and you're going again you're back online tracker last because of bluetooth
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.800]   They'll be about a year
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:51.320]   Although I turn on some of the more there are things you can do that are more energy intensive like I like the two
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:57.240]   Way separation alerts. So if I leave my keys behind my phone howls if I leave my phone behind
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.880]   The tracker beeps at me
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:04.440]   So you you much less likely leave your phone behind and then there's a button on the tracker that you push in it
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.040]   Makes your phone beep too. It's kind of like find your phone, but it works on any phone
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:14.440]   It really is a great idea tracker has also been such a success four and a half million
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.840]   Trackers out there now
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.680]   That they have this incredible thing that no one else can duplicate the tracker
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.160]   Crowd gps network in fact. I love this on the website
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.120]   It starts on a 11 11 and goes through today
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.680]   You can see the growth of the trackers you can see they're selling like 100 000 a week
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   So you can see as the tracker
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.040]   Crowd gps gets even better and better and better. You see here's the deal
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.400]   You leave your keys with the tracker attached behind
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:48.360]   And you can look on your phone to see the last place your phone saw
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:52.520]   But if you get outside of bluetooth rage more than 100 feet away your phone stops updating
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.280]   But don't worry. So maybe picks up your keys brings into the lost and found
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.120]   Anybody with the tracker software running who walks by will see it
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.520]   And notify your software that they where they saw the keys
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.160]   So all of these blue dots
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.480]   And by the way, these are blue dots all over the world all of these blue dots
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:15.160]   Are helping you i'm helping
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:20.680]   The density in europe is amazing. I mean there's it's it's covered
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   And there's nowhere you can go in europe that you won't you won't get a somebody saying hey, I see your keys
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:31.240]   Even Moscow all over the world tracker is a huge success
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:37.560]   I want you to go to the tracker t h e t r a c k r the tracker dot com

[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.680]   Today 4.5 million just really they're doing great guns
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.240]   calendar spam
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.080]   We talked about it
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.240]   Apple has been working on a solution. They now have a report junk option
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.880]   They're dealing with spam in your calendar very much like you would deal with email spam
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.160]   Giving you the tools to report it and then help everybody else kind of block it
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.960]   I think that this pretty much signals the end as it has it gone away calendar spam. Are you still
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.840]   Yeah, it has for me. Yeah, this is this solution is a great idea. So if some I never
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.720]   I never had it but for people are telling me they people did have it have seen a significant
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   Not complete reduction of it. Yeah
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:57.400]   So apple first response was to talk to people who are getting calendar spam get the information from them
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.080]   Start blocking these spammers and now there's a tool that's built in that you can report junk
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.040]   Meanwhile, I had to scroll through nine different spam google docs to get to the show notes today
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:14.280]   But i'm not better really getting google doc spam now google doc spam for weeks and weeks and you know what not a single headline
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.560]   Not a single statement from google not a single fix in the work
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.720]   Nobody cares when it's google
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.000]   It's better about it. Yeah, because you can send an invitation to somebody if you know they're a google address
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.080]   Yeah, and it adds a folder right there
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.760]   That's it
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.160]   Yeah, and I get folders and folders filled with cheap parts from china for every conceivable thing
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.880]   They're smart
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.600]   Yeah, uh is mr. Cook on his way to trump tower tomorrow
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.040]   Supposedly so all the all the CEOs
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.400]   Yep
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.400]   They
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.240]   Google's gonna be there facebook's gonna be there
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.120]   Um, I don't know if dasos is gonna be there that would be in that would be an interesting
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.480]   Confrontation given that he also owns the washington post that has been rather
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.400]   Well, but I think there's always a risk when you go to meet with mr
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.760]   Trump that he'll uh chew you out for something because he's mad at apple
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.600]   Remember he said boycott apple boy caught and then he said and we want you to bring your uh
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.400]   Bring your all your manufacturing back in the united states. I imagine that will come up
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.320]   Yeah, they're they just say after you mr. Trump's they they give that as a response
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:33.640]   Yeah, I have to remember he had us and remember he had a similar summit with uh electronic news organizations to sort of get to get to know me
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.200]   Now that i'm the president now the president elect and supposedly it was
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.880]   One person who was there who did not want to be identified referred to as a bloodbath book the heads of cnn
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:51.000]   He's calling cnn that hey there you're you published nothing but lies your disgrace you're horrible like, okay
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.480]   This is going to be a fun four years is it not
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.200]   So meanwhile, but meanwhile you have
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:02.920]   With it with this little summit on wednesday. He's going to have a room full of people who are richer than he is
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:09.000]   more successful than he is who um uh operate on who
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.480]   Perhaps aren't quite so dependent on his largesse for continuing operations
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:22.280]   Because he can certainly do things to screw up lots of industries, but he has less power over tim cook
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.440]   Then he might have over the head of cnn
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.680]   Uh, he you know, he he's not the there is no there's no fcc that controls
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.800]   Whether or not the whether or not apple can stay in business
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.160]   So it could be i'm really looking forward to seeing
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.800]   Reports of what happened inside there and also you have you have all these tech leaders who none of whom
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:48.120]   Really like stood by trump's oh, yes. Well, we we have no opinion on trump. Yeah, hooray
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.600]   It's always we have we are shocked. We are horrified. Yeah by thing x-play tim cook particularly
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.520]   That's going to be an interesting conversation with the exception of peter teal and a few others
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.000]   Uh, silica valley was pretty much pro
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.360]   uh clinton
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   Right now peter teal is
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.040]   Inside teal is in fact the one who issued the invitations to the ceos
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.680]   There was some thought that ela musk would be going and then the last i heard is he couldn't go there a few
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.680]   CEOs declined because of schedule right out of charge
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:22.680]   Yeah, i was kind of stuck right in chest here of air bnb said he wasn't going to go uh uber's travis calon
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.080]   um
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   But it's going to be it is interesting because he has a carrot as well as a stick he
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.560]   Has talked about re you know repatriating giving a deal if they'll repatriate their money
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.080]   Held overseas apple has billions overseas would love a lower
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:42.360]   Tax rate or no tax rate on that repatriated money. That's something he can offer them
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:49.800]   Uh, what's what's what's concerning i'm sure to these guys going out there is trump hasn't really shown much affinity or interest in technology
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.200]   I mean he we know he's against net neutrality
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.880]   Uh, i'm not american so i'm confused can he actually do that stuff or is that like senate and congress?
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.040]   Well, he can he can appoint the fcc chairman, right?
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.840]   And so he's already as a matter of fact the democratic uh, chairman the fcc
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   Well, i meant like the tax stuff is all like
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:16.600]   The tax stuff, uh, no i think not but the remember he has a republic in congress so the the congress is
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:23.160]   majority in both houses of congress is held by the same party as the president elect so
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.560]   At least initially i mean it'll be interesting to see but at least initially i think they're going to rubber stamp whatever he wants
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:36.440]   And let's face it. This is a pro a very pro business very pro business congress and a very pro pro business president
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:43.160]   So on in that respect at least i think silicon valley probably, uh, you know is interested. This is my
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.240]   This isn't three-dimensional chess anymore. This is four-dimensional. It's very complicated
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.880]   Yeah, because because we have we have already seen
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:57.080]   Really active pushback from what is going to be republican controlled congress against trump on several specific issues
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.760]   Uh particularly because the republican majority is
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:07.560]   It's there, but it's kind of slim. So really all that has to happen is if just a couple of senators turn their votes
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.000]   They're on a certain issue that all goes away
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:19.880]   And there is a lot of i'm talking as a political expert who actually just reads a lot of things he finds from legitimate news news sources
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:26.120]   But there's there it doesn't seem to be the same sort of like hey great. We're all one party
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:31.800]   We are all great. We are the executive branch and we are the legislative branch and soon will be the judicial judicial branch
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:37.720]   Hopefully with some more appointments. There is we don't know what this we don't know if this person is
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:43.160]   Has this person has not always been a republican this person has not always
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:51.160]   Spouted what we believe as mainline republican beliefs. We don't know if we should basically believe
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:58.600]   That this guy is going to be our ally or if we need to make sure that we get what we want and we're not
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.000]   We're not sure that we're gonna get that from it's a mystery, you know, and I think that that's one of the reasons
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.800]   First of all the president like calls you usually just respond and say yeah, i'll be there
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.480]   Yeah, that's and with interest because you want to know what's going to happen
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:18.760]   Charles sandberg of facebook will be there not zuckerberg but sandberg of course peter teals on the board at facebook and tim cook
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.840]   satinadella of microsoft larry page of
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.320]   alphabet
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.960]   Actually now i'm looking yeah by the way if you
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.520]   This this is probably too political for us
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:37.800]   But but kara swissher's article in recode as tris as trumpell fin skin lets down his hair for tech shame on silicon valley
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:43.640]   For climbing the tower and silence calls on everybody to just boycott but of course they're all going to go
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:51.880]   um, and I now I see on recode from kara. This is uh as of yesterday elan musk
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.280]   Is in so I don't I just don't know uh, we'll see
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:01.160]   I think it'll be you know what i'm gonna watch with interest as uh the executives go in
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.960]   Tomorrow and as they come out it's very much a reality show
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:13.400]   I mean if that's one thing that's for sure and that's one of the things uh, uh, uh, kara swissher, uh says is
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.600]   Um, she's you know, it's basically you know, you're let's see here
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.640]   You guys know gary bucie right yeah, right?
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.720]   But it's just
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.080]   She she says well one would hope for a substantive discussion is pretty clear to me
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:33.240]   This is just going to be that media saturated geek reality show episode in which real billionaires walk the gauntlet of
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:38.580]   Administration at trump tower and get exactly nothing for handing over their daily so easily. I'm not sure I agree with that
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.420]   I mean, I think that she yeah, I don't I don't agree with either
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:44.100]   She she does she does make a she makes a lot of good points there and also speaks of
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:49.860]   Having talked to some people who are going to be in that room, but she can't speak so they can't speak on the record to her
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:54.740]   Uh, but one of the things that's kind of most I think most important is that this is he
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.020]   This is valuable just for the fact that
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.860]   Uh, the president elect calls for this meeting and all these are incredibly powerful
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:07.700]   Leaders showed up and had this meeting with him and so that helps to legitimize
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.980]   His his transition
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.380]   And I mean, it's it's nothing it's nothing that any
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.340]   Smart president elect would not do
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:22.340]   But if you're concerned if if if you're concerned is that he doesn't he's not going to take these kind of issues seriously
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.540]   But he wants to have that really good picture of him at a table
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:30.020]   On one side of the table with everybody else on the other side of table
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.460]   the in chairs that are about eight inches shorter than his
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.660]   uh as opposed to that that picture of a similar summit that
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:40.340]   Uh, the president obama had where they're basically hey, let's all
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.380]   We're now that we've all finished skiing and snowboarding
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:48.980]   Let's uh have a big cup of coffee around the ski lodge here and have a good chat about the future of technology
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:54.260]   Um, I mean as far as as far as apple's concerned like like I said, this is going to be really
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.980]   Interesting. I really don't know
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.460]   what the agenda is going to be for tim cook inside that room
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.220]   because
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.660]   It's going to be
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.740]   It's going to be a tough tough room. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be saying things that are just so
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:13.140]   Simple and naive, but you have the things that have been said by
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:19.300]   The president elect over the past two years about issues that apple has spoken quite
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.740]   loudly and quite passionately against
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.860]   If if not necessarily specifically against the comments that were made by the president elect
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:32.660]   It's hard to know well great. Now you're four feet away from this person
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:40.900]   And they are they have paused for breath and they there seems to be an opening to respond to some of these things that have been said
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.380]   What do you do?
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:49.140]   I honestly don't know what what uh someone in that position can or should do. I honestly don't
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.620]   Listen, I mean, I think that makes sense
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:56.340]   You definitely you definitely know and I'll be interested to see how forthright they are coming out
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:59.380]   Yeah, because remember the network news anchors
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:03.540]   Refused to say anything in public anyway
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:08.500]   And also and and also with an anonymous person anonymous source saying oh was a bloodbath
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.820]   That could be an been orchestrated by well, what what do we what does one side or the other want to be known?
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.140]   Well, we'll put out the story that this is what happened
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:21.700]   It's as I said, it's oh and they and they have stuff to ask for I mean
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.900]   And he has stuff to ask for silicon valley is absolutely the kind of the engine
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:30.180]   uh for a lot of the innovation and and
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.300]   wealth building in this country plus
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:37.540]   If one of the issues that you ran on is jobs
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.940]   Um, you got to go to silicon valley and and say how are we going to solve this?
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:47.540]   Growing problem is automation kicks more and more people out of jobs. There's more and more jobs are offshred
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:53.460]   You got to talk to these people so see that that that's that's the other difficulty outside of the room or in the in the in the
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:58.900]   In the in the voter place. It's all about well jobs being shipped out of this country to china and to mexico
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.620]   But really it's by factor of something like eight more jobs are amazing
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.620]   Exactly, it's it's automation and it's completely within these people's interests
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:15.300]   Tim cook and else someone in tim tim cook's line can say look if we could if we could we would have to spend
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.100]   1000 years
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.260]   selectively breeding
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:25.700]   a a type of human that is positive that is capable of assembling an iPhone let alone a
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:33.220]   Capable of assembling them and we basically have to also offer jobs to 2.8 of the entire united states population
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.420]   To assemble them as fast as we need to ship them out
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:41.940]   So we're talking about a type of human that does not exist in numbers that we not we cannot possibly employ
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:47.700]   So we if anything we need to increase our level of automation so that we can continue to pay
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.060]   So many taxes to the united states of america and that could be
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:56.420]   Part of the discussion saying is there any way we can get you to pay more taxes in the united states
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:01.940]   If that even if that means that we can make it easier for you to bring some of your money back
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.180]   uh from uh
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:09.780]   Back from ireland back from wherever they've got it right now and put it to better use inside the the united states economy
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:17.140]   It's a complicated thing and i'm not it's we have to we have to admit that as unpalatable for me
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.540]   It is to think about
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.980]   businessman
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   business people without
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:30.260]   Public service experience being in high office. It is a very useful thing given that most the the the effects of
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.220]   Huge amounts of money being moved from one place to another
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:37.460]   Not necessarily something that's best understood by a politician. It could be best
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:42.820]   It could be understood very well of course by someone with a long list of experience in international business
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.500]   So as i said, i'm very interested to see what what comes out of this and there
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:53.620]   I'm sure won't be enough time to cover all of the topics because there's other issues as well besides net neutrality just privacy and security
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:14:00.660]   Uh, if you wanted it trump was very critical of look at apple not helping the fbi in the san bernadino case
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.500]   And said we should boycott apple
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.780]   uh, be curious
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.660]   Uh, what what what is said there about us and remember tim cook i think made a very strong case
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:13.300]   About why you don't want backdoors and how it impairs security for all of us
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:21.140]   Right and i wonder if timels, you know get on that soapbox and say that or if i mean i just such a short meeting
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.180]   There's so much to talk about i can't imagine it's it's also
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.780]   It's also going to be interesting to hear who else was in the room sitting on his side of the table
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.740]   His style of management seems to be not necessarily basically here someone that i
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:38.500]   I i've i've i've often said in the past that i have seeing i nerds who like explained the law to me
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.020]   So when i have a legal
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:46.740]   When i'm looking at a legal story, I don't pretend that I understand this i'm going to find someone who knows that i can give me a thumbs
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:51.620]   Up or thumbs down this seems to be his management style where i know this person i trust this person
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:56.820]   I think this person has the right experience for this i'm i'm gonna let this person this man or this woman
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:01.140]   Ask all the questions listen to all the answers ask all the counter questions
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.780]   And then at the end of the day i will ask thumbs up or thumbs down in this issue where they tell me thumbs up
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.980]   I will basically trust them to have given me good advice
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:12.260]   So it'd be interesting to see who is going to be sitting on it on his right and on his left
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:15.940]   During this meeting because otherwise it could be you know
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:21.140]   I I hope he like i got the i got the i uploaded the night i can't get the handful
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:24.740]   I hope he long goes because he gave me a nightmare scenario where he's sitting there going
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:29.380]   Larry it feels like there's an animosity towards time of a good you feel it's animosity is it just me
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.420]   Do you have something you want to say to Tim Larry? I mean is there something like me?
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   Let's hope it's not that
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:37.060]   They should get Georgia down in there to mediate
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:40.420]   I would be fired
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   Be interested to see if he long goes
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.860]   I think he Elon is one of the people who along with Tim frankly who might stand up and say mr. President
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.740]   elect there's something you need to hear
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.820]   Because he is of course all all over renewables and
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:00.340]   That's pretty clear that uh, the trump administration is all over oil
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:05.380]   So uh, he might have some strong entity between friends who really cares, right?
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.780]   I have something to say i'll be very interested. I hope i'll be watching with interest as they come out
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:15.780]   I really hope that we can you know if they if they're they're all ashen faced and looking down then we'll know
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:23.780]   Or the or they or they could be like rapidly giving orders with a very stern look on their faces
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.100]   To three underlings that cannot type fast enough
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.140]   Okay, first of all yeah, right?
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.540]   We're going to activate the plant
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:37.060]   And then match you peach you well wouldn't it be interesting if if uh, if apple in fact announces, okay
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:44.260]   We're going to start making iPhones in the united states wouldn't that be interesting and then what even more interesting when they find out that it's mostly robots making it
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:48.820]   AC two for rent we're building a new headquarters in vancouver. Oh, yeah
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:52.260]   apple has hit 20 million
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:57.140]   Paid subscribers with its apple music that is a big big
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.420]   Number it's half now of spotify
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.380]   But you know, I mean that's that I think people who are skeptical about apple music now
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.780]   Are gonna have to say no apples a player in this space. That's for sure
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:16.180]   It's sort of self-sorting and you know jim dalabla had a great thing on this and where apple is leaning really heavily onto things like rat music
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.700]   And they're they're targeting people who they think would have a high level of affinity for the service
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:25.700]   But you know people who like maybe classical. It's not great for classical. Yeah. Yeah, or he like he likes heavy metal
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:29.140]   And it's not great for him, but it's one of those it's very similar to other arguments
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:34.340]   We've had about apple lately where they they clearly know who they believe is their mass audience
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:37.620]   And they're targeting them sometimes at the expense of people on the periphery
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:44.180]   But it's a business. You know, I don't think it's their responsibility to broaden people's musical horizons
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.060]   I mean, I'd be kind of nice, but uh
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.460]   From the six leo from the six yeah
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.420]   Yeah
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:55.060]   70 exclusives this year according to eddy q
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.420]   including drakes of u's album
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.740]   but
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:03.060]   Universal according to cnbc universal music group
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.980]   Has stepped back from offering exclusive deals to streaming services
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.940]   and of course connye
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.900]   Kind of wasn't too happy conny has got his own thing
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:18.100]   Uh too happy saying the battles between apple and other streaming players is ruining the music business
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.100]   And
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.300]   Kanye also said he's running for president 2020. So there's there's hope
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.300]   Q said that
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.460]   Exclusives will continue in the future. They work really well for everybody
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:35.860]   Concerned says eddy q they're great for the label. They work for the artist and they certainly work for apple
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:39.700]   20 million
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:45.380]   And and the real key I think for apple is to get and I think they've reached it now is to get enough critical mass that the record industry can't
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.340]   Ignore them that the record history has to play
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.180]   Yes, which is what was critical to itunes success. Yeah, yeah
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:57.140]   New i-2 we lose our mind parally right. Yeah, should we lose our minds over the macos update?
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:02.500]   Do we have do we have room for that on the schedule lose our minds angry people are so angry what happened?
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:06.340]   So a couple of things one is there's all there's the same features you find on ios
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.140]   Uh
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.540]   iOS 10.2 so there's new emoji and all that kind of stuff
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:13.780]   But apple has been listening to the complaints about the battery life, especially on the new macbook pros
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:20.260]   And they said they're sticking to their guns. They're saying that in their testing they're finding the 10 hours is indeed the battery life under their test conditions
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:27.300]   Which is typically, you know half brightness no discrete graphics being used just the embedded graphics no heavy apps like chrome being used
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.420]   But they removed the time remaining indicator
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:35.620]   Because they said that it was people were misunderstanding it or it wasn't doing a good job in communicating
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.780]   How can you misunderstand there's three hours left?
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.500]   Well, so I actually was I when I was with you I was asking about this because I would open mine
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:46.580]   It would say 14 hours left and then it would say four hours left and then it would say 12 hours left
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:52.500]   And they've been doing that for months so I started asking around and people and people started telling me yeah the api is is is drunk
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:57.780]   It just it it it loses track of how much time is left and I mentioned it to a few friends who looked at it
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:01.780]   They go oh what what is happening here because they you know people kind of forget about this stuff
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.180]   It's sort of legacy built into mac stuff
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:10.420]   And apparently it's it's not that fixable because the especially now the dynamics of low change so fast
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:16.340]   I mean there's two problems one is that it wasn't keeping up with how radically quickly people would change the workloads on their machines
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:21.540]   They'd go from having 30 chrome tabs open closed chrome and then suddenly free up all these resources
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:26.740]   And they'd go from two hours left to four hours left and it it wasn't providing a useful amount of information
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:32.500]   But also it was dramatically wrong just on many occasions and misreporting
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.540]   Actual battery life there is there's a lab in resource monitor now for energy
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:42.100]   Yes, and that's got to be I mean if you're trying to figure out what's going on
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:46.820]   There's a graph on here and everything that's got to be the the best place to go to
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:52.740]   Figure that now it's more like iOS where you you still have the battery shaming so you can see what's using excessive power
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.860]   And it's not that those apps are bad if you're doing it like if you're transcoding video the video app should absolutely be in there
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:00.260]   But if you're not doing anything in an app is there that's a problem
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.940]   But it's it's like iOS now where there's just a percentage indicator for the battery life
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:06.660]   So you can sort of read it when it goes from zero sorry from 100 down
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.260]   I mean you can see you can sort by energy impact. You can see a graph
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:13.700]   Uh, if you want to know more about your battery life, that's the place
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.460]   And of course
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.940]   They also do tell you who the big battery users the hogs are and so forth right there in the
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:22.260]   On the menu bar
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:26.020]   And you can get like iStat menu if you really want that stat, but I was I was asking some of the
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.340]   The developers too and they were saying they get reports back from the api saying you know
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:35.780]   12 hours of battery life left when they know it's not and they were considering just capping it or doing something to sort of
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:38.420]   Normalize it so it's
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:42.020]   It's not ideal, but I think you know the timing of them removing it has caused some
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:46.900]   Yeah, some raised eye. Well, I kind of they did that remember when they were problems with signal on uh,
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.300]   on the iphone
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:50.580]   for
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:54.660]   The attend you but at 10 attenuation they just changed the scale on the bars
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.460]   They're barring it wrong
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:05.860]   Microsoft did that uh to avoid or maybe no it was it was apple the system 11 crash remember in the old days
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:11.140]   They just eliminated it. It's not the crash didn't happen. It's just there's no more error message
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.500]   So there's a long standing tradition of uh of that
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.260]   um
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.580]   Is is what else didn't see her at 10 point?
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.820]   Whatever it is
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.380]   12 in itunes. I think there's functionality that makes the video
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.540]   I mean, there's a lot of bug fixes for people who had graphics issues on the 15 inch macbook pro
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:32.180]   Uh things for the touch bar. There's just a whole round in their usual security fixes
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.580]   You know, of course it comes out sounds like if you have the new macbook pro
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.940]   You sh even though you're gonna lose that one little bit of functionality be worth
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:41.940]   Doing this again. You can run a third-party utility if you really really want it
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:46.020]   Well, we'll step back in and I think it's very I think the most useful thing is to look at the resource monitor
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.980]   Yes, that's really will give you an idea
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.860]   Um, and if you see anything under use it like apps are using a lot of power you you click on that
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:55.860]   It'll pop you right into that in the battery
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:00.340]   Uh use edge meters. So one on mine macbook pro at least a 1.85 gigabyte
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.500]   download
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:08.100]   Um, and it is gonna give you a new itunes 1254 macOS 1012 2
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.980]   update 1012 2
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.860]   All right. I'm applying it as we speak
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.300]   I was waiting to hear from you Renee before I did it
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:23.380]   Yeah, I was running the last beta, and it's it's been pretty good right I talk about I get about eight hours though
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.380]   I mean like I think that
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:29.300]   You use safari a bit right I do use safari
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:35.140]   Slack is one of the biggest impacts on my battery life because slack is very similar to chrome and how it treats the resources
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:39.940]   And I also do some like I use photoshop and I use final cut final cut is better than premiere
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.940]   But it's still on rendering video
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:45.860]   Uh, but I think that and I've made this complain about the iphone too is that apple is coming
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:49.780]   Or at least that that group at apple is coming from this perspective of people who just
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:53.300]   Wireless usage to them was checking your email and looking at safari
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:57.620]   And now it's snapchat and pokemon go and facebook and it's the same thing on the browser
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:04.660]   The browser used to be going through the new like apples famously going through the new york times apple.com a couple website and now it's he's incredibly javascript
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.420]   heavy
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.660]   Websites that we're looking at and web apps and all these these apps that we're running are non trivial
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.540]   And I think we sort of have to come into modern times with battery usage and either significantly improve battery life
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:21.380]   Or significantly update the way that they give us these battery estimates to take into account the loads that we're putting on these machines
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:25.940]   I I also think that the reason it varies so much is apps very so much, you know
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   Uh, and how they use the battery and so that one person will have very different results from another go ahead any
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:34.500]   Yeah, but but I mean rene has a good point
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:41.300]   I really think that uh if it seems to me that if one of the things that if apple would invest more time into
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:46.580]   uh focusing on safari as a pandora's box of problems
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:52.180]   Um, then they could really have a lot of improvement on the mac experience all the way across the board
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:59.300]   Uh, it's because just every single site that tries to pay its contributors for the things they contribute
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:03.940]   They have to do that by adding more more and more javascript for this that and the other
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:09.300]   And the longer these things run the more resources that they take and the more they
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:15.460]   The the less time they give the cpu to go into more power friendly modes
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.740]   Uh, and not only that but it affects the stability it's it affects
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:25.860]   The security really just the web browser if if if steve jobs felt so strongly against
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:30.580]   Flash that he was willing to forbid it against the entire ios platform
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:32.340]   He might
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:38.020]   Today decide guess what you're never going to use a browser ever again because this is like the the problems of flash times 10
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:45.140]   Yeah, um really the difference oftentimes when I find myself that when when I find that I'm i'm not getting the battery life
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.260]   That I was
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   I'm trying to get or excuse me. I was hoping to get
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:55.620]   Quit the browser and then just and then this use like versus the the google app that will just do like i'll give
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:00.740]   I'll do a search or return like a web result and that'll be it or i'll be reading stuff in pocket and
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:04.980]   Send things to the pocket reader instead of reading it in the browser
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:12.740]   And that's how that's the difference between getting like eight to nine hours on my macbook and getting like 10 11 12 has
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:19.380]   Screen brightness is a problem of course, but really if they can just really give safari the ability to say
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:24.180]   Okay, you're just wasting the cpu. We're just going to shut you down for a little while now
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:29.620]   We were we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna if we're gonna do like like semesters to loan to that movie where we're gonna freeze
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:36.820]   You went to an acrylic hockey puck for 40 50 years, but believe me at the time where you need to tell your ad server that the user is now
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:42.500]   Interested in yellow socks. We will unfreeze you and we will let you do rat on a rat on our customer
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.900]   But then we'll put you back in the freezing hockey puck again
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:52.180]   Here's a here's a little app that is promising to be eating memory on my macbook pro
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.780]   Sometime soon. Oh, eric ulson has put lemmings
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:01.540]   On so cute finally a real use is it the game though or just kind of they're just doing yeah
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:04.660]   I think they're just they're just green savers. Yeah
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.980]   I think that this is the best use i've seen of the
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:12.740]   Straight back man
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:15.620]   There's pacman too, right? Yeah, all right
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:19.860]   Can you play it or is it just again just graphics?
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.140]   Well, I mean he can't go up and down so like it goes to the guys
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.860]   The ghosts are gonna get you
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:31.620]   This this is this is such a great example of if you just don't control
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:39.780]   Construct what a developer can do let them find out just let them do the most awesome and stupid thing possible
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:46.260]   That's how you make things awesome. This is not this is not going to affect my it's not going to enhance my productivity
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.340]   But for heaven's sake
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.820]   If i if i'm gonna if i'm gonna give up like 1.1.3 hours of my battery life
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.380]   I would happily do that if as i'm typing
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.340]   You know, there's there's just like some sort of like a side scrolling
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.980]   uh like a jet lee action
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:09.300]   Action movie happening in eight bit graphics as i go, you know, that's that's that's what i would love to have
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:14.900]   That's that's that's a good investment of developers time a good investment in four dollars and 99 cents of my money
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.500]   And a good use of that olet display on a brand new macbook
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.820]   as you mentioned rene that one of the fixes in 10 12 2 is
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.660]   the
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:28.900]   Some sort of gpu issue craig fedder ree and knowledge is this in an email
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:35.540]   Um suggesting the problem has been solved. Thanks for the note. We believe we've addressed all these graphics issues in the latest beta
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:39.700]   10 12 2 hope you enjoy your new macbook pro. It's a fantastic machine
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.700]   craig
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:46.820]   Uh, so that's that's his um signature on all his emails. It's a fantastic machine
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.820]   It is
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.860]   Um
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:55.220]   So these were graphic distortions, but what about switching is there any there's no manual way to switch
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:58.340]   To save battery, right? I can't force it to use
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:02.420]   I don't know if they're still are but there were uh when apple first started doing the embedded plus
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:08.180]   There were there were utilities that would let you pick either or uh because things like the original tweedy
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:11.620]   Lorne britter hard coded it so that would have silky smooth
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:16.900]   Um, um, scaling scrolling but it meant that the gpu was always active. Yeah, that's got to be a
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.540]   pretty good battery killer
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.900]   And mentioning the uh problem with automation
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:29.300]   Uh, we had mentioned this before but 60 000 employees were killed at not killed fired
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:32.820]   Not killed. No, they weren't killed. They were fired
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.980]   Uh from fox called could go either way called. It's a good one
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.180]   um
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:38.980]   and
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:40.100]   replaced by
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.540]   Robots, uh, and I think that that's you just can see more of that right?
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:46.260]   Um, the question is how much does it cost to
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.780]   Use a robot and how quickly do you you know get that money back by not having to have an employee?
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:55.060]   But as automation gets more ubiquitous
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:30:01.860]   I think that's gonna and the labor statistics bear this out. That's that's going to be the problem
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:06.900]   Yeah, and there's and there's no one to incite for the reasons that I that i've talked about earlier
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:10.260]   but but also that also things like uh, uh,
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:16.660]   The business businesses are being run on uh shorter and shorter leatimes
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:24.740]   And if you can get a factory of humans to build something just in time to fill in order that they just realized needed to be filled in the next five weeks
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:30.020]   Okay, I don't know if there are that many people who are actually looking for jobs that can that they can actually do that
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:33.300]   That's really a Santa's workshop sort of a sort of problem
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:42.900]   Uh, it's we're creating it's basically the oxygen the the the gravity in the atmosphere of the world is moving away from skilled labor and into
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.860]   automation and
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.340]   It's I don't know what the what the answer to that is
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:58.020]   I love I love rene your subtitle to your review of the uh of the apple book is designed by apple in california the book and epic tributes to steve jobs
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.660]   the ultimate in apple pretension
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.980]   Or both
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:05.380]   And i'm taking it is probably a little bit of each right
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.740]   It's beautiful. I mean, you know the way I look at it
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:15.460]   Johnny i've has won more black pencil awards than than most collective companies and if the man like it's like that west wing line where
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:20.340]   We don't ever strut but then bartlett says the man deserves a drink you can't deny him that
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:26.420]   Yeah, does anybody who deserves a book? It's Johnny's if he wants it fine. It really is we're a better world for having it than not having it
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:30.180]   It's johnny. Ives. Uh, what do they call that chapbook? It's his
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.220]   Is his his portfolio?
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:38.100]   Beautiful. It's something that mental like his relationship with steve jobs and that design team meant an awful lot to him
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.220]   And this sort of it takes all that and puts it in a present in a present
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:46.260]   Like wraps up in a package that you could put on as and he said a few weeks ago on any design school shelf or library
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.340]   and
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.540]   If you follow rene's instagram, you know, he's got them all
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.500]   Including the sanaklas pikachu
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:59.540]   Uh, there are a new second generation pokemon
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:03.220]   And if you click on the san tepikachu link at the top there leo yeah
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.860]   Uh, there's one that says
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:10.420]   Yeah, that one. Yeah, how to catch it. You scroll scroll down a little bit. Oh, there's
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:14.100]   He gets even me a little sucker if you scroll down a little bit more
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:16.660]   You'll see there's a santa raych you can evolve santa pikachu
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.860]   And he now will he keep the hat after the holiday?
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:26.340]   Uh to be determined but apparently yes because that's whole part of the collectibility of the game is having these limited edition things
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:32.260]   That you can look for yeah, you want to get people to uh to play now if you have a
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:36.820]   You don't know this either, but if you have a holiday pikachu
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:41.540]   And you don't evolve until after the holidays will it evolve into a holiday right you?
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:47.300]   As part apparently if like the hat is a binary state so if you are in mind one of those
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:52.580]   If you hatch a pikachu from an egg that you got before the event started will be a normal pikachu
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:57.380]   So apparently there's a bit that gets flipped to say that this is a pikachu with shepoh
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.860]   And then it stays that way
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.540]   What I don't know yet is
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.220]   They said festive hats and we're seeing sanaklas because we're in the western world
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:09.860]   But apparently there might be other hats like I don't know what the hat is in maybe china or an
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.980]   In-person I want pokemon launches in india's moral
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:18.020]   Uh, which is a big market for them. So we'll see yeah, that's right. That's huge isn't it
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:23.380]   Yeah, they're teaming up with starbucks and sprint in the us and some big retailer in india for the launches
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:30.260]   I still can't get off that. I mean the as as a person who spent the first 18 to 23 years of his life
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:35.220]   Having parogis and and cold sausage two weeks after christmas to celebrate little christmas
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:40.340]   For the russian orthodox people of my of my grand my grandparents and their parents and their parents
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:45.380]   I feel as though I can I should be able to have my pikachu or my my ragu
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:50.500]   Have a san tahat two weeks after christmas fellas in on this tradition of little christmas
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:56.500]   Uh, well my my my grandparents on my father's side of an octo
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:03.860]   Uh were russian orthodox. They were and so uh, we would all every year we would celebrate christmas christmas christmas christmas christmas christmas christmas
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:12.100]   Of the regular, you know western christmas on uh on the on the 25th russian orthodox christmas is a couple of weeks after
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.660]   uh, the on the calendar then
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:21.460]   That then the other christmas and so but we wouldn't be like presence and keep the bunting up and it would be we would have like
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:27.060]   Traditional food like again parogis that my mom would make based on my dad's mother's recipe
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:31.700]   And the the tradition would basically be simple
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:38.100]   Food like the kind that our forebearers would have so we're talking about like old preserve meats
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:45.300]   Well, like I get like cold sausage cold ham cold this that the other uh something with something with some mushroom dish that
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:53.060]   Uh for some reason my my dad was the only one who was allowed to make and he and I would make a special trip to special stores
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:56.100]   Because you could only get I don't know if they were psychosyllabic, but you know
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.540]   These special mushrooms that you can't really get in normal places
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:06.980]   And so even even to this day I keep a I don't make parogis a couple weeks after the summer 25th
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:13.780]   But for me the day that I take the christmas decorations down is soon after little christmas. Oh, that's kind of neat
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.180]   I would like two christmas's
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.540]   Yes
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:22.020]   Well, the other the other cool thing is that if you like fall behind on like gee I have this really idea
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:27.860]   Great idea for christmas card, but I didn't get my stuff together in time because oh, I'm giving this is for a little christmas course
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:30.820]   My my people celebrated a couple weeks later
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:34.420]   It's not because I didn't get things done in time. It was because
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:38.740]   I'm my my forebears my immigrant my immigrant forebears
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:43.380]   We'll all be stuff. We'll all be celebrating little christmas soon. It'll be great
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.340]   More than one day of christmas. It'll be so much fun
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.900]   Uh, we're gonna take a break come back with your
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:53.620]   picks of the week, but first a word from audible
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:56.820]   We love audible. We're all audible fans here
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:02.740]   Uh, audio books from audible are just the best way to spend time in the car in the gym
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.460]   Doing the dishes making the bed
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.700]   walking the dog
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:13.380]   audible.com is the place to go to browse hundreds of thousands of audio
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:20.740]   Oh, it's books mostly, but there's shows there's radio shows. There's performances. There's speeches
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:23.940]   There's all sorts of great stuff. I've become a big fan of the
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:26.580]   um of the books
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.180]   The biographies and I think audible knows i'm looking at my audible page
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:32.740]   and uh, here's a
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:39.300]   Uh, the classic biography that came out a few years ago of Leonard kon who passed away just a month ago. I'm your man
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.580]   I gotta be listening to that. I just got the uh
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:49.300]   Robbie robertson's book about the band and now I see there's a new one from elvis castello read by elvis
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:54.420]   Castello not Presley called unfaithful music and disappearing ink
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:37:00.180]   I uh, I just love audible. I always alternate fiction with nonfiction
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:08.900]   So great and by the way great science fiction. Oh, Neil game. It has a new one the graveyard book. Oh, it's another full cast production
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:17.940]   I love what was it? What was it the american gods? They did a full cast production? I did a whole right that wasn't wasn't even a bbc series or radio series
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:23.860]   It was just we wanted to do a kick-ass audio audible book. So audio books, Eric jacobe is in this wow

[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:34.660]   Doing those that that would be a good way to kind of find somebody whose voice you really like
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.700]   I think that's free if you're an audible member
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.500]   yep
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.500]   Andy and ico your pick of the week
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:47.300]   Uh, I had a software pick ready to go but it rather severely let me down yesterday
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:47.780]   So
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:52.980]   Right while I dig that while I dig to see if that was my fault or just bad software bad software
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:40:00.500]   I've got kind of a weirder pick for you. Um, you know, you we've often talked about like distraction free word processors
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:03.780]   These are slimmed down word processors. Let you focus just on the stuff that you're writing
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:10.660]   We've also talked about uh utilities that will like shut down your internet for us for a number of hours
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.980]   So that you either have to wait it out
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:17.060]   Uh or shut or restart your mac to get your internet back to also help you to focus
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:19.940]   Uh, and there's also you might have also seen this 500
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.740]   Uh computer called the
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:26.180]   It was as a kickstart was called the hemming right and then it was called the free right
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.500]   This 500 dollar e
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.580]   E ink display with like a big typewriter type keyboard and metal display
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:38.420]   Uh metal metal case. I've got something kind of better. I picked i've been looking at like alternative things to write on
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:43.300]   Uh for the past three or four months and so one of the most interesting things I came I came across
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.180]   Were these little computers by alpha smart?
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:51.860]   These were uh a big big business for the company this alpha smart company
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:55.620]   Uh, they were these are were made for use in schools
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:01.300]   Because where you can't really get a compute by a computer for every single person in the class
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:05.380]   Uh, and really all you want to do is teach them how to write and teach them how to like
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:08.180]   Write their reports and teach them how to type
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:13.860]   Uh, and so these things that were built like they're they're built like things they're going to hand out to little kids
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:18.340]   So they're built like tanks, even though they're pretty much just word processors
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.020]   They might have a couple of extra little apps on them
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.420]   Uh, but the great thing about them is that now they're not making them anymore and school systems
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.700]   I moved on to like chrome books and so every now and then
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:34.660]   Uh, the school system will dump like they're 200 practically great brand new looking alpha smart devices
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.980]   And you can pick them up for like 10 or 15 dollars. I paid I paid 10 dollars for this one
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:42.260]   And this one came in a case and with a charger and everything
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:46.820]   It's in beautiful brand new condition and this is like the last version they made
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:50.900]   Uh, the neo twos are really really good word processors
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:54.740]   This is the dana that actually runs like palmOS software
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:57.140]   And actually also has wifi
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:59.700]   And else has like little web apps and little email apps
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:03.060]   So it's basically like an old fashioned like a newton message pad
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:08.340]   But with a really really lovely to type on keyboard beautiful keyboard beautiful screen
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:13.220]   Uh, and the nice thing about both of these things is uh, if you're talking about like I was also
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:15.300]   uh thinking about
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.740]   uh devices like
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:19.220]   Which I thought to get this up beforehand, but here we go
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:24.740]   Like if you want to be nostalgic you can get something like the the t-r-a-sady model 100
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.980]   Oh, and of course, I'd love to get that
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:30.900]   And they're and they're apps are also quite lovely and also oh my god what a great keyboard
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:36.100]   But how are you going to get like the text out and into something useful doesn't have a modem on it
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.980]   It does have
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:41.220]   Yeah, well, it does have a modem like it with a dinjek
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:43.220]   But you have to get an acoustic coupler, I think
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:47.460]   And there and there and to be fair there are like a whole bunch of it's the internet
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:51.860]   It's the modern age and they're people who are t-r-a-sady model 100 portable computer enthusiasts
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:57.060]   Who can sell you like a at rs 232 little box that will let you put in
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:00.500]   Like an SD card and basically print to a text file
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:03.220]   But like that's a little bit too much for nostalgia
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:07.380]   The cool thing about these things are that again, they're designed to be as trouble free as possible
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:15.140]   So although there are some models that do have like SD card slots so that you can save it to an external device
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:19.060]   With all of them they also have a standard like usb port
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:24.180]   Uh on the back of it. So all you have to do is plug it into your mac
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.620]   Type a button a tap a button and it will actually
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:33.620]   Appear to the mac as a typewriter excuse me as as a keyboard and it will simply type out
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.020]   Everything that you had put into this text file
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:40.180]   So we'll just simply open up a word document or open up google docs
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:46.100]   Hook it up the cable press this button and everything that you wrote on this little device you paid 10 to 30 dollars for
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:49.300]   Will miraculously start being typed into this new document
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:55.140]   So if you if you really are looking for if you if you're curious about what you could do with a
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:44:02.180]   Really a true distraction free writing device that's optimized towards letting you beat it up
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.980]   Having a really good keyboard lasting just like a eternity on batteries
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:08.980]   then
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:14.260]   Goodness 10 bucks is not a whole lot of money to spend it's not a whole lot to risk even if you're spending 30 or 40 dollars
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:20.340]   Uh today. I was looking at prices and the cheapest ones are like 20 to 30 most of them are 30 to 40
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:26.980]   Uh, but it's a neat thing to have around and if you are determined to write a thousand words a day
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:32.020]   Uh, and you think that well what if I just have a specific device that I do nothing but write this novel on
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:36.980]   That's again. That's it's an interesting thing to try out and actually like it a lot if I myself writing
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.140]   Not regularly not every day or even every week on it, but there are times where i
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:47.940]   I need to I want to I want to spend today basically writing it something creatively that i'm not going to be able to sell anywhere
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.180]   But i'm not going to have funds. We're going to take this to starbucks with me and it will be
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:57.860]   Pretty damn cool. I like it the alpha smart either the dana or the neo 2
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:00.340]   Uh are great. I like it
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:03.380]   Renee richy your pick of the week
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:03.940]   All right
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:08.340]   So i made a fool of myself a few weeks ago when I picked the apple air pods presuming that they would actually
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:15.380]   Launch on time and so I want to sort of reclaim what was left of my dignity and make them an official pick now that they have actually
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.380]   Started shipping they're available for order
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:20.900]   Uh, they've been pushed out. I think for five weeks already online
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:26.020]   But you can you can take your chances at an apple retail store reseller or select carrier partners
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:32.340]   Next week. Uh, i've been using them going on three months now. I'm super super happy with them
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:37.220]   Um, they're one of the best sets of headphones i've ever used i i am not an audio file
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:41.700]   I really don't notice sound quality. So if you are you might want to stick with your golden ear cans
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:47.220]   I can't speak to that but they're crisp. They're clean people think i'm talking on my iphone when i'm talking on the air pods
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:52.180]   And to me, that's always a great indicator that it may not be wonderful sound, but it's it's clear sound
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:56.660]   Uh, they pair really easily apples integration is really slick
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:00.100]   Uh, you don't have to worry about codes or bluetooth or anything like that
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:02.500]   Once you pair them with your iphone
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:05.620]   If you have an apple watch that just gets synced along with all your other data
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:13.300]   If you have iCloud, it'll take the apple the uh, ear pod the air pod. Sorry and make them available on your ipad and your mac as well
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.580]   Uh apple tv you have to use them like regular bluetooth
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.820]   But that means that they actually work like regular bluetooth
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:24.260]   So you can pair them with an apple tv the way you would any head fed with set with a windows phone with an android phone
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.740]   with any of those things
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.380]   Uh
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:31.540]   In going wireless it really is freeing you don't notice the cord until you stop using it
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:36.820]   It's almost like a cliche and it just it doesn't pull on you. It doesn't pull out. You don't feel weird turning your head
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:41.780]   Uh when you when you're looking around and they are a little bit goofy if you turn them upside down
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:46.580]   They would look like antenna, uh, but that's at sort of the state of the technology for now
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.460]   And for me the trade-offs are more than worth it
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:50.340]   So
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.900]   They're about equivalent to apples ear pods and what you're paying for the difference is that w1 chip
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:57.060]   And their ability to not have a cord to send
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:02.500]   Uh data back and forth and to sync audio back and forth without the need of a hard wire connection
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.220]   And in that sense, they work perfectly. I've never heard them out of sync
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:09.540]   I've hope I've only had them drop twice. I think and that's when I took my phone and moved it
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:12.900]   Uh, you know, basically entirely around my body put it in my pocket
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:15.860]   I lost the sound for about half a second and then it came back
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:18.340]   And otherwise they've been super stable and solid
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:22.660]   So if you're looking for a stalking stuffer, or if you're looking for something to get someone in the new year
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:26.020]   Can't recommend the ear pods enough. Is there not waterproof are they?
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:30.980]   When I said that I just managed to disconnect them as I was so you don't hear what I'm saying
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:35.700]   I think if you put your head underwater, you're gonna lose both of them
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:42.100]   I don't well, I'm just wondering because you lost them in the snow. I'm wondering if uh, if that's hazardous
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:47.140]   Oh, can you hear me now, Renee? Yeah, apparently when I when I started opening them, they repaired with my phone. Yeah, so I have to
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:49.380]   Yeah, yeah, uh, are they waterproof?
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:54.100]   They are not officially waterproof. I have worn them to work out. I've worn them in the rain
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.860]   I've had them in the snow. I did some snow angels full-time fashion
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:00.740]   And they've been fine. I wouldn't suggest immersing them
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:04.820]   Or swimming with them, of course, but for normal where they've been they've been perfectly good
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:10.100]   This isn't specifically Macintosh related, but gosh, I love it
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:14.340]   And I thought I'd share this with everybody and thanks to my old friend Tim Poser
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:19.620]   Who's a radio station engineer and dane jasper who have sonic done that both of them posted this
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:24.180]   on facebook this is radio garden radio dot garden
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:31.940]   And I don't know. Did any of you as kids listen to shortwave radio or try to listen to distant stations?
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.020]   It's kind of like that. It's a globe
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:38.020]   You could turn my audio up now karsten. I know I made some noise a little bit earlier
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:40.500]   And as you move around
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:45.060]   You're you're you're kind of tuning the dial but doing the dial
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:51.060]   Using a map a google I guess it's google map of the world and where you see green dots
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:56.180]   That's where you can see radio stations click on the radio station and you can listen to it
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:49:01.220]   We're now listening to uh, Reno's best rock from sparks, Nevada
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:08.660]   And then I can tune some more and I don't know where is this up in the mountains there. This is yukaya kwan
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:11.540]   um, you can also choose
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:17.860]   Jingle's and you'll get some of the great classic six d's uh jingles from khj
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:22.900]   Plus radio you can get history. I'm not sure what this is maybe
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.980]   historic
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:30.740]   This is sound bridge between cologne germany and san francisco established by bill fontana probably related to the
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:33.380]   people who designed this
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:37.860]   site, but I just I see i'm the kind of person that likes to uh,
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:41.060]   Fragment the song that I taped off tune around
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:46.020]   And now you can tune around the whole darn world
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:50.340]   And listen to radio stations that are broadcasting streaming
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:52.980]   over the internet
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.660]   I love this. I don't know you could plant spent hours
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:01.380]   Listening to punjabi radio
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:04.500]   That's by the way, that's my old radio station
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.020]   That I used to work at klok in san ose
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:11.460]   But you know here we go. We're in kostorica
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:19.620]   Apparently they like american music in kostorica radio kind of hagagua
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:23.780]   Panama like love this it's a radio dot
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:26.020]   Garden
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:32.180]   And yeah, if you want to listen to bbc you can uh, you can do that. You just of course have to scroll on over to the uk
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:34.900]   and there's quite a bit of
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:36.900]   BBC action
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.100]   And wow
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.260]   I'm totally I'm totally done. Is this fun? I remember there used to be a
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:48.340]   A regular mac desktop map that wasn't really as nice as this. I think that I think roganita made it maybe
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:55.220]   Yeah, just the ability to just spin the spin the planet to here is the place that's been in the news recently
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:58.180]   I just want to I don't even want to listen to the news in this area
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:03.140]   I just want to listen to the music that people in this area are listening to while they're going through a problem
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:05.380]   And and you know, I mean
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.540]   Some of it's quite obscure
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:11.140]   And some of its big city stations all of it is obviously on the internet
[01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:16.580]   But nowadays I would say every broadcast radio station has an internet presence
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:19.700]   So pick a pick a part of the world. Do you want?
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:23.700]   Scroll on over to it and hear what they're saying
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:26.100]   in the
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.100]   the ukraine
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.980]   In ukraine ukraine no the
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:37.700]   I why why did we ever say the ukraine? I don't know I grew up the same way and but it's someone corrected me
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:44.420]   When not to me why that was not just wrong, but also insulting people it's offensive. It's like and it's like oh goodness
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:49.940]   It's so it's so easy to be ignorant and you're like, oh, yes, we've always said but yeah
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:56.020]   It was always taught. Oh and here is the ukraine. Yeah. Yeah, so ukraine not the ukraine
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:58.660]   Is you right? There's radio hobby from poland
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.740]   I just love it. Anyway, a lot of fun radio dot guard not particularly makintosh
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:09.780]   You could do it in any browser. It's just a browser app, but pretty pretty darn cool
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:13.940]   2016 does not suck completely not that's good
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:18.580]   If that makes you feeling you feel better about the year than I'm that I job here is done
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:25.060]   I just I just remember how difficult it was for me to try to tune in the pbs station in new hamster
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:26.580]   I did all this. Yes
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:32.900]   They got because they brought they had the rice of dr. Who and wgph and boston did not for some stupid reasons
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:35.780]   if I wanted to watch dr. Who I'd have to like
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:40.980]   get my get get the black and white tv that my sisters could have
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:44.740]   Pull it out take it to this one room where I could kind of get at it
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:49.060]   And if it was a clear night and just be able to spin the globe and oh so fun
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:55.380]   What I did a lot of that with radio. Yeah, that's probably where I got my love for radios listening and you feel and you feel like you are traveling
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:57.620]   You feel like you're moving from one place to another. It's amazing
