[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.160]   Andy Inaco is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.680]   We're doing bowling call.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.120]   Can I be like the announcer from Frostbite Falls?
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Can you do that voice?
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   I can if I just take myself from the microphone.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   I love that voice.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   Why is my sweet turn then?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   Yes.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.480]   Well, that's a brand new wristwatch.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   Yes.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   $10,000.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   Bonewinkle thinks he can raise the money for the spa tradition.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.400]   Well, no, Rocky.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.320]   It looks like these are made of gold.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.880]   Also with his Renee Richie.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.640]   There's no use case for a smartwatch yet.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.440]   Oh no.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.000]   Bullwinkle, what have you done?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.640]   I don't know what that is.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   Also here Renee Richie from iMour.com.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640]   I'm so sorry.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   Hi everyone.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   Hi, Rock.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   Oh, it's Natasha.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   Hello.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   It's who's in Squirtle.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   Salenideskleilweil from iMour.com.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   Hello.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   Musen Squirtle.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   I am bad at Russian accents.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   Yes.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   No, you're good.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   Oh, hey.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   Hey, how are you?
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   Oh, it's so special.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   Hello everybody.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   Hello.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640]   Hello, serenity.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   How's things?
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.640]   Things are good.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.880]   I had to do math in my head.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   It was only two weeks ago that you were here and Renee was here and you and you and you
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.320]   were here and we were talking about the Apple Watch.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   It's true.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Yep.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.560]   And one of the reasons that's germane is the Apple Watch goes on sale pre-order April
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.520]   10th, which is only about two weeks away, two or three weeks away.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   And then April 24th, we can actually put one strap one on, so to speak.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.960]   That was six weeks.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's a long time for Apple between announcement and availability.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Is that the longest ever?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.840]   Long as I can remember.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   In terms of...
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.360]   No, if we don't count like the iPad being announced and then a few months.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   Yeah, the iPhone.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.800]   Yeah, the iPhone was six months, right?
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.600]   And then they announced the launch date and then it was a few more weeks.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.120]   I think the president is more like the September and where they said, okay, well now obviously
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.600]   we have to be able to let these out in the world so people can actually use and test
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.560]   them and plus we have to file the design.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   We're not going to announce what is going to be available apart from a time frame.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.720]   So this is probably unprecedented in the sense that we're saying we've got a firm launch
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.120]   date, but it's going to...
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   You've got a couple of months to...
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.560]   We realize you probably are going to have to roll some pennies to get that $10,000.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.000]   So start heading to the down to the coin counter machine at the supermarket.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   Don't put the $10,000 in pennies in all at once.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.200]   Apple TV was a little bit similar because it was showing off the fall before as ITV and
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.600]   then during the original iPhone event they showed it off again as Apple TV, which was
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   several months later.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Interesting.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.080]   So they do these teases sometimes.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.120]   When products are hard, Leo.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   New products are tough.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   What should we talk about?
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.720]   Let's talk about the becoming Steve Jobs.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.360]   Have you all read it now?
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360]   I'm halfway through.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.280]   In the process, yeah.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.800]   I got my hardcover yesterday and I read about a quarter of it while I was donating like
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   blood platelets yesterday.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Oh, nice.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   Good day.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.200]   And then I was reading for so long I checked my email and said, "Oh, your Kindle edition
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.440]   that you bought pre-ordered a month ago has arrived.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.680]   Okay, so I can put down the book and go into Kindle.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.240]   So I'm about halfway through."
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   Yeah, that's how I've been reading it as well.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.480]   He's just taken next off the rails and bad things are happening.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.840]   So I've only read kind of the forward.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.520]   I haven't had a lot of time to read it.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.280]   I was reading it with my breakfast cereal this morning.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.440]   The guy who wrote it, what is Brent Schnettler?
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.720]   That's not his name.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.800]   BS is his initials.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   That's the only.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   Actually, two people wrote it, but Brent was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal when
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.920]   he first met Steve Jobs in 1986.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.120]   So he claims as a result of many interviews, a 25-year friendship, probably isn't the right
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.640]   word, acquaintance with Steve Jobs.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   Observance.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   Observance.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.520]   One of the important things to note is that he started his journalistic relationship with
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.000]   him well before the big clampdown on press really started with Steve.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   He had access that he would not know and would have been granted to him in later dates, like
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.560]   being able to hang out, being able to see parts of his daily routine that wouldn't be shown.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.840]   He came in when he was trying to get next off the ground and he writes about how Esquire
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.520]   followed him around for an entire week, pretty much 24/7, and it's a sign of how important
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.120]   it was to Steve that next get good publicity and be launched as an equal to Apple almost
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.120]   out of the gate that he gave so many members of the press this kind of access.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.040]   So it's very, very interesting and it's probably my favorite Steve Jobs book so far.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.520]   Interesting, because some have cast this as the anti-Walter Isaacson biography that
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.000]   this one was supported by Jobs' friends and is more truthful about Jobs.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Has that…
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.720]   They've had a lot of smart things said about the Isaacson book and I think some of the
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.920]   most apt was John Syracuse and John Gruber when they talked about it and said that Isaac
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.720]  son had all the access, but he didn't have the insight.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.560]   He didn't write the book that a lot of us who followed Apple really wanted to write.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   The things he focused on weren't the things we wanted to know about Steve Jobs, like all
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.160]   the next era things and how he designed products and how he worked on it.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.800]   And this book seems to focus on those things.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.640]   This seems like the Steve Jobs book for people who were fascinated by Steve Jobs as a technologist
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.440]   and as a product guy.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.800]   Early on I think that he makes a really good point which is that the…
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.400]   I'm sorry, I should say a point that I agreed with wholeheartedly which is the most interesting
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.360]   portion of his life to an outsider would be the period between next and his return to
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:03.040]   Apple because Steve Jobs who led next to the place where next wound up is clearly not the
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.360]   same Steve Jobs that took Apple from the ashes and returned it to primacy.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.320]   So what happened…
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.400]   There's so much about…
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.120]   I think the more you read about the man, the more you realize that people seemed…
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.840]   It seems as though a lot of writers seem to know here is what the guy was like as though
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.200]   he didn't change through 20 or 30 years of his life from the time he's founded Apple
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.920]   through the end of his life when actually every person is an evolving person and they're
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.440]   capable of doing things later in life.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   They're incapable of doing earlier that there are faults that they have identified
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.920]   and corrected as they go.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   And again, I'm only…
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   I'm barely halfway through it but I'm very, very pleased to see that the author seems
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.880]   to have an idea of what the progression is like and a broader perspective not only on
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.720]   Apple but of the entire industry.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.080]   He understands things I think in context.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.120]   I don't think the Isics and Book was bad.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.400]   I think it was necessary for what it was but I didn't…
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.680]   My one big complaint about it was that I thought it lacked that sort of broad perspective
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.800]   and this sort of informed nature of here is what the technology world is like.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.560]   Yeah, so we're kind of dichotomy there because I think that in general the book from What
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.200]   Little I've Read of It feels much more personal than the Isics and Book does but it does touch
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.080]   on sort of those grand subjects and those grand topics.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   So it's…
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:29.360]   It feels a lot more like you're being invited into Steve's hearth so to speak and hearing,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.280]   you know, basically like sitting around and shooting the dish as opposed to sitting and
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.120]   reading an academic book about the, you know, listening to a lecture about the life and
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.960]   times of Steve Jobs.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   Is it…
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.280]   You know, sometimes reporters will do that artificially.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.000]   Is it genuine that he is in fact sitting around with Steve Jobs?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Is that…
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Do you sense that as…
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.440]   Is it a trope of the book or is it actually true?
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.440]   I don't get the sense.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.640]   I think whether or not…
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.280]   I don't necessarily think it's entirely false but whether or not it's, you know, whether
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.880]   or not there, you know, stretches of the truth in terms of the way that they crafted the
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.280]   narrative, I think it just feels very…
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.720]   It feels very genuine.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.480]   There are not like 100% of the crafting was genuine.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   It feels genuine and it's a…
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   It's a…
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.520]   Again, I've only read the first chapter or two so I can't be…
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.080]   I can't comment on the entire book quite yet but I'm really…
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.240]   And it feels very natural to me.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   I should…
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.840]   Brent deserves his real name.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:37.280]   Brent Schlenner and Rick Tetzelli and in the preface they say, "Even though we both
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.440]   wrote this book and researched it over many years, we're going to use the first person
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.840]   pronoun 'I' throughout and when it is used it refers to Brent."
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.840]   Right?
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.520]   Yeah, it works really well and the thing I like best about this at least so far from
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.800]   the parts that I've read is that sometimes you feel like the author is going to push
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   a narrative like Steve Jobs was a jerk or Steve Jobs was the greatest thing since sliced
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.920]   bread and this really seems like it presents the anecdotes and it doesn't sugarcoat them.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.640]   You can choose to interpret them and they sort of give some rationale about why he might
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   not have been very nice in a situation or why he might have been generous in this situation
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.800]   but it feels more like I can sort of take from it what I want rather than a certain
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.560]   angle being shoved right at me.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.320]   Yeah, I like that sometimes it seems as though things that he's read and other biographies
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.440]   have sort of stuck in his car or the collective his.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.600]   There's a section that actually highlighted that some writers have tried to cast Steve's
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.560]   obsessiveness and his hunger for the spotlight and success as a Freudian attempt to bring
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.680]   down the birth parents who quote rejected him by letting him be adopted.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.760]   It always struck me however that at his child's worst Steve was really nothing more than a
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.960]   spoiled brat.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.200]   There are lots of stuff like that.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   Okay.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.920]   This is this mean stuff I'm talking about here's.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.920]   Right.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.640]   Here's the mediocrity.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   That's a good sign.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   It's not.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.960]   But it also it also takes a time to point out that you feel you hear like half of the
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.200]   story of how he yelled at these people and then walked out.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.360]   He has the other half of the story where someone chased him out there and found him like crying
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.240]   in his car and he decided I've screwed that up so badly.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.400]   Go, come on, Steve, come back to me.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.680]   No, I'll have to come back in to apologize abjectly but then I have to leave again because
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   oh my God, I screwed that up so badly.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.040]   So that's the sort of stuff that you're even earlier on the early on the book really makes
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.600]   you want to see what else these guys have to say.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.960]   So it sounds like all three of you recommended this is not approved by Apple.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.160]   No, but Tim Cook and several other the Apple executives and Lorraine Powell jobs were interviewed
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   for the book.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.520]   He said they declined at first but he persevered and he managed to get a lot of them on board
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   towards the end.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.920]   It's approved in the sense that he had cooperation but then so did Walter Isaacson.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.280]   In fact, Isaacson had the most important cooperation that of Steve Jobs himself.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.440]   Which is why it's an important book.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.160]   I mean, even if there are holes in it and I can't I'm not qualified to say what those
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.440]   holes really are.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.680]   The fact that here are the stories that Steve Jobs wanted to tell at the end of his life,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.720]   even that for all for its strengths, for its emissions, that is a significant and important
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.160]   part of the story.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.760]   And the anecdotes you refer to, I feel like at this point we've heard them all.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.560]   Is there new new stuff so far?
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.240]   I know none of you have read it all.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   Yes, there is.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240]   Okay.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.240]   Good.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   I can't wait.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.680]   There's something part of the part of what makes it so strong is that if there is a story
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.000]   you've heard a million times like how Steve might have screwed was out of some money for
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.600]   developing breakout, what is like a whole chapter in some other books is just a couple
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.040]   sentences here because I know you know it's he takes the details are important for the
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   narrative but assumes that okay, I think you've heard of this before.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   Right.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   All right.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   Can't wait to read it again.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   It just came.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:52.360]   The reason we're all Twitter is because it just came out this morning.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:58.120]   Officially, although I see some of you have received a copy earlier, the name of the book
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.800]   is becoming Steve Jobs.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   You know what I love right from the start.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.400]   That's not the photo of Steve Jobs.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.240]   Everybody knows they probably could have used you know more iconic photo but I think
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.560]   using this was really good because it almost says look, this is about the young Steve Jobs
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.680]   and Steve Jobs you might not have seen.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.400]   Actually, it kind of looks like the transition because you've got like the hippie flannel shirt
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.120]   but he's also got the iconic turtle neck underneath that as a eternal act as always bursting out
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.600]   of his chrysalis into the into the modern and to answer.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   Half old.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.160]   And to answer Reverb Mike's question in the chat room, no Steve doesn't wear deodorant
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.000]   in this book either.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Brent Schlender is the author and Rick Tetselli.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's published by Crown.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.960]   It is available now.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   Is it available in iBooks?
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   That would be telling or an Apple store it is.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.800]   How did it be nice in iBooks?
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   All right.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   There you go.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   I got my Kindle.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.320]   Even that it's a little highlight on it.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.320]   Good.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.400]   That tells you that even though it's not and I also love it that it's not a geography.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   It's not fulsomely, praiseful of jobs but it's it sounds like it's they said it was
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   a spoiled brat.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   That's you know, it's a good sign.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.760]   Well, I mean this is this is part of the story.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.000]   I think he underscores that you really can't reduce an entire man who lived for 60 years
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.720]   into just a just a cartoon character.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.680]   I mean, I've always thought that this must be something that's quite painful for people
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.880]   who were his actual friends and his family that there are people who have to tell like
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.400]   a reality story like a reality show where you get these people and then they're doing
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.800]   what they're doing but you have to cast one of them as the hero, one of them as the villain.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.280]   The other person is the wise person, the other person as the fool.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.600]   And so you can create this narrative where I want to cast Steve Jobs as this brilliant
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.200]   genius that yes, he had his faults but oh my God, he you know, he smoked the ground with
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.480]   his magic staff and up from there all the by himself rose the iPhone and there are people
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.080]   who have to simply say, oh yeah, he was just such a jerk and he was mean spirited and he
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   was full of himself.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.400]   And I think anything you want to say about any individual you could say is true to one
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.920]   extent or another but you really that's just like one point one pixel and a larger picture
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.240]   and you have to really see the whole picture.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.080]   I can't wait to read this actually.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   It looks really good.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   Also they'll audible.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   It is.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   Oh good.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   I don't have to read it.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   I can listen.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:15.960]   I will I will immediately I did buy the Kindle version of it but I will immediately get the
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.040]   audible version.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   Thank you.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.640]   And back of course there's lots to talk about Apple has really started the I think it's pretty
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   obvious the PR drum beat for the Apple watch even down to the point where if you ask Siri,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.200]   let me let me try this here.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   What are you doing?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.680]   Just doing a little traveling at the speed of light.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   It's fun.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.520]   Although time gets a bit sluggish in the outer galaxies.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.880]   Oh yeah, but what you doing?
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.160]   I'm learning some new tricks.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.040]   What are you doing?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.160]   I was just chatting with the Apple metallurgy team about the durability of ice nine.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   The metallurgy team.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.000]   What are you doing?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.240]   I'm helping round up jellyfish for the Apple watch.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   Ouch.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   Jellyfish.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.000]   Oh yeah, because it's a little animated time for you.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   What you doing?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.240]   I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of Apple watch.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.440]   There's a lot of Apple watch pros in there all of a sudden.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.000]   It's just the beginning of the PR drum beat.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.640]   We've got a video and lots more coming up in just a little bit.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.080]   Renee Richie and Serenity Caldwell from I'm War are here.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.520]   Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.080]   The times are show brought to you by those great my mattress.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   Why not?
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   Those great folks at Casper.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.960]   One thing that unites all of our advertisers is all of them.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.920]   They have found new ways to do business thanks to technology.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   Thanks to the internet.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:59.160]   Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses made in the US with high technology for a
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.400]   fraction of the cost.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.840]   They're really changing the mattress industry because by eliminating showrooms and resellers,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.840]   they save you money.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.680]   Now, you might say, "What good is that?
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.160]   I need to lie on this thing."
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.440]   Casper knows, and I think you probably know, and I know for sure because I did it, going
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.040]   to a showroom and lying on it for five minutes is not the best way to buy a mattress.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.240]   I end up buying a mattress that was really uncomfortable.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   We actually spent a lot of money on that mattress.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.920]   Thank goodness for Casper.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.920]   There's my Casper.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.160]   For those of you watching on video, it comes in a small box.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.480]   That's a queen size mattress in that box.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.680]   When you open it up, it comes out and goes, "Fff."
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.440]   Suddenly you have this beautiful comfy mattress.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.200]   Better than that, you have 100 days to try it.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.280]   100 days.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.760]   Shipping is free.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   They get it to you.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   They'll take it back.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.840]   It's completely risk free.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.960]   You need to sleep on this mattress for as long as three months.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.440]   If you decide you don't want it, they'll take it back.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   Absolutely.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   No questions.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   Ask.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   It is a great mattress.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.280]   I think you're going to like it so much.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.920]   You're going to change all your mattresses.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.960]   Casper mattress combines latex and memory foam.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   It's funny.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   I always thought the memory foam was on the top.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   No, the memory foam is the main part of the mattress.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.280]   The latex on top of it, if you go to the website, you can see how they make it.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.200]   It gives you a combination of firmness but give that is exactly right.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.280]   At least for me, you should try it.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   I'll tell you what.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.360]   These are great mattresses.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:32.120]   They started $500 for a twin, king size 950.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.840]   They're really easy to get upstairs.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   I like that.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   I ordered one for my son.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.560]   He's done the third floor.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.560]   He said, "I need a mattress.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   I need a ... I got to get furniture.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.960]   I need a mattress."
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.680]   I sent him a Casper queen and they got it up easily.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.200]   He loves it, by the way.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:54.480]   If you mention the offer code MAC break, you will save $50 as one of our audience members.

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.960]   The latex keeps you cool.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.600]   The memory foam gives you firmness.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   It's a really nice combination.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.480]   Just the right amount of bounce and give.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.320]   I need a little bit of firmness.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:18.680]   Casper.com/macbreak is a promo code MACbreak to find out more and to save $50 on your mattress
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   purchase.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.160]   A bed that loves you back.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.400]   Isn't that sweet?
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:33.360]   Inside Apple's top secret health and fitness lab, ABC had the video.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   They actually talked.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.960]   It's interesting with Jay Blonick, who is the guy who came over from Nike, the fitness
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:46.720]   guru who came over from Nike and gave them a tour of Apple's not so secret health lab.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   This is an ad.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.680]   I think this is an ad that doesn't look like Jay.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.080]   Remember the days when Apple would only choose either labs when they were in big, big trouble?
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.200]   It was interesting.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.000]   Does this mean ... No, no, no.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.520]   It's a different policy, but they realize that there's really very little to be gained
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   by maintaining such absolute airtight secrecy.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.080]   Sometimes if you really want to show off why all the work you put into a product and why
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.400]   it's such a good thing, why not show people how much work you put into it?
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.120]   People are interested in the story behind it.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.840]   This is ABC's Nightline.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.680]   Then notice they say, "Top secret."
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   [laughs]
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   [sings]
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.200]   Look, we're going inside.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.640]   Don't say it's top secret unless you're being shot at while you're filming.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.920]   It looks like the top secret Apple lab contains rowing machines, treadmills, and stairmasters.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.320]   And lots of people wearing gas masks.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.120]   Those are ... They're all bane.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   It's bane.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.120]   [sings]
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   But you'll see you understand Apple walks.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.160]   One of the things we asked at the event was because I have a rowing machine and I wanted
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.760]   to know if it would track that because a lot of fitness bands will, and they said, "Yes,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.520]   it will," and they did us spend a lot of time figuring out how to track.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.680]   I row every day, and that's one of the big frustrations of every fitness band I've ever
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   used.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.440]   It's ... All the previous ones are for walking and running, period.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.920]   It's not helpful if you want to do anything else.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   In fact, I've been known to put the fitness band, the jawbone up on my ankle while I
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.320]   bicycleed hoping that it would measure bicycling.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   That's good news.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   I hope it does do that.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   Yeah, it does.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   It's one of the settings.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.760]   It has different modes, and you could put it in the mode for rowing machines or for one
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.240]   of the other bits of gym equipment.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.440]   That is fabulous.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.200]   The reason I think that they had masks on is they're measuring oxygen consumption.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.640]   It's interesting that they're doing that.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.480]   I'm not sure what that has to do with the Apple watch.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.240]   Probably because remember it's calculating how much you're exerting and how much you're
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   moving around.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.600]   That's the V02 Max that they want to measure.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.440]   I bet they're just trying to figure out how to dial in one of those rings to say, "Here's
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.240]   how much work you're doing today."
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.080]   They have actual data that can compare to their guesses and just to see it.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   It doesn't count up with a good guess.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.960]   I'll tell you, if Apple's figured out how to do that, that's huge.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.760]   That's one of the things that no one else has yet figured.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.960]   The op-3, I'm told, my doctor, Mom, who's a customer will do that, but she says it's
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   not out yet.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.080]   I'm going to measure the rolling and other stuff.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.440]   This is ABC really ... Hey, look, they got a great interview.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   It's a great story.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.720]   People are interested, but this is massive PR for the Apple watch.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   Very much so.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.520]   I think it's really interesting that Jeff Williams be so out in front, especially because
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.720]   we haven't seen a lot of public appearances from him, aside from the Apple watch most recently,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.040]   the event where he got to introduce research kit.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.640]   But actually being able for him to go out to ABC News and be the spokesperson for the
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.080]   health initiatives that Apple is doing, that's huge.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.680]   It's a big step forward into the spotlight for him.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.520]   Jay is Apple's chief operating officer, but this is Jay Blonick.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   Jeff Williams is the chief operating officer.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.840]   Jay Blonick is in charge of fitness.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.480]   Is Jeff going to show up on this later?
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   He was the beginning.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   He was the guy at the very beginning.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   He was the guy at the beginning.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.800]   Yeah, Jeff Williams is the COO.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:09.320]   There's the ABC correspondent actually running on a treadmill so that you believe that she
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.160]   was there.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.200]   And then more PR video from Apple.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.400]   There's a lot of it salted in here.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.120]   I think Jeff's official title is Senior Vice President of Operations.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.320]   I don't think he's ... Okay, not COO, but he's ... He's ... He took Tim Cook's job.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   Yes.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.320]   When Tim was a pastor.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   Essentially, yeah.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.400]   And he's in charge of all the health stuff that Apple, I believe, which shows you just
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.800]   how important those key sort of Voltron executives are at Apple.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.600]   He's the operations guy, but he's also got all this underneath them.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600]   Voltron executives?
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.600]   Well, that's the joke.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.240]   They all kind of combined together to make Apple from that page.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:50.680]   Oh, somebody reminds me that this company, ABC, is owned by Disney.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   Disney.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.280]   Which has very close ties to Apple.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.560]   I like yours on the board.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.120]   I shared board members and, of course, the Jobs family is the largest shareholder of the
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.680]   Disney company.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   That explains the access.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.840]   Again, it's just because I spent the past day just reading about early Apple and Steve
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   Jobs.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.740]   He opens up the book by talking about the first time he was sent by the Wall Street Journal
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.840]   to interview Steve.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.080]   Basically the first 15 minutes Steve was interviewing him as if to say, "Let's first
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.160]   see if you're qualified to talk to me about technology."
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.280]   I don't think that this ABC reporter had to go through anything like that.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.680]   She's useful.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.400]   She looks, I don't know where she is, and she certainly looks capable, but whether she
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.920]   is capable or not, she would have gotten this interview.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.360]   Well, this is, like I said, it's PR.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.160]   Is the PR starting to get a little bit oppressive?
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.520]   Because I got to say that I'm starting to tune out a little bit.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.560]   When Siri starts saying things like, "I'm waiting for the Apple Watch," now, admittedly,
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.480]   that doesn't get intrigued into, if you say, "Hey Siri, what time is it?"
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.800]   You have to ask, what do you want?
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.880]   Only you had an Apple Watch.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   You could ask the Watch.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.760]   Now, if she starts saying that, I'm going to get pissed off.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   But this is a big push for Apple.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.400]   You know what, Andy, to your point that Apple didn't used to do this until they were in
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   trouble?
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   I don't know.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:20.320]   I think you almost could say Apple's a little nervous about the watch and on about its success.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.400]   And maybe is pushing a little hard right now.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.040]   I don't know if they're nervous.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:30.120]   I do think that this is a device that they have extreme faith in.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   This is an Apple TV where they think, "This is the time to release the hardware we don't
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.240]   know what it's going to do, but we know we're in this for the long haul."
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.680]   They feel as though if we strike right now and strike hard, we will have one of the greatest
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.600]   product launches in Apple history.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.080]   And I think that's why they're really using every asset they can possibly use.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.680]   I think they also understand that this is not a device that anybody wants.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.640]   And that's not meant as a criticism of the device.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.680]   It means that nobody has almost nobody owns a smartwatch at this point.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.200]   And so nobody can say, "Oh my God, I've been waiting for a device just like this."
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.520]   Not only has nobody been waiting for it, nobody knows what this device is or why you
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.880]   would even want it to the first place.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.640]   So that's why there's so much education that has to happen in that time.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.120]   Maybe one of the reasons why they decided to do this announcement the way they did, where
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.160]   they're giving people six weeks before they can start ordering, is to fill that six weeks
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.320]   time with education, education, education.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.400]   And to say, "We know what?
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.920]   Maybe we're not going to be interested."
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.040]   Maybe you wouldn't have been interested in this after seeing a few commercials, but after
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.640]   seeing six weeks worth of coverage in every media outlet we can possibly get at, including
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.280]   high-end, $8,000 in issue fashion magazines, okay, I'm lying, but you know what I mean?
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.200]   This is going to get people off the fence from maybe this is sort of interesting too.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.920]   I definitely want to at least take a look at this.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.120]   Oh wow, I can actually go to my local Apple store and try one on.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   That's great.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.280]   It's a big challenge too because it was such a...
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.400]   They were going to get thousands of those things onto employees' arms out in Cupertino
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   and they were going to get seen.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.440]   So there was a big gap between September and now and it's really challenging to maintain
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.920]   initiative and momentum in PR for that long.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.040]   And you don't want to do too little and people forget about it.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.240]   You don't want to do too much and they feel oppressed by it.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.600]   But you want to do enough that it sort of builds and gains that momentum.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.720]   And to Andy's point, there was this great article in a blog to watch by Ariel Adams where he
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.360]   laid out the problem that Apple and things like the iPhone taught people they didn't
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   need watches anymore.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   Now they have to teach people why they might want them again.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.720]   From a watch person's perspective it was really interesting because he thought the way
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.040]   that Apple was tackling the bands for instance was stuff that even watchmakers weren't doing
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.280]   and the way that they were manufacturing these things, it wasn't like...
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.880]   He thought a lot of the current smart watches were like little plastic-y toys and this was
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.920]   really a watch aficionados kind of watch.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.200]   It was just interesting to see again from the watch perspective how they're marketing this.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.000]   Yeah, I also think it's...
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Go ahead.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.480]   I was going to say, I also really think that this is the first real brand new product,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.360]   not just an iteration, but brand new product that Apple's had to release since Steve Jobs'
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   death.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.760]   And while I don't necessarily think that anybody's nervous about that, it is a pretty
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.680]   big thing to have to do.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   It's a brand new product, a great deal of which is clearly directly inspired from Tim
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.880]   Cook and his leadership team.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.000]   And as a result, I feel like they want to make sure that it launches on the best foot
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   forward.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.040]   I think everything that Andy and Renee said as well is absolutely true, but the double
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.800]   combination I think is very important.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.840]   Is that me dinging?
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   Did you notice?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   Oh no, that was all me.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.400]   I had my sound on earlier.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.120]   I was waiting for an Instacart delivery.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.840]   It was such a clear thing.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.320]   You want to go get your Instacart?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.400]   Oh no, I got it.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.640]   I got it right before it's still.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   Is that you shopping?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   Is that groceries?
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.120]   Yeah, I hadn't actually tried it until today, but I'm recovering from a cold and was running
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.880]   around and I'm like, I don't have time to get groceries.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.400]   Wow, they deliver in an hour.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.960]   Does that work?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.080]   And they like subbed in some cheddar because they didn't have the right kind at the store
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.040]   and that actually worked fine.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.040]   So it was cool.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.240]   It was very fast, very, very efficient and not having to worry about getting in my car
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.280]   while I'm sniffly and unhappy.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.520]   What is it?
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.520]   A particular store?
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.160]   Is it a variety of stores?
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.560]   In Boston, they offer support from I think full foods and shaws and star market.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   So it's just, I think it depends on where you're living.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   I know they don't.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.360]   A&P in the northeast.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.160]   A&P owns super fresh.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:42.400]   Huh, I had not heard of this because we don't have it in beautiful downtown Petaluma, of
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   course.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   Instacart.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:50.520]   The one nice thing about living in a city is you get to try out all of the crazy startups.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.920]   Not so much in Boston is in San Francisco, but yeah, I had a.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   This is interesting.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.000]   They have surge pricing on delivery.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.960]   You want that cheddar?
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   It's 1.8.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.160]   It's going to cost you.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.640]   Wow.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.160]   So when they're busy, when more product customers want to delivery, they're going to it's going
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.480]   to cost you more neighborhood auction.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.000]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.480]   Who will deliver it fastest?
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   We'll get that cheddar.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.160]   So you get yet another advantage of being single and living and working out of your home
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   offers.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.240]   You can order things at 320 in the afternoon when nobody wants anything delivered ever.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.280]   And of course, whenever you have something become digital digitized, technologized, you
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.960]   get big data and here's some big data.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:41.280]   The top foods searched in 2014 on Instacart cold brew coffee followed by criminally mushrooms,
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.480]   art is in marshmallows.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.600]   Oh, dear.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   And Brussels sprouts.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.280]   Art is in marshmallows.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.960]   Art is in marshmallows.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.080]   Now drop a momentum.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.200]   Sir, Rachis sauce kale, quinoa, what is it?
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.000]   Kinwa, Kinwa, you know what?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Go in.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.680]   Kinwa, Kinwa, bacon, bacon was big.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   What happened?
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.760]   Greek yogurt and coconut water.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.880]   Those were the big foods of last year.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   They're dropping.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.240]   It's apparently no one likes kale anymore.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   Isn't this it?
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   I love big data.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.320]   I love this kind of stuff.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.820]   Interesting.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.180]   They have 50 grocery retailers and 15 cities.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.380]   I want some advanced analytics.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.180]   So I want to know who is doing the combined searches.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.180]   Like, let's get some market basket analysis going here.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.020]   Well, I think it would actually be more fun if I have access to those analytics.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.580]   I would like to see like, what am I buying?
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.140]   How often am I buying?
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.340]   And after a year or two, why is there a seasonal drop in my healthy eating?
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.420]   Is there a time where I start to decide that I want to start having more vegetables?
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.700]   Andy Inatko has been eating too much prosciutto and drinking too much rosé.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.900]   He's not suggesting too much for you.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.540]   Fortunately, his consumption of Himalayan pink salt has dropped along with an increase
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.660]   in artisan marshmallow consumption.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.060]   Yeah, they're really looking at for the Apple Watch.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.300]   We have like three bands for your nutrition where like, you know, vitamins and minerals
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.500]   and then pretension.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   Fred.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.740]   You're buying an expensive vinegar, but you could be buying a more expensive vinegar.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.940]   I don't know why they say this.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.620]   The most hipster cities.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.100]   Although everybody loves being associated with that.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.300]   That's how you sell more.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.820]   Yeah, I think the list is correct.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:29.780]   It starts at Austin, then Boulder, Colorado, Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, really hipster,
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.780]   I guess so.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.780]   I guess there's pockets.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:32.780]   Parts of LA.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   San Fran Philly.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.780]   Silver Lake.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.780]   Awesome.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.100]   Serenity, we are we still live in the most nerdly city ever.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.100]   You're not hip.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.700]   You're on the opposite of hip.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.700]   Total win.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.700]   Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.180]   Apple retail stores planning for the watch.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.580]   Mark Gurman has the story.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.820]   They're going to give you 15 minute appointments.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.660]   Now that's starting April 10th.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.660]   So does that mean I go?
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.940]   I guess I would go online and they'd say, what would you like?
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.460]   And as I would like to see the watch and they'll say good, you're 15 minutes of fame.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.460]   Is it two o'clock?
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.340]   Yeah, you can walk into, but you'll have to wait.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:20.180]   Ten or more try on stations per store and there will be a special experience if you register
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.180]   for the edition.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.100]   There's a champagne room in most couples.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   A champagne room.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.100]   And you got a patty.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.100]   You got a man who paid while you're trying to.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.780]   They've removed the bathroom from the back of house and they've changed into like a two
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.780]   slated special room.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.780]   I think it's a big mystery.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.780]   No, you know, I was actually good.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.420]   I was going to make a snide remark that that snide remark being that I think the addition
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.820]   that's those those people for which they will actually sanitize the band before they put
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.820]   it on me.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.820]   Actually be saying that.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.100]   Oh, well, no, it's interesting.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:57.940]   I was talking to Neil Seibert about this last week to we right before Mark put out his
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.100]   piece and we were hypothesizing about like how how Apple might go about doing this is
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:06.140]   and this is almost exactly how we were how our theories were we're playing out.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.340]   I'm like, it's probably going to work like a normal personal like Apple has had personal
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:17.180]   shopping appointments available for before I was working there.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:21.540]   And after I left where I was like 15 minutes slots where you could go in and get a computer.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.740]   But now I mean, you it makes perfect sense.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.060]   You tie it to the watch.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.660]   You have a specific appointment time.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.460]   You come in, you meet your one to, you know, your, your personal specialist.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.900]   Apple likes specialist for today.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.700]   They're going to guide you through the process.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.540]   They're going to show you your bands and also keep a careful eye.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.300]   I like an artist in marshmallow.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   It's going to be horrible.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.580]   Can I have the gold link bracelet, but this on the side?
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.900]   I get this one with that.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   Can I get this on the side?
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.100]   I'm thinking 15 minutes is so frustrating.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.180]   Not enough.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.940]   The lighting here in this store is terrible.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:52.940]   Can I see it?
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.700]   What looks like in the hallway outside the store?
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.220]   The parking lot.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.240]   Most stores will provide will be provided one table with at least 10 surrounding Apple
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.900]   Watch try on stations.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.820]   Well, some Apple stores will have more tables to meet demands, obviously, in those hipster
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   cities.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.180]   Apple stores will begin setting up the Apple Watch tables on April 9th and 10th during
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.020]   special overnight sessions for employees.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.020]   I'm sure the employees look forward to those every year.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.060]   They'll also begin a few hours of more extensive Apple Watch training in the couple of following
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.100]   couple of days.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.700]   He wrote this on the 18th, so presumably they're doing it right now.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:34.140]   And we do know that people were here for training around the spring forward event because we
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.860]   had quite a few Apple retail employees stopping by the studio.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.460]   They had a bunch of cities people went to for training in Canada, the US and other places.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.300]   We're close enough to Cupertino that it was easy for them to come up.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.460]   They say Cupertino, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta in the US.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:54.660]   Apple will split its retail staff into four zones when those hands on trials and sales
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   begin.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:01.540]   Zone one, stationed at the Apple Watch try-on area to assist customers in trying on the
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.140]   aluminum sport watch or the stainless steel.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.260]   Well, Apple Watch, if you can't afford better.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.620]   Zone two for sales will include two lines.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.740]   I'll get ready for this.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.620]   One for people who know exactly what Apple Watch they want to purchase.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:24.700]   The others, for those who are still undecided about the right watch casing and band choice.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.580]   Group three of employees will answer general questions about the watch's functionality
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.940]   and explain features.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:39.780]   And then group four dedicated to assisting buyers of the gold Apple Watch edition models.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.780]   And select it out.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.780]   That's only.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   Yeah, it's not every store.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.620]   So don't just be going right down to the Vallejo store because they ain't gonna have it.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.660]   This group of employees will be made up of experts.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.620]   Apple store employees who have worked at the company for an extensive period of time and
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.620]   have completed extra customer service training.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.620]   They're grooming.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.460]   They're grooming will be impeccable.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   A pair of experts.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.460]   Go ahead.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.460]   I was actually thinking about that.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:09.380]   One of the things I really like and respect about the Apple store is that I will see Apple
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.540]   store employees of every description imaginable.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.180]   I really enjoy the fact that I enjoy the fact that there are Apple people working at the
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.020]   Apple store who have like full sleeve tattoos that wear short sleeves.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.020]   They don't have to hide anything.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.020]   They don't have to take out.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.540]   They don't feel like they have to take out their piercings and they feel as though wherever
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.700]   that whatever they want to be, they're going to be accepted as employees there.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:35.420]   I wonder if there's going to be a different sort of rule for the people who.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.620]   Attend to the Apple edition people.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.700]   Ah gosh, that's a tough thing for Apple to do because you're right.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.380]   They've been so accepting.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:50.100]   In the past, I just ducked out.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:56.140]   You've got to think roller derby girls will not be allowed to demonstrate.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.140]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:02.860]   Yeah, we're both you and it's probably us if both you and Danny, you're having trouble.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.860]   Or it's Boston.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   I can't see.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.260]   Yeah, I can't see you guys all of a sudden.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.260]   I can hear you.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.260]   I can't see you.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.660]   Okay, we'll fix this in a moment.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   Oh, there we go.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.660]   Ah ha.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.660]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.020]   I can hear you.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.980]   I guess Jason likes serenity more than he likes me.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.420]   He fixed her first time it.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.380]   The I'm more Apple Watch sport edition customer service.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:31.380]   I think we know who's sport here and who's getting a proper line.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.020]   Andy, so he had $34,000 of Apple Gold on her list a couple of weeks.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.700]   The stores have if you've been in an Apple store, the stores have already started putting
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.380]   up lovely bio luminescent displays.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.660]   These are those these are those glowing Dura trans screens that is interesting that they
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.100]   went from displays like that to the very photography oriented people holding technology
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.100]   using it in real life.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.340]   And now they've gone back to the product shots again.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.140]   Well, the product shots look like that.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.700]   Yeah, they're pretty gorgeous, aren't they?
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.900]   I just said they are gifts.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.900]   I just want that animated and yeah, moving back.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   That would be amazing.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.980]   Oh, I love that video.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.220]   And I just want to see Mickey tapping his toes.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   Come on.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.220]   I want to buy the watch.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.220]   Come on.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:25.340]   Let's see.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.340]   Apple is also considered utilizing the same new text message based I'm reading again from
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.580]   Mark Gurman from the good book.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.660]   Apple has once again considered utilizing the text message based deployment system.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.660]   It's genius bar.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.940]   It uses to organize Apple Watch tryouts.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.540]   That's really I think what I'm interested in.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.660]   I'm sure people at home who are interested in buying the watch, which is a problem undoubtedly
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.780]   a small percentage of the total.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.540]   How is that preorder going to happen?
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.460]   I'm not going to.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.460]   Can I?
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.300]   Well, for instance, I can order online, right?
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   Yep.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.300]   In theory.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   Go to store.apple.com.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.300]   Say I know what I want.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.820]   I want the stainless steel with Milanese loop and boom.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   They did.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   They did.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.820]   It's worth it.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.820]   Arrives.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.820]   Well, I have to wonder if you're going to be able to do that for.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.820]   Yeah, the addition.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:20.180]   No, well, on the site, like the addition is there with a price button and everything.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.180]   I'm sure you can.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.660]   If you look, if your credit card is good for it, you can do it.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.020]   They'll take your money.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.020]   Why not?
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.100]   There's so much that's interesting about how this experience is going to be different.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:35.220]   Not just who's going to be serving these people, but also will they give people that
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.220]   same occasional.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.260]   Oh, you heard a pick up your order?
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.580]   I mean, let me scan your barcode with my phone.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:41.580]   Okay.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.620]   So we'll be out with your purchase in about 30 seconds.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   Here you go.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.620]   Goodbye.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.620]   Like, but I just spent $18,000.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.420]   Thank you for the $18,000.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   Goodbye.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   I'm also good shares.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.980]   I'm not even joking here.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.540]   Will they be sit down?
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.700]   Here's a beverage.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.700]   Here's a special area.
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.540]   I know it's very crowded in the store, but here's a quiet calm area where you can check
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.660]   it out and we can show you how it works.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.580]   I think they have to because anybody who's spending that much money on a watch expects
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.460]   that right?
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.740]   They should really just buy a blue bottle of coffee put one next to every genius bar
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.340]   and then let you try on editions right at the coffee bar.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.500]   I mean, that would just be the confluence of everything that's good.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:18.180]   I think if you go into an Apple store to buy an edition, whether it's the $10,000 or more
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.980]   likely more, often I would suspect $17,000.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.700]   And maybe you buy a few bands over $20,000 that they will not treat you as if you're,
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.700]   well, maybe they will.
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.820]   I mean, you can easily spend $20,000 on Mac Bros.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.660]   It'll treat you like they're Alex Lindsay.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.660]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.660]   Oh, hi, Alex.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.100]   Well, also we're not supposed to go.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.900]   We're also presuming that the people who are buying these watches are all like Thurston
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.900]   Howell and Lovey Howell.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   I know people who show up.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.220]   I know people who are looking for these watches are really just they happen to have
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.380]   the money for that kind of stuff.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.980]   But otherwise they drive not crazy cars.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.980]   They dress in not crazy clothes and they're okay with simply hi about the watch, please
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.620]   like serve that they don't they don't request or require that their feet be licked.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.580]   They just want to be handed the watch that they paid for and be shown not make sure they
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.020]   know how it fits and how it works.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:11.340]   The one billionaire that I know well enough to say I'm a friend of and spend some time
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.640]   with is you would not know from a distance that he's a billionaire.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.620]   He doesn't usually wear socks.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.100]   He'll pull up in a nice car.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.680]   It'll be a Mercedes or one of the high end car.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.740]   But you would walk in the door and you wouldn't say, oh, there's Thurston Howell.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.820]   This is just a normal looking guy.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.100]   He will almost he's a geek.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.960]   He will almost certainly want to get an Apple watch.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.980]   He could certainly afford to get a expensive one.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.860]   Now I don't know what kind of experience he would expect.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:45.260]   Remember when Oprah went to the Swiss store, the handbags and wanted to look at some expensive
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.980]   handbags and the saleswoman tried to steer to less expensive handbags and she was incensed
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.020]   and that was a big deal and was very right to be.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.020]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.900]   The pretty woman, you know, big mistake, big huge.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:07.120]   I don't, you know, in defense of the salesperson, it's a very expensive.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.600]   If you think it was because you was African American or if it's just expensive bag, most
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.120]   people aren't going to buy that bag.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.200]   Maybe you'd like to look at a less expensive bag.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.320]   But that's it's hard to not simply you have to start with a convince me that it wasn't
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.680]   a racist sort of thing.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.000]   And then even then then he's going out to, oh, so it's a classist sort of thing.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.580]   Even though like this person has clean hands, clean clothes, it costs you nothing to simply
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.540]   show someone this bag and then make it.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:41.460]   I'll give you an example which doesn't reflect well on me at all.
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.180]   We were in Las Vegas last week for Debbie's birthday, Lisa's sister and we were having
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180]   a great time.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.060]   Went to a nice restaurant, Michael Menace, a new restaurant in Bardot, it's called like
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:57.700]   Brigitte Bardot, it's a brasserie and I ordered a half bottle of wine and I misread the price.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:03.080]   And the price was 10 times more than I had read.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:09.480]   I thought it was and it was and I would have very much appreciated it.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.580]   If the waiter or some all, yeah, it said, you know, that's an $1,000 bottle of wine you
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.880]   just ordered.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:21.360]   In some way, I'm sure there's got to be some genteel way to do that, but they didn't.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.640]   And you know, I know why they didn't because in Vegas, a high roller, probably some jerky
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.720]   jerk would say, well, you mean I can afford that one.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.040]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.600]   And yell at him.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.080]   I would have been very grateful because of course we opened and drank the wine and at
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.800]   that point we owed them a thousand dollars.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.240]   There's a great book from I'm looking up the name of the author, but because I can't remember
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   it offhand.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:51.440]   A guy, Steve DuBlanc, DuBlanc, I'm sure I'm murdering that name has a great book called
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   Waiter Rand.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.680]   He used to be a waiter at a bistro in the New York City area and he wrote an entire book
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.160]   about the experiences of being a waiter.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:03.640]   And part of it is the ways to say, okay, I've served enough people who buy $1,000 bottle
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.880]   of wine bottles of wine to know this person cannot afford a $1,000 bottle of wine.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   But you're right.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:15.200]   It's the precision with which you can sort of indicate that there is a door towards buying
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.320]   a $10 bottle of wine and you're free to take it or not that that skilled people have.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.160]   Maybe this is part of the skills of why you need to be trained to sell $1,000 watches
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   opposed to three other watches.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   Don't you think that the Apple store that they have said things like people will come
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.000]   in to buy expensive watches that do not look like they can afford it.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.320]   Please do not say, oh, you should look at the sport model, but there must be some way
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.000]   to say, I don't know, I don't buy enough super expensive things to know, but I'm sure jewelry
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   stores do this, right?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.120]   Oh, you don't want that.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:58.200]   Lisa and I, when we were looking for wedding or engagement rings, went to a store and looked
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.120]   at a quarter of a million dollar ring and they didn't say, oh, this is a quarter of
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   a million dollars.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.520]   They did make sure we were in a locked room when they showed it to us.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520]   See that?
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.520]   I think that's the distinction.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.200]   It costs you nothing to show anybody anything they ask for.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.720]   And if you're afraid they're going to grab it and run, you probably have a bad security
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.600]   system in your store.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:19.040]   And that's usually the sign of a store that doesn't know what it's doing, that they simply
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.880]   assume that I'm going to walk someone towards a cheaper bag or walks or as often happens,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.360]   walk someone straight out of the store.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:31.560]   I'm amazed that I've in the past, in the past six months, I have walked into really expensive
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.960]   jewelry stores and sometimes without even calling ahead to explain like my mission and
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.760]   said, just show me an $800 stainless steel watch, show me a $10,000 watch, no matter
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.840]   what it is and show me a mid-range watch that's solid gold.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:50.320]   Granted, I'm not like in like flip flops and a Disney World, you know, sleeveless t-shirt
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.520]   or something like that.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.160]   But I'm dressed like the way that a nerd journalist would be dressed.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   And almost none of them had any problem with showing me whatever I asked them to.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.760]   Showing you's one thing you're right.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   Unless I got a photo.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   Unless I got a photo.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   Just start up to Google, Andy, they have no way of knowing.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   Nowadays they don't.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.800]   And I spent any, you go to an Apple store, you just can't judge.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:11.720]   And yet there must be some subtle way of saying, oh, you don't want that.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   You do know.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   Well, there is.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   Well, I mean, I actually think that Apple stores already do a great job at kind of
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:25.240]   finessing the customer's needs by asking, I mean, the traditional thing was always ask
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.880]   probing, probing but polite questions.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.720]   So instead of being like, what Apple watch do you want?
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.760]   You start off with being like, oh, so you're interested in the Apple watch.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   Well, not even right.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   Well, not even what's your price range.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.920]   But what do you plan to use your watch for?
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   Wow.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.800]   What activities are you interested in?
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.080]   Are you interested in wearing the watch as a day watch as an evening watch?
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   Are you interested?
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.200]   Do you like metal bands?
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.840]   Do you like plastic bands?
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.360]   Do you like leather bands?
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.760]   Like you probe around the question rather than it saying like, all right, what's your
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.760]   price budget?
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.920]   Sometimes it comes down to that.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.440]   Sometimes people come into a store and they're like, I have a specific budget.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   I cannot spend more than $1,500 and I need X, Y and Z in my computer.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.800]   And then the sales associate is like, all right, well, let's look at, you know, the
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.360]   computers that we have that fit your, fit your needs.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.320]   But other times people come in, they don't offer that kind of stuff.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.880]   And I feel like the Apple, Apple specialists are usually very well trained in terms of
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.920]   what questions to ask to sort of give away what the customer is looking for without ever
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:32.520]   having to be like, oh, you're dressed in a Disneyland t-shirt and box.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.320]   I didn't think we'd be allowing you in the store.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.960]   It's the problem with going from, you know, selling computer stuff to selling $17,000
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.800]   watches, I think.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.760]   I'm humbled by my preparation to write about Apple Watch stuff because when it comes to
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.160]   luxury items, I mean, I'm just clueless.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.000]   I don't know what these people expect.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.240]   And I think the mistakes that someone like me makes in writing about this stuff is making
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.680]   an assumption about what they want.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   Right.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   Okay.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.680]   We've, but we'll find out.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   Another question I have, April 10th is also when the Mac book goes on sale, but Mark Gurman
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:18.640]   says between 75 and percent and 90% of store retail saffal will be allocated to watch.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.520]   So is it going to be hard to buy anything else?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.280]   There's never been lineups for like new Macs or new iPods or those people.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.760]   They always have a little bit of staff on the side that handles that while they can
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.760]   do one for guy.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.960]   That'll be the guy with the tattoos and piercings who says, oh, you're buying a Mac over to see
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.960]   that guy.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.240]   But basically for launches, it's all hands on deck for the first, you know, hours, if not
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.400]   most of the day, and then it goes back to normal.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.440]   So they're, they're really good at staging that stuff out.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.040]   Should I get in line at midnight?
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   For the trial.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.040]   I'm going to vote.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.040]   I guess that.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   I'll try on.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.040]   The Mac, I would just, I would order it.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.280]   I mean, there's, I don't think there's any extra value in going to the store and yeah,
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.600]   because they don't have their, there's not a lot of BTO stuff.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   It's just right.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   It's like one for one.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   There's two choices.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   Right.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.880]   I wonder how they're going to handle traffic though.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.000]   Because they are going to have a lot of people coming in just to see the watch.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.400]   As not as though there was a lot of like breathable air inside an Apple store on weekends.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.560]   Anyway, two words, Andy velvet rope.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:22.960]   Are they going to have like, are they going to have like, thank you for 15 for coming in
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.560]   to see your 15 minute demo.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.680]   Here's a coupon for free cup of coffee at a kiosk that we've put outside the store.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.280]   Jared, Jared, Jared, New York City in our chair says exactly the right thing, which
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.200]   is high priced luxury items.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   It's not about the item.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.200]   It's about the experience.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:45.000]   So this is why Apple really has to create a kind of velvet rope white glove experience
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.720]   of some kind.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.080]   And you know, they're smart.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.560]   Why do you hire, why do you hire Angela Lawrence?
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   It's for this.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   It is an interesting question.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.960]   When I joined the Google Glass Explorers program, which is a fancy way of saying,
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   they do that.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.560]   $1,500 for beta hardware.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.120]   It really was a complete concierge experience.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.960]   It was here is a, we're inviting you to what looked like a, like a hair salon.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.120]   Someone is going to be taking care of you for an entire hour.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.720]   There are beverages, Coca Cola, sugar Coca Cola in glass bottles, whatever I wanted.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.400]   They spent an entire hour like fitting it and making sure that I knew how to use it and
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.680]   setting up with my phone and with my computers and stuff like that.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.640]   And that was a $1,500 thing with very little purpose.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.160]   I can't imagine what a $10,000 thing with very little purpose merits.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.760]   Yeah, like that, but with shrimp, shrimp dip.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   Yeah, shrimp.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.400]   It will be shrimp.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   All kinds of sauce.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:41.520]   If the sweet kind and the spicy guide, you buy that by the Milanese band, you get to
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.880]   have both kinds.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.400]   You know, I was very pleased because I like the Milanese band probably seduced by that
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:55.520]   ridiculous animated GIF, but I was very pleased to see it's not as a super expensive band
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.080]   as I thought it might be.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   I was surprised.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.800]   But that looks like the expensive fancy band, whereas the link band where they say every
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:08.160]   single link, we start off with a solid cue, a yard wide of aluminum and we hack away everything,
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.440]   but this one link and we throw out three out of every five that we make.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.400]   It's like, but that doesn't let my dad had a watch with a band like that.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.040]   I've never, the Milanese band is like that is super fancy schmancy as far as I'm concerned.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   Right.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.140]   I actually, Dr. Mom, who is apparently an expert in everything, including jewelry, she
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:30.140]   makes it tells me that that actually that kind of style, first of all, it's never been
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.540]   called Milanese.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.520]   But that kind of style is not expensive.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.020]   It's not an expensive style to get.
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.020]   But you're right.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.460]   The link band, when I looked at it, looks like something for the pocket protector brigade.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.380]   It's not ugly, but it's not like, wow, I could either have an extra, I could either have
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:53.620]   like a second hand pickup truck for moving things around and own it, or I could have this
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:54.620]   little band.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.620]   Well, again, though, if you go to, if you go to a blog to watch, you go to Hoda Key and
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.940]   you read the watch people talking about it.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.940]   Their eyes are just full.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.020]   They're like, why, you know, it's been 50 years and watch people couldn't do this.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.220]   How can Apple just walk in and engineer this stuff?
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:09.100]   So it's definitely got appeal to people who like those sorts of things.
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.100]   But that's hard to.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.300]   I'm, I've, all of us have been now more aware of expensive watches, anything else.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.620]   One of the things I like that I often do when I'm trying to evaluate something that
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.420]   cost eight X hundred dollars, like even the stainless steel one cost eight hundred dollars.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.380]   I put myself in the mind of, okay, I've got a hundred dollar budget to buy a really nice
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.460]   stainless steel watch.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   What's out there?
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.020]   And when I look at like what's available as $10,000 luxury watch, my eyes pop out at
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:39.620]   how gorgeous some of these watches are and how interesting they are.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:45.700]   Whereas it's not like the Apple watch is ugly by any means, but it doesn't look like if,
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:50.500]   again, if I have a $10,000 budget, I would much rather have a sport edition of this and
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:54.700]   then spend the rest of the money on two or three of these really amazing three, four,
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.300]   five thousand dollar watches.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.980]   So like, again, that's not, that's not a complaint about Apple watch.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:04.660]   That is another data point on my own ignorance about what do people like about a $10,000
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:05.660]   digital watch.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.660]   I am clueless.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.060]   All right, let's move on.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:15.940]   I think we've done our required, our requisite Apple watch half hour.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.020]   We're going to government regulations.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.580]   Government regulations require.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:25.500]   Half an hour each day on Apple watch until we get one and then we'll spend an hour or
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.300]   two or maybe not.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.940]   What's the chance that people get it and go, yeah, no, it doesn't work on bicycles.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.780]   Doesn't work on rowing machines.
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:35.780]   It's crappy.
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:40.220]   It's a percentage of people just like with the iPhone or iPad for which that is absolutely
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.220]   correct.
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.660]   And then there'll be a percentage of people who really like it.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.660]   It's going to.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:48.060]   You don't think that there is a risk that this could technologically be a flop.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.380]   No, they've had, I forget the exact number, like 2000, close to 3000 Apple employees, wearing
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.540]   them for six, three, four, five, six months.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.260]   They all love it.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.260]   Love them.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:07.180]   I mean, I know a couple of people who have them who are engineers and being able, actually,
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.660]   I was hanging out with a couple of them last week when I was or two weeks ago when I was
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.660]   in town in San Francisco for the event.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.500]   And it actually was really impressive to me just how naturally they were using the watch.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.460]   And in fact, I mean, they had specific instructions not to demo it to anybody.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:26.260]   So it wasn't like they were doing this just to be like, eh, look what I'm using.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.260]   Look at this.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.300]   It was just literally, you know, we're having dinner or something and they get a notification
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.220]   and they look at it really quickly and then they're like, all right, let's talk or, oh,
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:39.180]   let me program in directions or, you know, let me call an Uber.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.940]   Like it was, it was a lot of like really, really simple, really quick stuff.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.700]   Oh, but they were doing really interesting.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.700]   That's interesting.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:47.700]   And I think that they had it.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.180]   People are paying in stores with it and we'll say, well, what is that?
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.180]   What is that?
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.180]   Is that a sound?
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:55.820]   No, no, no, this is the Apple watch.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.940]   Enjoy it while you can because everybody's going to have it.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:03.260]   I wonder is it going to be, but the core stuff that people really respond to is it going
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:07.660]   to be materially better and easier to use than Android Wear?
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.460]   I'm going to say yes.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.820]   Notifications are really, really cool.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.180]   Voice commands are really, really cool.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.700]   What do you do above and beyond that?
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:21.300]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:27.820]   You know, I mentioned this before, but I feel like obligated to get two, one for me and
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:32.460]   one for my honey so that we can try it because, you know, I mean, I'm not going to be sending
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:33.460]   you my heartbeat, Renee.
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.460]   I got to tell you.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:37.060]   Leo, why must you hurt me?
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.060]   Okay.
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.620]   If you insist, I was just waiting for you to ask.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:45.460]   I just want to know that you're out there and that you're okay, Leo.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.460]   You're a sound of rapping though.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.780]   Someone gently tap on my watch.
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.100]   I just want to know that you haven't lost your ridiculous $10,000 watch that you just
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.100]   bought two days ago.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.740]   So if I don't get a heartbeat back, I know that you screwed up again.
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.220]   I'm going to have to tell them the top of the car.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.220]   What about you, serenity?
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:01.860]   Do you feel the need to get two, one for you and one for your sweetheart?
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.820]   I'm just going to get one because I know that my sweetheart is probably going to get one
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.820]   him to see.
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:07.820]   You see?
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.820]   You see?
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.820]   That's right.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:16.260]   I'm actually genuinely curious to try out the so-called gimmicky chat features.
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.260]   Yeah, me too.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.340]   Because as creepy as getting a heartbeat from a random person would be, I actually think
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.340]   it's a nice way.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:25.140]   I was talking about this last week.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.220]   It's a nice way to let the people in your life know of it.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.220]   Hi, Mom.
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:31.220]   I'm alive.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.820]   I landed on the plane.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.060]   I'm no longer sitting in an airport.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.060]   Whee.
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:40.500]   How has that been going, by the way?
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.140]   Have the parents agreed to get an Apple watch just so they'll hear from you?
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.420]   That's a good question.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.580]   I know my dad will probably get one.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.620]   I'm curious about my mother.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.620]   We'll see.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:53.620]   She really likes...
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:59.100]   I was going to say, "Gruber said his son is getting one so he can just tap on his wrist
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.020]   and tell his son he's waiting outside from to come out of school."
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.060]   Yeah, I think it's cool.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.500]   I think it's really cool.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   Text would work, too.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:11.660]   The text it bings or vibrates or does something that's less discreet.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:12.660]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.540]   Well, the other thing about text is, again, if you're driving, it's a lot easier for you
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:21.740]   to send a quick tap, tap, tap, tap, while you're driving rather than having to be like,
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:26.380]   "Ciri, tell my son that I'm going to pick him up in five minutes."
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:29.140]   There's more ways for that to get complicated.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:34.820]   I do wonder, though, if Android and other device makers will say, "Oh, this might be
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:39.020]   a whole area we could get into customized beeps or boops or buzzes."
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:43.820]   Actually, you can do customized buzzes, but I don't think you can trigger them via text.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.820]   Maybe you can.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   I bet you can, actually.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:51.100]   You can assign a customized vibration to a text message from Dad.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.180]   You can do that on the iPhone now.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.660]   You can set up custom vibration, but it's on your end.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.380]   The sender is not choosing what they send you.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.860]   You're choosing how it's received.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.940]   But that would be good enough for Gruber to text his son.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.060]   But it's still a buzzes in your pocket.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.940]   It's not a subtle tap.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.140]   It's not a taptic.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.140]   Andy?
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.460]   No, I was going to say exactly that.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.980]   I've experienced both kinds.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.900]   I don't think that the difference between the haptics that are on a watch like this
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:22.460]   and the taptics that are on the Apple Watch are miles apart, but it's sort of like how
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.060]   the MacBook Air has a fan.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.780]   The MacBook Nothing does not have a fan.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.740]   There's a difference between a taptic that is completely silent and the kind of a taptic
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.780]   that is almost completely silent.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.340]   That will be a defining thing, I think.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.180]   The pebble was loud.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.140]   This one is OK.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.620]   It's not a buzzer sort of thing.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.780]   If someone is close enough to me, they might hear something happening on my wrist.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.940]   There's something to be said for stealth.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.140]   Absolutely.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.860]   I'm excited about the Apple TV set top box.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.620]   I'm very interested what you guys think about this.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   The leak came from John Petchkowski, who is now working for BuzzFeed.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:10.580]   John still has the great connections and formerly at Recode.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:17.540]   Apparently has decided to affect kiss makeup.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.420]   He is the managing editor for BuzzFeed, San Francisco.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.420]   He says that.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.580]   Actually, he's repeating what the Wall Street Journal says.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:30.740]   I think BuzzFeed also got some of their own information that Apple is about to release
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:37.860]   at the Worldwide Developers Conference, a SDK for an App Store for a new Apple TV.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.140]   Gosh, Renee, it sounds like you just wrote about this.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.140]   Did you?
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.140]   Did Renee get that go?
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.140]   Who had that screw?
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.460]   I don't write scoops, Leo.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.380]   I posit the immediate future.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   I see.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.100]   You just guessed, but it's been confirmed.
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:59.060]   Well, a lot of this stuff is, John absolutely has great sources and he gets a lot of dates
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.060]   and things.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.460]   A lot of it is, we know what processors Apple has now.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.380]   We know what technologies like metal they have.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:09.020]   The SDK has been around for a couple of years and there's been renewed.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.420]   People are going to Apple to test stuff on the SDK now.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.980]   All this stuff is, a lot of rumors just really understanding the company well and reading
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:20.380]   the signs around Apple that sort of look at this stuff.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.460]   But a couple of weeks ago, I did something on the future of the Apple TV where you take
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.620]   a cyclone, you take the metal graphics stuff, you put it in a very nice box and you add
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.740]   an SDK to it.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.420]   It makes for a very compelling product.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:36.940]   It's probably higher end than we've seen before, which explains a lot of why the $69
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.380]   current generation Apple TV is just the beginning.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.780]   I think there's still a lot of questions about how it's going to be controlled.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.380]   You still have the remote app, the watch has a remote app, but if Apple's going into apps
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.740]   and gaming, how does that manifest?
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:52.620]   I think Mark on the show last week said that there's a slightly bigger controller, but
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.500]   is the MFI program ramping up so you can have substantial game controllers to play those
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.660]   games with?
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.380]   I have a lot of questions about it, but I think it's about time they get that box out.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.980]   They've been working on it for a couple of years.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.420]   We haven't been saying that'd be an app store, but I kind of had given up.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.860]   I just thought, oh, yeah, someday.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.620]   The projects had a lot of downs.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:17.020]   Yeah, I mean, the stories you hear about Apple TV are all about how they were hoping for
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.420]   X year and then they wait to the next year, and then they felt their window closed for
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.380]   that and now they're waiting for the next window to open.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.860]   And so you talk about playing the long game.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.620]   This is a par eight.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.620]   That Apple's playing with the TV.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:37.740]   Well, I mean, it had to also be the, there had to be enough demand, right, to satisfy what
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.380]   Apple wanted to do with the box.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.380]   And I do think it's interesting.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:46.580]   I think the HBO deal that they made is again, step one in kind of their master plan of
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:51.460]   let's see what we can do about the future of television and the future of content screaming
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:57.100]   and how we can kind of take that over and make that the best experience possible.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.260]   I've been hoping for an app.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.940]   I mean, we've all been hoping for an app store for years, for years and years and years.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.260]   But I do feel like this is probably the closest it's going to be.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.940]   Like this year is the best bet that we're going to have one in quite a while because
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:17.940]   Apple's not looking at any other major platforms besides watch in terms of apps and they're
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:23.460]   kind of setting the groundwork so that like WWDC seems like the perfect place to announce
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:29.540]   say an SDK for developing for Apple TV as well as developing for watch without just,
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.780]   you know, watch extensions.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.580]   It also Renee and I were talking about, you know, controllers because God knows like I
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.340]   lose that tiny little aluminum remote everywhere.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.900]   And I feel like everyone else does too.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.900]   It's tiny.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.380]   It says, yeah, that's fine.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.380]   That's right.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.940]   And the phone is unfortunately just not a great controller for it right now.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:54.620]   So in theory, having something like the watch is an interesting alternative controller for
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:05:01.140]   the for the television, being able to develop Siri further with the watch might be interesting
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.300]   as an option for the television.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:08.500]   Although I'm still skeptical about controlling things with voice when they can be triggered
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.580]   by the things that the TV itself is spewing.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:16.900]   See a hoi telephone anytime you like, I'm not actually going to say it because if I say
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.940]   it, I will trigger like 10 million people's phones and they're going to get mad at me.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.380]   But if you were to say the Siri keyword that would plug that would trigger a phone that's
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.420]   plugged in, that you know, that that irritates a lot of people and that happens.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.940]   So I can't imagine that the Siri commands for potential Apple TV would be allowed to
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.380]   be triggered without necessarily pushing a button first.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.700]   Yeah, I just, yeah, it's I have to go to nuance last week.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.140]   Nuance had an open house and they have a major office in Montreal and they were showing off
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:50.020]   a lot of what they were doing with living room with car with watch and things like that.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:53.100]   And they do something like called, it's not exactly, but it's like voice ID where they
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.300]   lock on a specific voice.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.660]   And it's almost, it can, they use it for bank app security.
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.700]   So it's at the point where it's almost like touch ID where they can really make sure it's
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.940]   you talking and not some random person.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.500]   And they also do things like beam forming where if it's in the living room product, you snap
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   twice and then all the microphones and if there's a camera lock on you and then isolates
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.900]   all other audio in the room.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.020]   So it's only you speaking.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:17.820]   There's a lot of technologies that already exist for this kind of thing to make technologies
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:23.260]   like Siri or Amazon's, I forget what it's called, the Echo product work in living rooms.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.020]   It's just a question of, is Apple going to adopt them?
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.460]   How fast are they going to adopt them?
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:31.580]   And there's also a case to be made and I tried making it the same article and I've got
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:35.780]   no information about Apple going ahead with this where you could take Apple TV logic and
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.980]   put that inside the phone.
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:41.020]   The way CarPlay lives inside the phone and then just have a little dongle, like a Google
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.660]   Chromecast dongle for people who really only want streaming.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.100]   I don't care if the stick by itself can do anything and then you just plug that in.
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.100]   Everything works on the phone.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.340]   It beams to the TV and that becomes a super cheap product.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.020]   And then you have sort of layers of Apple TV.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.820]   But I think there's a lot of room for them to act to do a lot of interesting stuff here.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.220]   So long as they just move forward with this.
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:07.580]   I mean, Apple has sometimes waiting for the right moment is Apple's greatest strength,
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   as with the phone, as with tablets, as with what I referred to as Apple's netbook.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:17.680]   And sometimes you're just delaying something and letting more, more brave people make more
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.940]   awesome things than you.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:23.380]   Because right now the Apple TV is, it's not a piece of junk, but it really looks like
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:29.100]   it belongs in like Obama's first term as opposed to a box like the Roku that maybe doesn't
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.940]   have the perfect app store environment.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.220]   But it means that sling player can have a sling box app.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.500]   But Ariel can have an area app.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.860]   Everybody can roll their own apps for pretty much anything.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:43.300]   I can have an app that will attach to automatically find all the media on all the servers on
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.380]   my house.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.940]   And that wasn't necessarily a built in feature of the Roku, but I was able to simply install
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.420]   this with one click.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:55.000]   And so it's you we wonder how long people are going to have to wait to get what is what
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.380]   other people would consider basic functionality while Apple tries to figure out what's the
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.300]   perfect way to do an app store.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:04.900]   What's the way that benefits the entire ecosystem more than the way the way we're going to do
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900]   it last year?
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.820]   So it's Apple.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.380]   Apple I think is smart enough to know that people are going to buy Apple TV once they
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.300]   produce the final package.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.100]   So it's not as though people are going to be running elsewhere and never buying Apple
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:22.540]   TVs, but it's too bad that the people who did buy Apple TVs a few years ago have to
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:26.740]   deal with a seriously substandard product for many years.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:30.420]   We should mention that when you say it's Obama, you're you're not talking about the physical
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.340]   design, which actually is very nice and looks like I think about the UI.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:39.340]   I mean, the suck where the UI, the speed of it, the fact that I have I have my Roku is
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.340]   on HDMI one.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.420]   My Apple TV is on HDMI two.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:48.300]   And sometimes I will flick over to that to do something or to check out some Apple content.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.260]   And it's like, Oh my God, what's that thing I'm looking at?
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.940]   I haven't seen it in years on that screen.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:53.060]   Oh, that's right.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.860]   It's a spinning, please wait cursor.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.700]   It's like, Oh, it's a please wait as we authenticate you box.
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.540]   Oh, I have not seen that in like several months.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.540]   Isn't that adorable?
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:07.260]   I remember when I was young and innocent and boy, everyone been coaxed used to comic
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.460]   books used to be 89 cents.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.740]   That's the last time I saw one of those.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:15.980]   Not to not to excuse anything, but the Apple TV is under eddy Q, which is very different
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.940]   dynamic than the iPhones or the iPads.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.100]   And it probably means that they're more susceptible to things like content deals holding them
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.100]   up.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.820]   And I think we talked about this before.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.500]   There's no universal search on the Apple TV.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.860]   Other boxes have it.
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.820]   Apple apparently is not allowed doing it the same way that we're not getting DRM free
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:34.140]   MP3s when other people like Amazon were allowed getting them.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:38.220]   So the way that that product is set up puts an awful lot of constraints and a lot of
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.940]   different pressures on them that may be something like the iPhone or iPad, you know, doesn't
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.900]   have to deal with in this general yearly cycle.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.580]   Oh, two quick responses.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.380]   Consumers absolutely don't care about that.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.420]   No, absolutely.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.860]   And secondly, okay, so broke.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.140]   Okay, I shouldn't get into it.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.500]   It's like I acknowledge that possibility.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.940]   And that's a good point.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:04.460]   However, if they willfully read the contracts that they signed and said that we're not going
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.420]   to allow voice search, we're not going to allow this.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.300]   We're not going to allow apps on this.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:09.820]   That was a dumb thing to do.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:13.500]   Just as stupid as having a remote that's about as thin as a slice of processed cheese
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.220]   and making that the standard remote.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.500]   So I don't I will be happy.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.940]   You will be happier at this this summer.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.940]   Good.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   Good point.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.940]   I believe so too.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.940]   Fingers crossed.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.740]   But let's let's keep our fingers crossed.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:32.660]   I alongside Renee, I'm very I believe that we're going to be happy with what we see at
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.660]   WWDC.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.820]   All right.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.940]   And do you think that they're going to make the content deals?
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.740]   Because that's I think a lot of what we're talking about here as a Canadian.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.740]   Do I think that I'll know you're not going to get crap.
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.740]   We know that.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.740]   Sorry, Renee.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.820]   Bad news, Renee.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.540]   Yeah, I think you guys will get stuff.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]   NBC.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.620]   So the rumors we and we think we've talked about this, but that NBC is not going to play
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.900]   along with the others will blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.900]   Accurate.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.820]   ABC doesn't yield beyond board.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.820]   We know we know the ABC.
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.620]   I mean, NBC is a question.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:12.700]   I know they're they're heavily invested in Hulu and that sort of avenue.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:17.020]   But you also have to remember that all of these all of these networks are kind of two
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.700]   partner arms, right?
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.500]   You've got the actual broadcast networks and then you've got the networks that own the
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.260]   shows that are developing and sometimes those are the same networks and sometimes those
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.260]   are different.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:33.100]   A great example of this is the sort of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which has been like
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:37.140]   a huge, huge blow up hit for Netflix.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:43.900]   That's actually produced and owned by NBC by NBC studios in NBC Universal Comcast, whatever
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.780]   the the super umbrella is called now.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.540]   NBC sold that show to Netflix for distribution rights.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.700]   So there's there's stuff like that where I think that I think that although Apple may
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:59.300]   not be able to make traditional content deals directly with the networks, they may still
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:05.660]   be able to get some of their shows by making individual deals for those specific those
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:08.060]   specific areas.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:12.620]   I wonder how people react to the I wonder if people react to these sort of packages the
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:17.940]   same way or differently than I react to them where broadcast TV and cable have their problems,
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:23.260]   but you pay a very, very simple fee or pay nothing and I get NBC, I get ABC, I get CBS,
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.940]   I get Fox, I get PBS, I get a couple other stations.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.420]   It's not, well, we're going to give you ABC and NBC.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:33.220]   We don't we get we can give you CBS news in 60 minutes, but we can't give you the big
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.420]   bang theory which you like.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:38.380]   David Letterman show, you're going to have to go to the website to get that.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:45.500]   It's the the the the uncrackable coconut here is give me everything I want in one package
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.180]   instead of having to launch separate apps or even separate devices to get there.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.380]   And I'm not sure that it's such a fragmented set of deals between all these different content
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.380]   providers that it might even be an unattainable thing in the next five or six years.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.020]   Just please the customer.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.020]   I did.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.900]   Just to show you how weird it is.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:08.020]   I have I haven't done stuff with CBS network morning show in a few years, but I was going
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:13.300]   to demonstrate a video app and I had ripped a app from a certain very popular CBS show.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.900]   I figured, well, okay, but then I have to get that get permission to use that.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.860]   And they said, well, here are the shows you can use.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.300]   We don't have really asked permission with.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.420]   We don't have a good relationship with this one show.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.620]   And it's like, okay, I'll get something else.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.940]   But like I know this is a really popular network owned show.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.940]   Like, okay.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.540]   Well, that and that's because it's produced outside the network.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.820]   Oh, no, I don't want to give anything away.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:37.820]   It was okay.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:41.660]   I'll say is it surprised me that it would even though it would have in this case, it
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.540]   would have been I'll walk three blocks away from where from your studio right now to talk
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.460]   to this people at this studio to see if get permission.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:53.740]   It's like, no, that this even though the three blocks away, we just it's easier just
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.980]   if you just use something else.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:55.980]   Like, okay.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.860]   So it's really complicated.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.740]   So credit where credit is due.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.340]   Renee predicted it, but Buzzfeed confirmed it.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.900]   Well, it's like John's got awesome sauce.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.900]   With their sources.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.900]   They have awesome sauces.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.260]   They have awesome sauces and sauces.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.820]   I didn't realize, but you know, I saw that Buzzfeed had broken this door and I thought,
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.500]   wow, I don't usually see Buzzfeed break stuff.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.220]   And then I saw that pass job, like Chowski went over there.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.620]   I got a home and running their West Coast Bureau.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.020]   I saw that Matt Holmes went over there.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.660]   He collected a bunch of things.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.660]   Wow.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.660]   Good people.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:30.260]   I hope they snap up some other good people like the some of the Mac world staff.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.700]   Of course, serenity's already been snapped.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.260]   I think most of us are in a.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.820]   Are they somewhere good?
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.820]   The positions now.
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.820]   Yeah, we have a giggle.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.860]   Now we have a home to get jobs.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.500]   Those poor guys.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.500]   I think we're close.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.860]   Just knocked up one of the really the gig.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.860]   Oh, good.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.300]   That's kind of inside baseball, but our friends.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.620]   So we like to talk about them.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:55.700]   And I think probably your friends too, since a lot of them are on these shows.
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.700]   Apple.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.700]   Now, tell me about this.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.620]   We talked about this yesterday on iPad today.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:05.620]   Apple seems to be yanking antivirus apps from the iOS app store in Tigo said we've been
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.620]   yanked.
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:11.460]   Lookout was apparently yanked according to a nine to five Mac.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:22.620]   If you search for these antiviruses, you'll only see games or find my iPhone esque apps.
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.780]   And Tigo says the takedown was the whole category.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.140]   And Tigo makes the virus barrier.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:33.420]   On the one hand, you might say, well, this is Apple PR saying, oh, well, you don't need
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   an antivirus.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.620]   But the way Apple designs iOS, it may in fact be that any virus can't actually do anything.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.620]   Yeah, those apps were.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:50.220]   No, I am inclined to agree with you, Leo, in that there's very little that an antivirus
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.220]   app can really do on iOS.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:55.740]   I don't know, Renee, do you want to you know a little bit more about those super technical
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.740]   aspects than I do?
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:02.580]   Well, it's a couple of the posts of the people whose apps were taken away weren't very outraged.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.140]   They're more like, oh, yeah.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.900]   We weren't really doing anything.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:06.820]   Yeah, we weren't doing it.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.300]   We were checking your email attachments if they were stored on the cloud in this way or
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.300]   that way.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.700]   And we understand why it could be confusing that people think they're buying antivirus
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.780]   like they're used to from their computer and it doesn't do that.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.220]   Here's one thing I would like.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.940]   And let me tell me if this is possible.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.500]   And this is really mostly what happens on Android too.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.460]   Most most of the time on Android, though so-called antivirus apps are not doing what
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.980]   antiviruses do on computers.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.740]   They're not scanning for looking for virus signatures.
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:38.140]   They only check downloads against a database of known malware and flag it if it's there.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.140]   Isn't that?
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:43.740]   They kill the battery in a second if they did the same things that desktop app did so.
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:44.740]   Right.
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.380]   And in the case of iOS, they don't have the, they can't scan the file system.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.540]   Nothing can except Apple.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.580]   But I'll give you an example and this is why I mentioned this.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:17:00.340]   You know about Freak which is an exploit that basically is a downgrade in encryption technology
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.180]   exploit that takes advantage of servers.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.580]   You have to, you have to have a malformed server in a malformed app talking together.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:12.060]   All the browsers now, including Safari and iOS have been patched.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:16.340]   So they're not vulnerable to Freak but Freak would allow a man in the middle to see what
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.100]   you're doing in SSL and steal, steal stuff.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:24.420]   But according to this article by Dan Gooden, who's very good in ours, Technica, he's actually
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:29.060]   talking about a fire eye, a study fire eye also very good.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.100]   They searched Google Play and Apple App Store.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:38.180]   They found 1,228 Android apps with 1 million or more downloads were vulnerable to Freak.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:40.980]   771 of the top iOS apps.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.660]   That's, they only scanned the top 15,000, 14,000 are susceptible.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:50.700]   That's 771 apps that could quite reasonably be in a database for Intigo or somebody else
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.980]   to say, Hey, you have on your, on your iPhone, a vulnerable app.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.940]   You might want to consider not using it.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:58.940]   That would be.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.860]   I don't think viruses are a problem on any mobile platform, but this is an example of
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.780]   where a security program, let's not say antivirus, could be very useful.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.980]   Can any iOS app do that kind of thing, Renee?
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:16.380]   No, I mean, there's very, very few things that actually have unrestricted background
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.260]   access and one of them is like audio streaming.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.420]   And anyone who's used Skype on iOS knows what, you know, if that, if there's anything
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.020]   ever goes wrong with that, your battery, like Andy said earlier, just starts diminishing
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.980]   because it's just these, these machines were not designed to do that kind of thing.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:34.220]   But moreover, all those apps, at least in iOS, if they're using the default web view, as
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:38.300]   soon as iOS is updated, all those apps are updated because they're, they're not creating
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.460]   their own web browser.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:43.780]   They're pulling apples, UI web view or now WK, the web kit version, web view.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.860]   No, but but iOS has been patched.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:51.180]   iOS 8.2 is freak free, but those apps remain vulnerable.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:52.940]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:58.340]   I didn't read the following clause when they run on earlier versions of iOS.
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.340]   So you're exactly right.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.940]   They're using WebKit, which has been patched.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.980]   So it's only an issue on older iOS version.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.820]   Those are probably abandoned apps that wouldn't be okay.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:13.580]   He did say that seven of the 771 apps, so seven apps on iOS are susceptible to freak
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.900]   even on iOS 8.2.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:21.940]   Now they didn't, unfortunately, they didn't identify those, unfortunately.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:27.940]   So now my question is, so you're saying because an app can't run in the background, there's
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:33.860]   no way Lookout or Intigo could say, well, let me see if you have one of those seven
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:34.860]   apps.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:35.940]   They can't do it unless you run them, right?
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.940]   If you were.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.980]   No, yeah, they could, they could make an app.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.860]   There's different ways to detect what apps are on your phone.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:46.940]   Some people use the, I forget what it's called the URL scheme to determine if an app is registered,
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:50.260]   that URL with a system and other ones try to read what background tasks are running and
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.260]   they try to present you with it.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.500]   That antivirus or security app would have to be running in the foreground, couldn't run
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.500]   the background.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.820]   You have to open it up and yeah, and then look and then it would have to look and compare
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.180]   that against its list and you hope that its lists were updated and no false positives
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.180]   or negatives.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180]   Right.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:08.580]   Yeah, admittedly it's only seven apps out of 14,000, but it's still seven apps.
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:10.700]   And that's just the top 14,000.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.500]   These are the top apps downloaded.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.260]   These are not the millions of apps on the app store.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:19.500]   We don't know how many of those are implicated.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:25.620]   So there is a, the, my point being there is a use and even a capability for a security
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.340]   program to run on iOS.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.340]   Yeah, but then you get into that.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.820]   I think Steve's missions before is once you start granting access, then bad guys start
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.060]   using the same access.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:38.060]   But without, without additional access, I could make a security program that would check
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.820]   at least for those seven apps, but it's now.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:45.820]   And then so then the second part of the question is, is Apple blocking those antiviruses?
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.860]   Is it blocking a program like that?
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:54.700]   They don't allow, they only allow voice over IP background navigation and streaming audio
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.300]   as full background APIs.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.300]   The rest is all in demand.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.300]   I understand.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.300]   No, I understand.
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.300]   So I'm acknowledging that.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.860]   But I'm saying I could still write an app that would via URL schemes or some other technique
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.900]   when it's in the foreground, when it's running, check to see if there's bad apps on my phone.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.260]   Yeah, you'd have to submit it and we'd see if they'd approve it or not.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:13.460]   I don't know of any apps that do that already.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.620]   Also you compare with everything like this, even in the real world you compare what is
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.900]   the actual level of threat and what is the amount of trouble and the amount of inconvenience
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.380]   and the amount of insecurity you're willing to introduce in order to attack that threat.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:31.620]   And because malware on the iPhone is not a problem at this point, it seems like a bad
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.740]   move to try to make a great company.
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:39.540]   And without opening any holes or without in any way modifying the iPhone as it works
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:45.100]   today, you could have a security app that would find seven programs no one should be
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.820]   using on iOS.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.940]   Those seven programs are in the app store according to FireEye.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.820]   It is conceivable of a program that would do that.
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.340]   So I'm not asking to open holes.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.540]   I'm not saying there is no malware.
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:03.660]   It's not exactly malware, but there are programs you should not run on iOS in the app store.
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.860]   Or you could make it, you just have to submit it and see if they approve it and if they
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.660]   approve it, if they leave it approved.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.660]   I mean, don't you agree, Andy?
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.540]   If such a thing existed, you should be allowed to download it.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:19.100]   I have to be careful here because I'm half remembering something someone told me a couple
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:24.580]   of years ago about how an app with that function would work and an explanation of why that
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:26.220]   would not be a good thing.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:31.900]   But I stress it, I stress that I'm half remembering it and it might be bold to begin with.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:36.540]   So that's why I have to simply say I would not be surprised if it turned out that that
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.740]   was a bad idea.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.820]   But I have also, but it's possible that you're right.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.900]   There's no reason for them not to do it.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:47.060]   So Renee has posited what is always the only way to find out what Apple will allow.
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.060]   Just try it.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.540]   You have to write it, you have to submit it and then see what they do with it.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:51.540]   Right.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.460]   Yeah, it's possible that Apple will bring the same sort of malware.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:56.740]   Like on OS 10, they already scanned from malware and it's conceivable that that sort
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.820]   of system would come from Apple themselves as some.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.100]   Yeah, and they do that.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.140]   Google does that on Android as well.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:05.100]   But there are additional apps like Lookout is an example on Android.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.460]   I don't know what Lookout does on iOS, but on Android, that's exactly what Lookout does.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.460]   It has a database of known apps.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.460]   You shouldn't be running.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:16.100]   It includes those 221 or 1441.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:20.260]   See, I ran those on Windows and I would always like once in a while they get updated definitions
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:23.820]   and it would suddenly flag like Win32 as a bad app.
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.620]   So it's hard to educate people about the intricacies of that stuff.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.740]   Also, that's part of the advantage of that.
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.700]   That's part of what's possible with Android.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.900]   That's not possible with iOS.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:39.500]   Android is the why go West with which is both like Homer Simpson's definition of beer
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.740]   as the cause of and solution to all our problems.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:46.140]   The openness of Android means that it lets in the possibility of malware, but also lets
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.980]   in the possibility of writing apps that combat malware.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:49.980]   Right.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:52.180]   Hello, Kitty.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:57.940]   I just want all I'm asking and there is no answer is Apple doing this to sort of a PR
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   move.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.940]   Hey, there's no viruses.
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:01.940]   I don't think so.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:02.940]   Okay.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.540]   That's just that's just my article of faith.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.540]   We've had enough history with them to know that they don't tend to.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.540]   I can't remember.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:13.700]   I can't think of a single instance in which they've been anated an app simply for PR reasons,
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.820]   even when it looked like, Oh, well, look, look how you're now turning down this Google
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:22.460]   Play app or we're now turning down this this a comicsology app that sells content.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:24.980]   No, it's not because they wanted to keep Google Play out.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:29.500]   It's because that they had a link to their store that is not allowed in for any developer
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:30.500]   in any circumstances.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.500]   Right.
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.100]   So that's why my default position until shown otherwise is that Apple is not using app store
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.060]   approvals in any sort of a strategic way.
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.780]   And said they're cracking down an antivirus apps and Tigo says they are.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.380]   And Tigo has a little bit of a dog in this hunt since it makes an antivirus app.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:49.820]   And I think it's just as likely that Apple says, you know what, there's no way an antivirus
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.700]   app could actually be useful on iOS because we've structured it that way.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.220]   So we're just going to kick them all off.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.660]   In other words, these apps are snake oil.
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.660]   They don't do anything.
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.660]   This is the question.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:02.300]   Why did they get approved in the first place?
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:05.860]   Just like there was a moment there was a moment when you could get a fart app approved.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.780]   And then Apple said, look, we really don't want to see any more of these.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.380]   We don't think they're good for anybody.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:16.940]   No, I there's a conversation that I might not be able to talk about of someone who had
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.900]   of it was it wasn't a fart app.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.020]   It was a fart adjacent app.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.020]   Okay.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:28.300]   Where that an app that simply tapped into the universal and accessible humor of bodily
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.300]   gas emissions.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.940]   So it wasn't like, Hey, look, what?
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:32.180]   Look at the noises it's make.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.660]   It was part of a game in which there was a farting could have been part of the humor
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.820]   of the game.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.940]   And Apple rejected it because they said, no, no, no, faulting, no faulting.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:41.940]   We would not have thought.
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.500]   You throw your thoughts out.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.220]   I think I think Steve wrote that into the rules and you can actually see that.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.220]   It was a new one by Steve Jobs.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:52.220]   Hard apps and flashlights.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.220]   No flashlights.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.820]   We don't need them anymore because it's in the.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.940]   Yeah, we've got the we've got control center.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:04.340]   Honestly, I mean, I think that some of those apps that are now being taken off the store,
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.580]   they again, they had potential uses in that, you know, if you give them access to your
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:13.580]   email, you give them access to your contacts, they can screen through, you know, potential,
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.540]   potential bad attachments or things like that.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:21.460]   But ultimately that's, that's not necessarily something that a third party app should be
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.700]   doing on iOS.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.060]   Can I ask you guys a question?
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:31.100]   Because you're the experts on the new photos app, which will be out in 10, 10, three, which
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.300]   will be out soon, right?
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:36.140]   We think seems like it's done soonish.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.500]   As you said, there was another update yesterday.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.140]   It wasn't there to the beta.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:46.660]   It used to be when I hooked up my, this is a stupid question and it's completely my question,
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.260]   but maybe somebody else listening has had the same issue.
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:55.300]   When I hooked up the iPhone to the computer and copied my photos off, I photos would say,
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.460]   okay, would you like to delete those photos from your phone?
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:02.620]   And I would say yes, because I don't want thousands of photos on my phone jamming up
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.620]   the works.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.780]   I've already copied them to the computer.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.220]   Photos doesn't seem to ask that.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.540]   Is there any way to get rid of these old photos?
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:13.700]   That's an old way of thinking Leo.
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.180]   The new way of thinking is that Apple will near line manage it for you.
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.180]   So those photos aren't really on your phone anymore.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:21.660]   Anyway, it's just the most popular and recently accessed ones and the rest are in the magical
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.660]   clouds.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:23.660]   What do you mean they're not on my phone anyway?
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.660]   I took them.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:26.660]   Yeah, but you're using.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.100]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:33.340]   Yeah, if you're using iCloud Photo Library, basically what will happen, you have optimized
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.500]   storage turned on.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:38.420]   What will happen is a certain percentage of those photos that you took will remain in
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.340]   full quality on your phone.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:45.020]   And then everything after say like 200 photos will go automatically up to the cloud.
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.140]   And all you'll see is a tiny little thumbnail that if you want to see it, you just tap on
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:51.420]   it and then it pulls it down from the cloud.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.820]   Or if you want it to make sure that it stays on your device, you tap the, you know, the
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:58.740]   favorite heart and that it permanently stays on your device.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:04.380]   But otherwise, yeah, Apple is really trying to get people away from the idea of we want
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.540]   you to delete photos once you've taken them.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:12.380]   It should be that in theory, the magical software that is on your device manages this
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.380]   all for you.
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.500]   So you never have to worry about, oh, I'm losing space.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.820]   Oh, I have too little space.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:21.140]   Oh, I've taken too many photos and nothing's backed up.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.620]   Everything should be automatically backed up.
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.100]   Everything, you know, that's good.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:28.980]   Because I do know many, many people who just leave everything on their iPhone and then they
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.700]   complain, oh my God, my iPhone's full thinking about this way.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.900]   Oh, if you deleted the photos, it would just think them back anyway.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:35.620]   So it's saving you the pain of us.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.620]   All right.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.620]   But okay.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:42.340]   So let me show people if you go into settings, photos and camera, you need to have iPhone
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:43.620]   iCloud photo library.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:50.060]   And then by the way, still says beta turned on and optimize phone storage checked.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:54.620]   And then it will only keep the last few hundred and it'll opt to put a little optimized
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.620]   thumbnail.
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.940]   It'll do all the things you want.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:00.020]   What if you don't have those checked and set?
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.300]   Well, you're probably not using, I mean, if you're using that and not using the photos
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.580]   beta, that'd be an odd combination.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:09.260]   But let's say when this comes out, is this going to, will there be a way in photos to
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.260]   delete?
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:14.340]   Oh, so you can still delete your images.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.140]   But yeah, but I mean, you're talking about deleting them period.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.380]   I want to delete them from the phone because they're taking up a lot of space.
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:25.020]   And I don't want to use iCloud photo library beta.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.860]   How do I do that?
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.900]   So if you're going to do that and you're going to have iCloud photo library turned off, which
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:32.660]   is totally an, that is an option.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:37.860]   When you connect your phone to the photos app, if as long as you have both iCloud, if you
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:42.300]   have iCloud photo library turned off in both places, it should treat your phone just like
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.980]   a regular old camera.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.300]   So we'll get, it will offer me the option to delete.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.300]   It should in theory.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:52.260]   Yeah, I haven't personally tested it, but I suspect that's the way it will work.
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:55.060]   And then worst case, you can always use image capture.
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:58.300]   And image capture allows you to delete and you are image capture.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.820]   So image capture continues to have those capabilities.
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:01.820]   Correct.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:02.820]   Good.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:04.820]   And I photo an aperture.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.820]   But I photos going to go away as is aperture.
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:09.380]   And hopefully just preparing for.
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:10.860]   I'm preparing for you downloaded it.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.660]   I'm preparing for the new photos future.
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:16.420]   And I was just surprised because in past I've copied it off.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.940]   And I photo said, now do you want to delete them?
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:19.940]   And I never saw that.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:23.740]   It's a mental lead because it really would be deleting those photos just to happen to
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.340]   say back again, because the state of the phone is no longer.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:27.420]   Those are just the photos you took.
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.340]   Those are all they really want a world where photos is an OS level service and it's all
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.020]   your photos and all your devices on demand.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.420]   That's not congruous with deleting them off.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.940]   I love our chatroom.
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:42.820]   Scooter X is saying, well, in the new iOS 8.3 B today, it no longer says iCloud photo
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.140]   library beta.
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.900]   But I might point out Scooter X, the whole freaking thing is beta.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.580]   So you're a beta.
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.580]   You're a beta.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:51.580]   It's all beta.
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.940]   So of course it doesn't have to say beta there.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:58.660]   We'll see when 8.3 comes out if it stops saying beta.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:04.860]   Apple has just seeded the second public build of iOS 8.3 beta fourth beta for iOS beta.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.860]   Where's your beta going?
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.700]   In case you want.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.500]   And am I so maybe I'm done.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:14.300]   Is there a button in the phone that says delete these photos?
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.900]   If you delete them on the phone, again, if you're living in the iCloud photo library
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.460]   world, there's no phone anymore.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.460]   All your photos are everywhere.
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.660]   So if you delete them, you're deleting them from everywhere.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.900]   Otherwise, the phone is going to manage.
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.660]   But I know I can delete them one by one.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:30.100]   I can click on the photo and delete it.
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:36.340]   But if I have 3,000 photos, which I did, that was kind of onerous.
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:39.220]   But if you're using iCloud photo library, you're not deleting them from your phone.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:40.540]   You're deleting them from iCloud photo.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.020]   Everywhere, which is OK in this case.
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:47.220]   As easier to do in photos in Mac, you can just select huge amounts of stuff and delete
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.220]   them.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:50.220]   Ah, yeah, on the Mac.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.780]   All right.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:52.780]   Or you can pick home moments.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:55.020]   I think you can still go to moments or collections and choose them.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:59.580]   And I just think about people who have like a 16 gig iPhone or a 32 gig.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.580]   That's the beauty of iCloud.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:03.380]   I mean, that's supposedly the beauty of iCloud photo library.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.180]   I mean, in terms of the way that it optimizes storage, there's no specific amount that
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:10.460]   it takes away.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:14.540]   It is entirely dynamically based on how big of a phone you have.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:20.620]   So if you have 16 gigabytes, for example, and 8 gigabytes of that is taken up by music,
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:23.020]   it'll only sink a small amount of photos.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.620]   But if you have more space available, it'll dump a few more photos.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:31.700]   And it automatically prioritizes based on whatever photos you've been looking at most
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.500]   recently or editing most recently, which I think is really cool.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:40.500]   It's great.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.660]   That's great.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:44.820]   Because then it just happens and you don't know about it and you're happy.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:50.660]   But there are people foolishly like me who say, but I don't know where's the button to
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.100]   delete them all.
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.100]   And it's a little frustrating.
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:59.060]   And it makes me feel stupid because I'm going, isn't there a select all where, how do I?
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.340]   Well, I mean, you can delete all of the photos on your phone.
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:06.420]   If you want to turn off iCloud Photo Library and that one, you can't worry about that
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.420]   segment.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:09.420]   No, no, no.
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:10.420]   There's a select all.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.420]   Well, okay.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.220]   So there's a section in moments.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:18.220]   So if you go to the Photos app and you go to photos collections.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.220]   I'm in moments.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.220]   I'm in moments.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.220]   You have to go to collections and moments.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:23.220]   I believe.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.220]   And you press select.
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.220]   And then you can one by one.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:29.460]   At the top of, well, you see at the top of that, there's a plane that says select.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:30.460]   Yes.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.300]   The other is like, it turns from, it's really the press select.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:34.300]   There's one select.
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.300]   Select.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.820]   And then there's little selects under each moment.
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:38.820]   You see that?
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:39.820]   I have to go like this.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.300]   Oh, oh, you can go moment by moment.
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.700]   Ah.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:49.220]   So if I go moment by, well, I still have to, if you have a lot of moments, that's still
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:50.980]   something, but it's better than nothing.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.980]   Okay.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:54.780]   So there's no select all, but you can select by all by moment.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:55.780]   Mm hmm.
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:00.660]   And if, and that means I only have to go back 365 days.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.660]   365 selects.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.220]   Okay.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:07.620]   And then worst case scenario, you just plug your phone into your computer and use image
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:09.340]   capture and delete it all.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.340]   That's probably what I'll end up doing.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.340]   Turn off the sync so it doesn't all sync back.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:16.300]   I'm already, and then, and then it will come back.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:21.980]   So sometimes just works doesn't for people who are paying attention.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:23.180]   That's the problem with cloud services.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:27.860]   If you do them wrong, it's like having pantry moths in your house where you feel like you
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.020]   can get rid of all them.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:32.020]   At some point there's, they're back and you don't know how they got back.
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.020]   Pantry moths.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.100]   Launcher is back to the band iOS widget that let you launch other apps is back.
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:40.100]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:43.420]   I have mixed feelings, but I think it would be who've Apple to make extensions for control
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:48.020]   center and then allow you to like developers to make apps that go into control center.
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.860]   Because control center feels to me like where I want to go to launch apps and notification
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:54.260]   center feels like where I want to go for information.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:35:01.420]   I just, you know, it's, I'd like to let users decide that because I do swipe down to get
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:04.660]   a look at, to get a look at an overview sort of things.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.460]   In any, in any event there needs to be a place to put favorite apps because the current app
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.420]   launcher is just terrible.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:12.980]   It's just, it's not the greatest.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:17.300]   It's, it is exactly like what the Newton message pad had in the late 1990s.
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:20.020]   And I think we can do a little bit better than that.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:24.260]   It's a crazy dreamer with, with too much faith in Apple, but I think they can surpass what
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.140]   happened 20 years ago.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:33.180]   Survey says 85% of iPhone six owners in the US have never tried Apple pay.
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:36.460]   I was just looking at that.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.220]   I'm a little from payments.com.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.220]   I don't know.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.620]   They don't, they don't context for it.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.340]   Like how does that relate to other service?
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:44.060]   Well, maybe they haven't tried Amex.
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.060]   I don't, I don't know.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:51.140]   I'll point out that this was a, not exactly scientific survey, it was a survey of 1,188
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:57.580]   participants of the payments.com innovation project 2015 mobile payments conference.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:02.500]   But, but now, well, you would expect those people would be like high adult.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.500]   You like high adult.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:04.500]   All trying it.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.540]   9% said they played around with Apple pay.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.020]   I'm in that work for currency.
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:10.580]   I mean, if they all work for currency.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:12.580]   That's, that's a question though.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.580]   It's like, who's attending?
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:17.700]   To Google payments.com because I don't know much about them.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:23.620]   But if the, if the folks attending the innovation project 2015 mobile payments conference, if
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:29.620]   75% of them have Android and the, you know, people surveyed were, you know, the, let's
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:36.100]   say 85% of the 150 people who have iPhones at the conference, like that might be a little
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:37.100]   bit different.
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.420]   Here's why this is, I agree.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.660]   This is a useless number because of the way it was performed.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:47.020]   But it's not a non believable number to me because I am an iPhone user who has set up
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:50.500]   three or four credit cards in Apple pay and I've never used it.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.780]   Just because, you know, even when I'm at Whole Foods where I could use it, it's like,
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:54.780]   yeah, whatever.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:55.780]   I know how this works.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:57.420]   I don't want to mess with it.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:02.820]   I'll also, I don't, I don't like the nature of that headline where it really wants to pay,
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:06.060]   paint Apple pay as a failure because of low, low adoption.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.740]   When, when really there are going to be so many factors like where do you shop and does the
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.860]   place where you shop happen to take Apple pay?
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:17.220]   And if you are, you just simply wired up to simply say, I know they've got two objects
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:19.260]   in my pocket, one is a phone, one is a wallet.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.980]   I'm going to suppress the natural instinct to pay with my wallet and now take my phone.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:28.900]   I am one of those nuts who uses Google wallet all the time because I just like it.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:31.300]   I like the security and also I will admit it.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:34.020]   I like the fun of paying for something with my phone.
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:38.500]   But it's really going to take a number of years for people simply to change their habits
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:42.260]   and it's going to take a device like Apple Watch, I think, to get people really on board
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:45.620]   with this idea that here's a more convenient way of paying for things.
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.980]   And I should say I also had Google wallet in touch to play with Google Wallet for a long
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.820]   time and never use that either.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:53.860]   I use it constantly.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.340]   I'm on that exact same page.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:02.340]   My Nexus 5 had both wireless charging and the ability to pay for things with NFC.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:06.700]   And I use neither of those things over the past, like almost two years until like just
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:09.860]   a couple of months ago when I realized, oh, that's right.
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.100]   I can charge this more easily.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:11.980]   Oh, that's right.
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:14.220]   I can you with Apple Pay news.
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:15.700]   I have always been able to do that.
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:18.060]   I wonder how well that works.
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:22.220]   Again, it's such a like we're talking about earlier with the Apple Watch.
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:24.660]   So much of the problem is not engineering.
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.580]   It's just educating people.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:28.460]   And here's something that is possible.
[01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:32.980]   And here's why you want to break a 10 year old habit and start a new much better habit.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.620]   I would say just judging from the what I'm seeing in the chat or most of the people in
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.100]   the chat room who have the capability have used Apple Pay.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.220]   But again, that's a self selected group.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:48.180]   Gardner in the chat room said it's in a survey taken at WWDC.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:50.900]   Google was found not to have sold a single phone.
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.420]   Yeah, you know, it's yeah.
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:57.420]   As someone doesn't have Apple Pay yet, but we have we've had contactless payment for
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:58.420]   years here.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.940]   I it's just ubiquitous.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.180]   Everybody goes in whenever they use it.
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:03.620]   And most of the time you just I use I tap to pay all the time.
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:07.540]   I can't remember the last time once in a while I have to put the pin and chip in because
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.420]   they've dropped the machine and and the NSC is not working anymore.
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:12.940]   But I say 90% of the time I tap the gas tank.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:15.620]   I tap the you know the rest at the fast food place.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620]   I tap at the coffee shop.
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.620]   I tap at the rest.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.620]   I mean it just it's all I do.
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.220]   I suspect it actually upset.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:28.620]   There's a one the the Panera closest to me where I do a lot of my like field writing.
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:34.420]   I've got four terminals of which one does not have contactless payments and whenever they
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:39.180]   say next please it's always the clerk with the non I'm standing there with my phone in
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.180]   my hand.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.180]   Oh, God damn it.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.580]   I got I got to get my wallet on.
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:44.620]   I actually have money with me.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.220]   It's like I'm actually curious to see if it's going to be as reliable as the card because
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:53.100]   the last time I was at I forget I was at a breed our equivalent of Chipotle here and
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.700]   the guy in front of me was trying to get his phone to pay and he kept saying, Oh, hold
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:56.700]   on a second.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:57.700]   Oh, hold on a second.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:01.020]   I just hit my cart and left because you know old analog card always works doesn't need
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:02.940]   an interface doesn't need any input.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:06.020]   So it'd be interesting for me to see just how different it is when it's when it's on
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.020]   the phone.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.060]   Patrick Delahandy in our studio here says Panera and Petaluma only has NFC on half the
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.620]   registers and it's never the half that are open.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.620]   That's sickening.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.620]   Is that true or nothing?
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.620]   I think I understand.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:19.940]   It's happens in Cambridge too.
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.420]   It's so annoying.
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:22.420]   So annoying.
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.420]   It's not acceptable people.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.300]   You have to raise the bar of your NFC deployment.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:29.860]   My suspicion is that it's that there is this little hump to get over it, which I have not
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:33.300]   gotten over and that once the dam breaks you just do it all the time.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.420]   Like it's like, Oh, I can't wait.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.740]   I'm going to look for it.
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:39.540]   But I just there is some reluctance in me maybe because it's a new way of paying and
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.420]   I'm very comfortable and familiar with swiping it one time credit card.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:44.420]   I think about how long.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:49.860]   Yeah, think about how long how long credit cards really took to adopt across the nation.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.860]   Yeah, it doesn't mean it's on failure.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:57.220]   I just think that there's a little little resistance to get over, but I'm sure once you
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.220]   get over this.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:59.220]   That's absolutely true.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:04.340]   Another interesting data point for me is Apple Pay has these payments have never been
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.820]   more popular now that Apple Pay is out.
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:10.180]   Apple Pay has been out for almost half a year now.
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:13.900]   And I can't tell you how many times I will use contactless payments and I'm the very
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:19.820]   first customer they've ever had on this grease soaked payment pad that has NFC happens to
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:20.820]   be on it.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.260]   Oh my God, I've never said how that happened.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:25.420]   The register just told me you paid how that happened.
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.580]   And I'm like, I use the thing that your register has been able to do for the past year.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:32.460]   That's part of the reason I don't do it is I don't want to get in a conversation about
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.700]   what do you just do.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.900]   I'm worried about the clerk not knowing what I did.
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.900]   Right.
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.900]   And I don't want to like, I just want to say, you know, you're stealing money.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:44.300]   Yeah, that's that is actually part of the resistance.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.300]   It's the opposite.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:48.740]   It's like it's kind of like how like it was hard when I had the iPad like the first month
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:52.700]   that was released to like, I almost don't want to use it in public because I actually
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:53.700]   have work to do.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.780]   I don't want to demonstrate the iPad to people.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.260]   And like, I'll be in I'll be in line of this place.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.260]   So how did you do that?
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.260]   Oh, I use phone.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:01.260]   Oh my God.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.260]   Well, my phone do that.
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.260]   What kind of phone do you have?
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.260]   Yeah, I'll call you.
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:05.260]   I'll call you.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:06.260]   I'll do it.
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:07.260]   It'll do it.
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:18.660]   Um, Pwn to own, which is an annual Vancouver based event at Cansack West, the security conference.
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:21.620]   Every year, it happened last week.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:27.540]   Every year, what they do is they set out computers with the latest browsers, the latest
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:30.500]   operating system patches and so forth.
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:36.860]   And teams of white hat hackers, I think they're white hats, are given the opportunity to hack
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:37.860]   them.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:43.980]   If they do, they get a cash prize and they get to keep the laptop on March 19th, the second
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:50.300]   day of the Pwned Own conference, a significant, I now this, I'm looking at one article that
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:58.460]   says 240, I think it was $255,000 in prizes were awarded because Safari was hacked, Firefox
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:02.060]   was hacked, Microsoft's Internet Explorer was hacked, Chrome was hacked Adobe Flash was
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:04.300]   hacked, Adobe Reader was hacked.
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:11.700]   One guy wasn't even on a team got the largest, uh, the lion's share of this, uh, at Pwned
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:12.700]   Own.
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.140]   They're bounty hat hackers.
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:16.380]   Yeah, what, yeah, what do you call them?
[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:20.140]   Because in one way, some ways I don't like this because what happens is these guys are
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:26.380]   looking all year for exploits and when they find them, they keep them to themselves.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:31.740]   And then, um, they, because they want to make some money.
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:41.380]   So this guy, South Korean hacker, Jung Hoon Lee made him, by himself, I think $255,000
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:45.540]   he hacked, he hacked IE, Chrome and Safari.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:46.540]   Mm.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:49.140]   He's got a couple of laptops.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:52.580]   Um, for years work.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:56.540]   But I feel now once it's over, they do, they are required to reveal the exploits.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.940]   Uh, so they didn't, they'll be patched and won't work next year.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:07.660]   Uh, he took out IE 11 stable and beta versions of Google Chrome and Apple Safari got $225,000
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.900]   in prize money.
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.900]   That's so bad.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:14.900]   A total of a half a million dollars, I think was handed out.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:19.700]   Um, so, and just for those of you, a Mac users who say, well, we're safe.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:22.660]   Safari absolutely was hacked.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:26.380]   He found there were two bugs in Apple Safari that were, that they were able to use.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:28.900]   And when, by the way, it's not just like they find a bug.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:34.420]   It's like they can use the bug to take over the machine.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:35.420]   Left said.
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:36.420]   Mm.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:37.420]   Security.
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:38.420]   Perfect.
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.420]   If it didn't have to let humans in.
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:43.020]   I do have to say that Lee did say Google Chrome was the hardest to hack.
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:47.940]   It, his, Chrome exploit took over 2000 lines of code.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:48.940]   Wow.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:56.020]   And he got it to Safari using a UAF vulnerability in an uninitialized stack pointer.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.860]   So there.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:03.340]   And then he jumped out of the sandbox to execute a program in OS 10 program was non malicious,
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:04.860]   but of course it could have been.
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:05.860]   All right.
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:06.860]   Let's take a break.
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:07.860]   Come back.
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:08.860]   Your picks.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:09.860]   Sorry.
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.860]   Remember that Apple bought Beats.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:15.780]   I think you probably do remember that HP continued to make beats computers beats based
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.180]   audio computers because they had a deal that deal is ended.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:25.420]   Beats has now exited the HP arena and HP is going to team with BNO bang and old.
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:27.500]   They declined to renew the deal.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.500]   Apple did.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:29.500]   I don't know.
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500]   I'm just saying someone declined to do.
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:32.500]   Somebody do.
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.180]   Really a surprise.
[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:43.420]   The BNO play label will be on pavilion PCs, the Spectre, Omen, and V. You know, I've never
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:44.940]   noticed it makes any difference at all.
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:49.740]   It seems to me just like a label.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.860]   But there you go.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:52.860]   Let us take a break.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:55.580]   Come back with your picks of the week, lady and gentlemen.
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:00.940]   But first of all, from legal zoom.com, not a lot for better in a way.

[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:47.420]   I don't know any attorney that will even answer the phone for $50.
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.900]   Andy and not co you're pick of the week, my friend.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:53.300]   I pick of the week are a couple of really cheap and very good cases, both of them made
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.780]   by in a tech.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:58.060]   Another one of those names that they tend to slap on to that 10.
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:47:59.540]   So land on a variety of different things.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:06.660]   We recommended a recommended a S S D drive case a while back.
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:10.900]   I like as I said last week, I bought a new iPad mini.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:13.500]   I don't like like flip cases or keyboard cases.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.020]   What I like are sleeves.
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:18.540]   And so I bought this one chiefly because it looked I like things that are inexpensive
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:19.740]   and cool and clever.
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:20.980]   And this is all three.
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:22.860]   So this is a technically it's a sleeve case.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.580]   Felt so it's nice and warm and cuddly would have been put on your hands to provide frost
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.500]   bite during the winter that we had.
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:33.300]   But when you need to use your thing, it you pull it out like this, but it has this really
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:37.860]   cool clever little thing where you can just flatten this end of it.
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:40.580]   Put in there's a magnet that holds the end of the strap like that.
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:45.660]   And then you get a very, very simple little stand that you can use for reading or doing
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:46.660]   whatever.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:52.380]   It's such an easy thing for them to have to add to this very, very simple sleeve.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:56.020]   And yet it just makes it perfect for you know, I'm having a burrito and I just want this
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:57.020]   tilt to read.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:00.620]   And it also keeps it useful for the things I use tablets for.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:06.060]   I don't like those flip over cases or those hard cases because I often wind up putting
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:09.900]   these things into keyboard docs like what little portable keyboards have a little stand.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:15.860]   And sometimes that that thick case will prevent it from going through the slot.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:18.380]   That one's just 12 bucks on Amazon.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:20.860]   This other one, which I bought only because was next door to it.
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:27.140]   I've been sort of looking for a simple protective padded sleeve for my 13 inch MacBook.
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.220]   Also made of warm, warm felt.
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:32.580]   If you leave this out, your kitty is probably going to climb inside it because it's just
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.780]   no warm inside there.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:38.100]   But it is a $16 sleeve.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.740]   Couldn't be simpler, but it's slim.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.180]   It doesn't add extra bulk to the thing.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:49.140]   And meanwhile, for for cheap $17 sleeve, it is nonetheless fully lined.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:53.780]   And the lining allows it to do cool things like, well, what if we were to put in an extra
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:59.020]   little pack right here so that people can still put their mini tablets inside there and
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:03.140]   we'll put little tabs back here so people can carry their phones someplace.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:06.140]   And it's not here with me to show up.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:13.300]   But it also comes with a identically nicely tailored little elastic bag that you can see
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:15.700]   in that picture there, you can put your charger in.
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:19.120]   It was such a nice little bag that I went to New York and I needed went to the opera
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.500]   and I needed to take my little binoculars.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.020]   So I just use that as a mini binoculars case.
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:27.300]   So you get a lot of value for $16, very, very, excuse me, for $16.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:31.260]   Very, very happy with both of them so much so that I probably won't be looking for other
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.300]   ones for either one of these.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.300]   Nice.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.900]   In a tech, you must have a pipeline to the in a tech factory.
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.700]   It's kind of fun when you find yourself shopping and you say, oh, wow, that looks like exactly
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:42.700]   what I want.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:45.260]   And you realize, oh, that's from the same company from which I've bought three or four
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:46.260]   different things.
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.680]   They're probably doing things that are very much aligned with my own personal interests.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:50.680]   It's kind of generic name.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:54.640]   And the only reason I remember it is because it's so close to the name of the company in
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.640]   office space, which was in no tech.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.160]   That's the only reason I remember it.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.640]   I don't know about that.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:03.640]   It's quality products at low prices.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.560]   And we're going to take what was involved.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.560]   Nope.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.040]   You're going to be calling real.
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:13.600]   Hey, you're Nick.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.840]   My pick of the week is carrot weather.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:16.840]   What?
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.740]   I have Federico Vitticci to blame entirely for that.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:20.740]   Carrot weather.
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.780]   Have you been growing carrots?
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.660]   Yes, I am.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:29.380]   I have not been growing carrots, but I have been growing snarky AI.
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.740]   Oh, what carrot weather is like it.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:36.940]   It's a weather app that talks to you like you're like you're a little bit of a jerk.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.860]   Let's see.
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.740]   And it has special it has special forecasts too.
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:48.120]   So not only forecasts your own weather, but also has secret locations like the Lars homestead
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.620]   on Tatooine that says, "May the force be with you unless you like the prequels.
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:54.140]   Then you can go jump off a bridge."
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:52:05.060]   It's basically a snarky little UI or AI that talks to you while it's giving away information
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:06.060]   about the weather.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:12.340]   And it has the same kind of like live real time forecasts that dark sky offers, which
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:17.540]   I tried it out based on the Tichi's glowing review.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.260]   And I'm like, "You know what?
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:20.780]   This is actually really fun."
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:25.180]   And now it's like it's temporarily replaced dark sky in my first home screen.
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.300]   I don't know if it'll stay there, but for now I'm really enjoying it.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.260]   Yes, see I have dark sky.
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:33.620]   So why are these better than the Apple weather app?
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:40.580]   Well, for one thing, dark sky in specific, I like better because you get real time feedback
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:45.140]   on whether or not it's about terrain or how heavy the rain currently is rather than just
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.740]   an overview of your barometric pressure.
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:49.980]   Mine says, "Next hour, no precipitation."
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:54.980]   And the nearest precipitation is 13 miles to the north, that kind of thing.
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.780]   So I think that kind of stuff is really interesting and very helpful.
[01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:03.460]   And I like being able to see temperature changes and a seven day forecast.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.420]   Apple's weather app is perfectly perfunctory.
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:07.180]   It's just kind of boring.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.420]   The carrot, you say carrot weather is similar to this, but snarky.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:17.420]   I like an app that's willing to talk back to me a little bit.
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:18.420]   I like you.
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:22.820]   I might temporarily put dark sky in a folder somewhere and try carrot app.
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:23.820]   Thank you.
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:29.300]   Steve Jobs, you enjoy having people in your organization that are willing to challenge
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.300]   you.
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.300]   Yes.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:33.020]   All right, if you say so.
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.020]   I'll try it.
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:37.100]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.100]   The eyes want a second.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:39.100]   Serenity's pick first.
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:42.380]   I mean, Brian Mueller, who does all the carrot apps and is like carrot to do and carrot fit
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:43.380]   and carrot hunger.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:46.140]   They're all snarky and wonderful.
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:49.340]   So you might not want to use them every day, but every once in a while you just need that
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.860]   hit, that reality check to bring you back.
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:53.420]   So here's the carrot to do talking task list.
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:54.900]   That's $2.99.
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:56.620]   Carrot tough love pack.
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:58.980]   $7.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:00.660]   You can add even more snark.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:03.860]   There's carrot care, whether that's $3.
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:04.860]   Carrot alarm.
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:05.860]   People abuse you.
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:10.460]   See, this is why I need the seven minute workout, but with some snark.
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:13.460]   I like it.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.460]   It's just refreshing.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:16.260]   I mean, a lot of stuff is bland or like Serenity said, perfunctory.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:21.300]   And he's got some attitude and carrot that kind of hunger, a talking calorie counter.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:22.300]   And that was free.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:26.140]   If you want to get an idea of what you want to sample your carrot, what carrot can do
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:27.140]   for you.
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.140]   My main thing.
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:30.860]   I like the one that is showing me right now.
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:31.860]   What's it say?
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.460]   Oh, now is the winter of our disco tent.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.460]   Okay, I'm down.
[01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:39.380]   Right there on that.
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:41.180]   What do I get in the tough love bundle?
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.260]   What is Oh, I see that's the three of them together.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:45.260]   Oh, I should probably do that.
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.260]   Oh, doesn't include weather.
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:48.260]   Aren't it?
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:52.060]   You're a dirty little piggy dirty little piggy should be outside.
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:54.260]   So the rain will wash them out dirty little piggy.
[01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:56.380]   Yes, I'm a dirty little piggy.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:57.380]   I am.
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:58.380]   I am.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.220]   I'm going to purchase five more dollars right now.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:05.420]   My actual pick of the week is something I sadly can't talk very much about because
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.020]   it's embargoed until tomorrow morning.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.020]   No, you stole this.
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.940]   I knew you were going to do this.
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:12.820]   We argued about it last week and I figured if I put it in there really quickly, I'd get
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:13.820]   away with it.
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.820]   Damn you.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.940]   So again, I can't tell you anything about it except that I've been using it through
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:20.940]   the beta period and I liked it a lot.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:21.940]   Fantastic.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:22.940]   Al too is what I'm talking about.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:23.940]   Fantastic.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:28.380]   Al one has been my go to calendar on iOS and Mac since it came out.
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:29.380]   Fantastic.
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:33.140]   Al too is a re imagining of what it means to be fantastic.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:38.060]   Similar to what Fantastic Al too was on iOS just in the context of the Mac.
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.060]   It comes out tomorrow.
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.380]   It's by flexibits and it's really good.
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:47.740]   So sometime tomorrow it'll magically appear on the app store and a bunch of news outlets
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.820]   will write about it and tell you all about it.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:55.260]   But I'll just say that if you care at all about getting stuff into a calendar fast and
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:58.420]   getting it out of a calendar fast, you're going to really want to check out Fantastic
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.420]   Al.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:01.740]   It's a great team and it's a great app.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.740]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:04.740]   I know.
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:06.300]   I'm trying to be really careful here, Leo.
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:11.620]   Well I was kind of mad because we got to talk to Simmons because he's going to make
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:12.620]   a Tuesday, right?
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:13.620]   Tuesday would be better.
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.620]   Just saying.
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:15.620]   I know.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:16.620]   You do a Wednesday.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:19.420]   We're probably not going to mention it the following Tuesday.
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.420]   Just saying.
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.820]   All you have to ask is a risky thing.
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.820]   I get curious.
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:26.540]   Well the thing is for the app store, Thursday is a sweet slot because that's when Apple
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:27.540]   does their features.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:30.780]   So if they ask you to go on a Thursday, you're going to want to do that.
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:33.980]   But I kind of think that otherwise you, if you can't get Apple, you should definitely
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:36.580]   target Microsoft.
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:37.580]   Good to know.
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:38.580]   I got two picks.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.900]   I'll do them quick because they're not that interesting.
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:50.100]   The first one is from Instagram has a new app, a framing app and I can't, where did I put
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:51.100]   it?
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:52.100]   Oh here it is.
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:53.100]   Layout.
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.100]   Which will take all your pictures.
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:58.820]   If you have any pictures on your phone, of course I've deleted them all now and make
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:00.420]   a interesting layout.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.620]   It's actually really nice.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.660]   It's very simple to use.
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:08.180]   You just select the pictures you want and it will offer you some nice layouts.
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:13.900]   And then it will give you a chance to flip things around which is kind of cool.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:19.780]   And then it will give you a chance to save it and post it on Instagram of course because
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:24.940]   it's from Instagram or Facebook or use the share button.
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:25.940]   And it's free.
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.900]   What's cool about this is, I hope Instagram does more stuff.
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.620]   They did hyperlapse as well.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.620]   And they're good developers.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:32.140]   It's iOS only but they're good developers.
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.140]   I would like to see more stuff.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:34.140]   This is very simple.
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:36.500]   Lots of people already have frame apps.
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.540]   You don't need another one probably.
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:40.580]   But I thought I'd mention it.
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:45.620]   The other one, I know you guys, I know at least you, Renee or a Sosunos fan.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:49.500]   And we were having the heck of a time in the house because it's the Sonos.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:53.100]   We have several systems spread out quite a bit.
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:58:00.460]   And the system the farthest away from the Sonos bridge would constantly die.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:05.260]   And what Sonos does, which is bad, this really got bad when they added this new ability to
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:08.900]   not have a bridge but to do it all via Wi-Fi.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:12.540]   Sonos has its own kind of mesh style network that really works.
[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:16.020]   The advantage Sonos has over any other solution is everything's in sync.
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:17.020]   I don't know how it does it.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:20.540]   So if you turn on all the speakers into party mode, everything sounds the same.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:24.300]   You don't get weird delays and echoes throughout the house.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.140]   It's fabulous.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:27.980]   Lots of other good reasons to like Sonos.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:30.820]   They came out with a solution that has fixed my problem.
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:36.340]   And I wanted to tell people who, if you're having trouble with Sonos speakers losing track
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:42.700]   of where they belong or suddenly becoming Wi-Fi, and the symptom of that is you suddenly
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:47.380]   you don't have a system or part of the system disappears, this is a great solution.
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:48.780]   And Sonos should have done this ages ago.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:53.100]   This is basically a Wi-Fi access spot called the Sonos Boost.
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:54.100]   It's not very expensive.
[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:55.700]   I think it's 100 bucks.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:57.940]   And what it does is it has three antennas.
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:02.020]   It's like a massive Wi-Fi adapter.
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.740]   You plug this into your router via ethernet.
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:07.020]   Everything else can be unplugged.
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:08.900]   That's how Sonos generally works.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:10.500]   And this really solved our problem.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:15.140]   So if you've had problems with Sonos or it's because you have it's spread out or there's
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:19.380]   the internet getting in the way, which is another problem because we have a lot of Wi-Fi
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:22.500]   going around, the boost is well worth it.
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:23.500]   Fixed our problem.
[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:27.580]   Now we had the similar problems here in the studio and it did not solve our problem here.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:31.500]   But I think we have a different issue with interference.
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:36.260]   If your issue is that your stuff is spread out a lot, the boost really fixed it.
[01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:39.660]   And I put it basically in the same location that the Sonos Connect was.
[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:46.180]   So it's demonstrably better at creating the network than the Sonos Connect is.
[01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:50.540]   We're out of time, but we are not out of wonderful people.
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:53.980]   I want to thank serenity Caldwell for iMoor.com for being here.
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:55.900]   Always a pleasure.
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:56.900]   Is this melting?
[01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:57.900]   Is it melting?
[01:59:57.900 --> 01:59:59.900]   Is spring coming?
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:05.380]   Supposedly it's going to be in the 50s next week, this week.
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.380]   Fingers crossed.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.380]   I'm hoping for you.
[02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:08.380]   Maybe.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:10.180]   I'll believe in spring.
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.260]   You know you can always come out here.
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:13.260]   I know.
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.260]   80 degrees this weekend.
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:16.260]   It's actually beautiful today.
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:18.300]   It's a gorgeous day, isn't it?
[02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:21.260]   If only you're not slowly sinking into drought.
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:22.260]   Oh, that.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:23.540]   Oh, there won't be any water.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:25.380]   No, you don't need water.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:26.380]   I like my showers.
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:27.380]   No, no, no.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:29.300]   You don't want to come here then.
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:33.620]   This is the place where you shower with a friend to save water.
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:37.300]   We there are lots of other bumper stickers, but I won't continue.
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.860]   Mr. Rene, Richie, iMoor.com.
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.860]   Nice to have you.
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:43.660]   Montreal, is it patio weather?
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:47.300]   So Leo, it went up to one degree Celsius and opened my window just because I wanted
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:48.300]   some fresh air.
[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:52.420]   I fell asleep and then I woke up and it was minus 25 with wind chill.
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:55.380]   My iPhone felt like it had liquid nitrogen poured on it.
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:59.380]   There was frozen condensation on my table and I'm not leaving my house again till June.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:00.380]   I saw your post.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:01.380]   That's why I brought it up.
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:03.140]   I felt so bad for you.
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:04.140]   Geez, Louise.
[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:06.540]   It's great to have you, Rene.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.540]   Always.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.540]   Rene does a great podcast.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:10.500]   Actually, Serenity also does great podcasts.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.500]   It's the incomparable.

[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:28.380]   Nobody types net or comment anymore.

[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:42.300]   Best sideburns in technology.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:45.140]   Thank you for being here.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.140]   Best of technology.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:50.500]   I'd have to argue with that sideburns and technology now that Asimov is very much not
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:52.580]   with us anymore.
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:55.460]   I could be talked out of that, but that's not ridiculous.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:59.500]   You know who gave you a run for your money recently?
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:04.140]   In Phoenix, the last movie he did, what was it called?
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:05.820]   It's the one based on the pension novel.
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:06.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:11.540]   He plays a 1970s detective.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:12.540]   Stoner detective.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:14.020]   He was rocking it.
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:19.060]   Actually, now the thing about Bert Ritan has nice sideburns and also as the CEO of skilled
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:25.380]   composite size, probably have to say that the makers of low altitudes spacecraft, I
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:28.180]   have to say, probably more tech savvy than I.
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.180]   I would.
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:30.380]   Nobody's more tech savvy than you.
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:38.380]   The movie was inherent vice and he plays a character named Larry Doc Sportello and has
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:42.340]   sideburns much like yours.
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:46.900]   I don't want to brag, but you know, if your phone, iPhone is having problems, I think
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:48.980]   I could probably fix it before he can.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:51.100]   Hey, thanks for being here, you guys.
