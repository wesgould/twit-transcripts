[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.200]   I'll give you a hint.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200]   It looks a little like this.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200]   Next, a Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.200]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   From people you trust.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.400]   This is Twit.

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 591, recorded Tuesday, January 2nd, 2018.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600]   Mac in Black.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600]   First show of 2018.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   And boy, there's news from Apple.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.600]   Well, we were on vacation.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600]   A lot of stuff happened.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   Renee Ritchie is here from Montreal his last day in his old apartment.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   I'm more.com.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   Hello, Renee.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600]   I didn't get a vacation.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   I was on this island.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   I was by myself and they hunted me down and they extended an iPhone towards me that had issues.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   And I just had to decide in that moment if I was going to pick it up and resume my life.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600]   Did that make you crazy?
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600]   Like you had to cover the battery story and the whole...
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600]   I learned a lot.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   I always learned a lot.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   I know.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   I'm counting on you to explain it all for us.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   So we're glad we're...
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   No pressure.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   I'm curious.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   800 years iPhones have I used Leo.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   My own explanation.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   Also with Alex Lindsey from the Bexelkorren Studio.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   Do you have a happy holiday?
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   I did have a happy holiday.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   You did not have to write up 100,000 words on Apple battery problems.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   You know, I did not.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   I did not have to write about it.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   I barely even paid attention.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   Me too.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   That's why we're glad Renee is here.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   Explain it all for us.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   Andy Inako is also here from the Chicago Sun Times in the coldest place in the world.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Oh, good heavens, yes.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Do people from Montreal laugh when people in Boston say, "Oh, it's...
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Everyone's pain is legitimate, Leo.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Your pain is legitimate."
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   Such a point of the correct thing to say.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   I was in the Caribbean and it was up for a little bit of reason.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   It rained for like five minutes and I was so upset.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   Andy, Andy, you're getting the coldest winter in New England in years.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   It's definitely the longest...
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   It's the sort of day where the daily newspaper always has.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   Here's what the record was.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Here's what it might be today.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   So, yeah.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Normally, it's not as bad as we're all being reminded of two years ago where we got this
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   like a month of snow and then two or three weeks of like sub-freezing temperature.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   None of the snow was melting or going anywhere.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   So, the snow was piles just getting higher and higher and higher and we're just tunneling
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   through things.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Well, something happened while I was gone.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   I was kind of surprised.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   A guy in a white beard in a red suit dropped something off while I was gone.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   In fact, let me show you because maybe you can tell me...
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   Something happened.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   It was fairly fit under the Christmas tree.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   You're out to turn my microphone.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   So, you can hear me shouting...
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   I like to just shove that surface off his desk.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Just shove that surface right off his desk.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   I think I'm in some room.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   This thing is huge!
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   What is this?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   I flake my name rich.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Talk about generating heat.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   By the way, I love the wedge shaped box.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   That's the first giveaway, isn't it?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Yep.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   It's a tonton.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   So, I guess we should open this.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   I think so.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   Have you bought one yet?
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   Alex?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   I have not.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   I'm waiting to see how yours works.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   Renee, you got one, right?
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   So, I was so close to buying one in the store, but the ones in the store do not come with
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   the track pads, and I don't cut into apple mouses, so I delayed my purchase.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   Well, I blame you for this, Renee.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   You talked me into it on our last break weekly.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   I'll take it.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   Look, it's gorgeous.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   It's space gray.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   That's all you need to know.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   It's gray.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   It's gray.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   It's the iMac Pro for those of you listening at home.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   It came on December...
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   It was supposed to come to December 28th.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   It came the day after Christmas.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   Oh.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   The 26th.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   Boxing day.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   It came a little sooner.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   It was really unboxing day.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   So, this is you.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   I wasn't here.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   I was in the Caribbean.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   I got a notice to my phone.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   Your iMac Pro has arrived in joy, and I went, "Oh."
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   And none of the heavy-fingered Twit folks opened it for you?
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   Well, you know what?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   I...
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   This took...
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   I've been home for three days, and it took great fortitude, not.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   It came out from Russian to the office, and opened the...
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Because you...
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   ...and opened the keyboard.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   And, of course, the box is too pretty to put shipping labels on it, so they have to ship it inside another custom-made box.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   Just to protect the box art, yes.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   Well, if the box came damaged, people would sue Andy.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   Oh, look!
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   Don't...
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   Oh, look at that.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   It's a major award.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   Okay, so the front just kind of...
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   ...lies down.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   There's the steel gray.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   The keyboard's steel gray, too.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   It's pretty.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   Yeah, everything's steel gray, right?
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   Even the...
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   Even the modern...
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   ...the screen cover is steel gray.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   Yeah, it must have a mouse in there, too.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   Look at that, and it's got the full keyboard.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   It's almost a black keyboard.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   It's a beautiful keyboard.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   This makes sure that you can properly look down on all your friends, because you have...
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   Yes.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   ...pro...
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   ...versa...
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   ...remember, there must be any color or any joy expressed in the product.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   So, René convinced me to...
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   ...nothing but the...
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   ...to...
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   ...guilty...
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   ...serve...
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   ...sweet spot is the 10...
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   Sorry, not sorry, Leo.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   10 core, 64 gig RAM, right?
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   That has the highest frequency.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   That is...
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   ...you still have to charge it on the bottom.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   But...
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   It is a beautiful mouse, a black mouse.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   And you know, even what's nice, even the paper that they...
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   ...cover the screen in.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   ...came it.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   And the stickers.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   You see the sticker is Leo.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   There's stickers?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   Look at this.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   Oh, it comes with a charging cable, a black lightning...
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   ...by the way, you could always get lightning charging cables in black from other companies.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   This is the first time Apple's ever made a black lightning...
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   ...day Apple invents black.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   And here comes the stickers, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   Now, I got black stickers with my Mac trash can.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   Are there stickers?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   Oh, Alex, the best part in here.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   This is what you paid to and grandpa.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   Oh, there was no stickers at all.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   I don't know what happened to them.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Oh, but I already have black stickers.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   Yeah, but now you got black stickers.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   You can have this.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   That's four more than the rest of us.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   I now have four black stickers.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   All right.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   Let's take this off.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   Alex, just push that surface.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Make some space for it.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   Whoo!
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   Purdy.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   Sorry to block you, Renee, but the thing is so damn big.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.600]   It's so much better looking than I am.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   You know, what would have been really cool is if this little cleaning thing was Vanta.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   Vanta black.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   Oh.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   That would have been...
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   Oh, it is.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   I don't know what he's talking about.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   Of course, it would have been a Star Wars.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   No, no, it's like the pure, that super black, uh, black that is, that absence of all light.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   Of course, it would have cost this thing.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   The most, the most...
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   The most, the most, the most, the most, the most...
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   It would have cost this thing.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   My birth computer.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   It would have been worth it.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   We're removing the screen protection.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   That means we own it now, right?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   Yep.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Especially when you rip it in the middle.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   Oh, we ripped it in the middle.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   How am I going to put that back in the box?
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Just be careful when you put it in your pocket with that screen protector.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   So, the funny thing is, aside from the...
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   Oh, you're not going to notice anything different about this, right?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   I mean, it's exactly to the millimeter, the same casing as the current iMac.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   Oh, but it looks so cool!
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   The fan vent, the fan vent on the back, Leo, that's the giveaway.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   Um...
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   But I have to say, it's, you know, and this, this was the way it was with the first...
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   iMac.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   It's nice.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   You do not have a lot of wires.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   You know, you just...
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   Can Karsten just put me in that iMac for the show?
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   You just...
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   One wire coming at the back.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   Of course, there's another wire to charge your...
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   Let me show you the backside.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   It's pretty, too.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   Oh, they even put a sticker on the apple.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   You don't want to scratch the apple?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   Oh, that's a shiny apple.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   $8,000 as configured.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   Ooh!
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   Um, that's, again, the 10 core.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   I can't remember how big a hard drive, but you all told me not to get a giant hard drive.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   Yes.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   Because...
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   I mean, I...
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   It's one.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.360]   That was the only choice, I guess.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.600]   The fiber cloth that comes with it is quite nice.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   [laughs]
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   Ooh!
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   It's kind of so cool.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   Lindsay approved.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   Lindsay approved five or 12 fiber cloths.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   And I just tested it on my glasses.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   It worked quite well.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   Where did the keyboard...
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Oh, the keyboard said...
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   All of this is wireless, isn't it?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   So I don't need anything.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   You use the lightning cable to pair it, but then after that it's wireless.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   Oh, you do use the lightning cable.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   That's why they put a lightning cable on the wall.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   It charges it and it pairs...
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   It does that instant pairing thing?
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   To start it up, I should put the lightning cable in the keyboard.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   I think, yeah.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:06.000]   So I see one, two, three, four type A USB ports and one, two, three, four type C USB ports.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That's nice.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.600]   Multiple ports on a Pro machine.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   Wow.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.000]   Ten gigabit ethernet, right?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's nice.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.600]   And an SD card reading slot.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   Yeah!
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   What the what?
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   SD card.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   SD cards were...
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   No, that's quite nice.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   They're not in position or they'll take it away.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   Just be very careful.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   I'm gonna forget that I have that.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.240]   Well, because yeah, I think because maybe you don't want to spin the screen around every
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   time you want to turn there.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   I know, that's good.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   So, yeah.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   Well, you get your fumble, you feel it.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   I have a little reader that stuck to my foot.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   I'll take the way.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   All right, the on/off switch is as always in my manner.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   It's not just a close off.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.600]   I thought Phil said because Pro photographer is some use compact flash cards because they
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.120]   can't make everybody happy, they decided the smartest thing to do is to take a WSD card.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   Not to make everybody miserable.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.640]   If you can't make everybody, but now my camera, all but my 5D and 5D even has an SD card.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.560]   All but my 5 or even our Blackmagic video cameras are SD cards.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.960]   Yeah, and my Sony A9 is SD.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   So that's fine.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   I think it's great.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.520]   Your Olympus is an SD card.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   And this is 10 gig internet?
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   10 gig.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.320]   My audio, everything is SD.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.120]   Yeah, so I don't mind an SD reader.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.920]   I don't want to say that Phil was saying something silly because he's the head of marketing.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   I think the people just get real.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   I think the people just get really good.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.840]   My liking uses an SD card.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.600]   We don't have enough room for everybody.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   Go ahead, John.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.440]   You do the on/off switch there.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.320]   All right, we're going to boot up.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.600]   Does it make a special bong?
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.600]   Does it make anything?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.000]   Oh, you can make a special bong or anything.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.160]   You're Northern California, man.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   That's right.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   It's legal today as of yesterday in recreational marijuana.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   This tea has gotten a lot better.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.160]   I can tell you that for now than mine.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   Like Renee.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.480]   Renee's peeking over the top.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   Kill Ray was here.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.680]   All right, well, it's dead on arrival.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.680]   Thank you very much, everybody.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.680]   That's the iMac Pro.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   Bong, bong, bong.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   Oh, there it goes.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.520]   I just had to think for a little long.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   There it was thinking.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.280]   Oh, there's a lot of ram.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.400]   Is that a big long ram test?
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.440]   Is that what I can expect from now on Renee?
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.800]   Well, I mean, do you do you really boot them a lot, Leo?
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   Never.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.440]   People have been saying, oh, good.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.800]   Can I have the Surface Studio?
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.080]   I'm not giving up the Surface Studio.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.880]   If this iMac was a touchscreen in LaFlam, I would.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.240]   But it doesn't do either of those things.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.440]   Why don't you make turn the Surface Studio into a giant Wacom tablet for your iMac?
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   You can not do that.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.680]   No, this thing is-- I think I'm going to take this home.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.320]   I don't think I'm even going to leave it here.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.160]   And there's really no reason for this to exist.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   Not my life, anyway.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   But I'm--
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   It's going to be your home media server.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.440]   It needs to connect to the--
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.720]   The mouse-- it wants the mouse first.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   The mouse.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   That hell?
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   OK.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   That is--
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   That is the--
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   That is the--
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   That is the--
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   Oh, that is the--
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Oh, that is the--
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   Oh, that is extremely cryptic.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   The mouse is off.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   It's off?
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   Is it off?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   Turn it on?
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   OK.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720]   It should have enough juice, right?
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   So the keyboard's connected.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   And now the mouse is on.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   There we go.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   Now it's working.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   Next.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   I won't be using either this keyboard--
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   Thank you.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.120]   --or the mouse for any length of time.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.040]   I was going to say, I think the magic mouse that comes with this new iMac--
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   It's going to be the one--
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.040]   It's gorgeous.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.680]   --the mouse in anybody's drawer ever.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   Yes.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.120]   What does that say?
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   I can't read it.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.280]   Bluetooth-- to pair the Bluetooth keyboard, turn it on and wait for your computer to
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   connect to it.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   Well, it's not on.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   It's on.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   Dummy.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   Dummy.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   I can never turn my off.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   I always just leave it on.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   Well, it goes to sleep.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.080]   Well, there's a little slot on the keyboard at the top.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.080]   Is there a--
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   No, no, up on the-- up on the--
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   The front part?
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   Is that a slot?
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080]   It looks like a--
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.000]   Well, something.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   What do you think that is?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   It's got rubber in it.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Don't know.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Mine has that, too.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.280]   I don't know what that's for you there.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280]   Sesthetics.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   Oh.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   [SIGHS]
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.720]   OK, now sees the keyboard.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.120]   You have that, too.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   That's the-- you have the little--
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.640]   That's how the regular-- like the mortal, the silver version that us mortals have.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.720]   Didn't you already ask what language?
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   All right.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.160]   That's the last one.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.600]   Oh, it's--
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   It's thinking.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   [GASPS]
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.640]   But I'm a trackpad user like all good-hearted people.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   All right.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   I don't know if I'll go through this whole setup.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   It's A, it's too bright.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.520]   Can you iris down a little bit so that we can see it?
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.960]   And B, it looks just like setting up any other Mac.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.680]   It's just dark, right?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.520]   It should show you all the cores firing at once so people know you're setting the--
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   Oh, I'd love to see that.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.080]   I'd love to see that.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.400]   You could use-- there is software, you know, multi-monitor or whatever.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   I step monitor.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   I step monitor.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   Yeah, I step.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.560]   Mark, I feel-- I feel completely blind if I don't have I-step running.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.560]   Really?
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.560]   Yeah, like I have it on every computer.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.560]   Like, if it's one of a--
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.560]   Just to know if it's--
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   I've seen how much you're bandwidth--
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   It's
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   code-ing and, you know.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   All right.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   But it tells me, like, am I rendering or something?
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   I can look over and just--
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.920]   You have a license for that somewhere lying around.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.120]   I've got a license for six of them.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.080]   Like the family pack.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:04.560]   It's good to have like an external bank of lights like in an old ENIAC.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:12.360]   There's some madman created a fully functional 6502 CPU using like full-size
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   transistors.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.280]   It's about like a meter on a side.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.380]   And one of the coolest things about it is that you decide what the hell-- let's put
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.640]   like an LED at every single register.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.520]   So when it's running, it's just a flurry of lights.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.680]   As you see, numbers actually moving through this CPU.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.920]   And I don't think I'd like to have a computer about the size of a parking space, but I think
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   I would like to have a computer with more lights.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.440]   This is the one that I probably shouldn't go through, but this is the one where I always
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:44.160]   get mad because I have-- I use a different Apple ID for iTunes and for my iCloud.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.160]   You can do that?
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.480]   Right here at the bottom in the fine print, use different IDs for both of them.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   I don't know.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   I can't remember why I do that, but there's a good reason, right Renee?
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   No.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.960]   Well, you don't want anyone should be surfing your iCloud ID when you're typing it into
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   log in.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.480]   In the office, it's not a big deal, but when you have your laptop out with you at coffee
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:08.400]   shops and stuff, you could have someone just waiting to keep it what you're typing in.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.000]   Now, why can't I just take my old iMac and put it back to back with this iMac and have
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   them transfer?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   You can cable it.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I think you can still do the--
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Can you really?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.640]   Yeah, you can put a cable in between them and do the setup assistant.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:27.160]   What I thought was crazy was we were at an event and the producer that was sitting next
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.400]   to me was trying to get on the Wi-Fi and it asked if I wanted to share the Wi-Fi password
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   for the space.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   iOS 11.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.600]   With somebody next to me.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.120]   It happened randomly and I was like, "Yes!"
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   He just boomed.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   He was on.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   Wow.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   It wasn't even between two of my own phones.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.440]   It was like with somebody else with an iPhone.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.920]   But now I can't figure out when it turns on and when it doesn't turn on.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   I've never seen it again.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.880]   It was like this magic moment of happiness and then it was going.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.200]   It'll request it.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.440]   If you have a guest network that will let you share a guest password, if you have a normal
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.080]   Wi-Fi network and someone else is trying to get on it and all your iPhones are up to
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.000]   date, they'll sort of do this Bluetooth handshake and let you pass on the password without
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   telling it to them.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.320]   You'll actually know what your password is.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.400]   You can just pull them for the note.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   That was amazing.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   It was amazing.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   So now it's...
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.840]   What do people do who don't have other Apple stuff?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.840]   When they say...
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   They turn into us.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.920]   They just try to be nice.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.720]   They say sign into iCloud and then you look at your phone and you get the digits.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.400]   What do the little people do?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.800]   If like this is their only match.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   I think they have to make it happen.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   The funny thing is that when that happens for me, I've got these iPads and iPhones.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.760]   It goes like all over the house it just goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.840]   They probably don't have a two factor Apple account if they're not already Apple.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.200]   Well, I turned on two factors.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   That's why.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.840]   You can have convenience or you can have security.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.000]   I was getting my watch to run my Apple TV.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I'm walking in.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's why I'm silent.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.440]   I got in this confusing mix of different codes.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.320]   There was a pairing for digit code and then there was the six digit code and I had to
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.880]   figure out which one had to come first and it was very complicated.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   It's very complicated.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   But now my watch.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.680]   Why is it now sending me a text message?
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   That's a separate one.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   This is exactly what I dealt with.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.960]   It should only give you a pop up that shows like the map is telling you where it's coming
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   from.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.800]   Yeah, I got that and now I have another one that's just sending a text message to my
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.920]   phone for a four digit.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.400]   I've done something wrong.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.240]   Oh, that's for the iTunes maybe that different account?
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.360]   Maybe but if that would still be on the old set, I don't know.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   We should check it.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.880]   There's a lot of things with Apple where the answer is I don't know.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.520]   It used to be yes or no.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.680]   It was like just a clear answer.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.320]   You cannot do that, sir.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   And then that you were done.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.160]   But now it's like, maybe I got to say it's still the short travel keyboard.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.240]   I'm not as but I have a real keyboard at home.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   It's not.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.760]   You can get a Logitech MX mouse.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.800]   You can get you know what I have is that DOS keyboard that Andy recommended.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.560]   Now he doesn't use them anymore with the cherry the cherry brown keys are nice.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   And the comic book characters?
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.600]   Yeah, no, I took those off.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   Andy you moved on to another keyboard.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.960]   I recommended the DOS keyboard a few years ago when I bought a new one last year.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.120]   I like the DOS, but I got a 110 keyboard.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.920]   I think I can see for some years.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.480]   You got the WASD coders keyboard, didn't you?
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.480]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.480]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.480]   I have that everywhere.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.960]   It's a little bit more compact.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.320]   And I just yeah, I just liked it.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   I have that.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.760]   I kind of want a big one that requires hammers.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   Yes.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   VR.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.560]   You can do that in AR, do that in AR kit and Alex.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.120]   So you want sort of a blue man group sort of keyboard?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   Exactly.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   That was just awesome.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   You just got a poutels.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.120]   Especially if it had a little injector to constantly have the same.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.120]   So like it's so thick, you know, almost pain going everywhere.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.120]   So I'm just letting it's now just going to it's done.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.680]   I've logged in all the logins and I guess it's just going to keep keep going.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.520]   Is there anything I could put on there that would.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   Photo scan.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   I'll give you some photos.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   Photo scan?
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   Yeah, that's that's it takes a lot of CPU power.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.920]   That's the one I told you like renders for like six days in a row.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.160]   Oh, the one you showed us so we could see go.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   No, we're not.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.400]   We did it really fast.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.320]   I probably buy one of these like next week of this.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   Any reason I shouldn't do express setup Renee?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.720]   No, I mean, unless you really fussy about everything.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.960]   That's for Siri and location and then sending material information back to Apple and all
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   that stuff.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.360]   No, I want this is, you know, that's not Microsoft for crying out loud.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.000]   We wouldn't know to do it that if you gave it to us.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   This is the part.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Okay.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.640]   This is the part everybody when you're installing your new Mac.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.240]   Don't just say, okay to this.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.480]   I hate this.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.840]   Yes, don't do that.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.040]   Store files from documents and desktop in iCloud Drive.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.160]   No, no, no, that's defaulted by default checked and that drives me nuts.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.320]   Yeah, that's not a good.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.240]   I can see saying documents.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.200]   I don't keep anything in my documents folder.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.720]   So I think that well, the cynic would say this is Apple's attempt to get you to buy more
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.960]   iCloud storage because if you store everything in your documents folder up there, you're
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   going to use it up.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.000]   I'm still regret for not having bought Dropbox when it was a feature, not a product.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.240]   And now still some of the consequences of that.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.680]   So interestingly, by default, file vault is turned on.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.760]   The check marked both those boxes, which are turn on file vault, disk encryption and
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.040]   allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.600]   That's so if you forget your password, you can still use your iCloud account.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.920]   And it's got that T2 chip.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.400]   So it's all done in hardware acceleration.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   So you shouldn't have any.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.480]   So you do do do that.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   Is that the default?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.000]   All maxed out of file vault.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I don't think so.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I don't think so.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   I think that's it.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I've never seen that interface.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.520]   Yeah, I always turn it on.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.440]   But now it's saying by default, use file vault.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   That's good.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   Oh, sorry.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   Now everybody sees my file vault recovery key.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.360]   So so much for my file vault.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.840]   Only on that machine.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   You can change it later.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   Let's do that.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   Can I change it later?
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   You should be able to thank you.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   What if I back out of it?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.240]   Let me back out of it.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.360]   Now don't look.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   Is it the same or is it going to give me a new one?
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.640]   It didn't even give me a new one at all this time.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   So now I folks at home that saw my unencryption passkey.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.280]   Could you send me an email with that?
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   That's the recovery key.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.680]   But I don't need to because I check the box.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.040]   It says recover from iCloud.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.120]   There you go.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.320]   There's the high Sierra desktop.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.880]   I have to say 5k is gorgeous.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   D3.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.400]   And is this so is this different from the current 5k I'm at?
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.680]   No, it's the same screen 10 bit.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.560]   It's got one of the 10 bit dithering on the P3 display.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.760]   So you get simulated billions of colors, which is really nice.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.920]   So let me go to about this Mac anyway.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   Just zoom back to get that whole screen.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.600]   So if you play HDR, do you get an HDR experience?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   Not really.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.200]   You get HDR-ish because the entire pipeline is HDR, but you're still limited by the LCD
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.640]   technology on to how much contrast ratio it can give you.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.000]   But it'll do 10 bit.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.640]   So this one is different because it's Skylake.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.960]   So it does 8 bit HEVC decoding, but it'll use the GPU to do those two final bits.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.440]   So it will give you full HDR pipeline.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.440]   Right.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.240]   It's just fusing them.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.280]   I'll just read this off.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.120]   Three gigahertz Intel ZONW.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.680]   Get over the hell that is.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.080]   I'm at Pro 2017.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.840]   Memory 64 gigs, 2666 megahertz DDR4 startup disk Macintosh.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.600]   HD graphics, Radeon, Pro Vega 6416.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.080]   Did I get the wrong video card?
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   I can't even know.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   You got the good one.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   I got the good one.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.880]   And then storage, one terabyte.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   There you go.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.840]   There you have it built in right into this place.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   There you go.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   There you go.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   Space gray icon.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   Oh, look.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   Yeah, it matches.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   Yep.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   Darn right it does.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   Darn right it does.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.560]   416 gig sims.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.200]   All four slots are occupied.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.600]   Yeah, they always occupy.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.120]   They said they always occupy the slots no matter what configuration because it gives
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   them better parity.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.280]   And you want to have balanced anyway, right?
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   Two and two.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.200]   I guess you could do 32 or 32.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.080]   Memory upgrade instructions.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.360]   Don't bring it to Apple.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.840]   Yep.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   That's the instruction.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   And there you go.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   Support.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.200]   And I won't go to the service because I'll show, I don't know what it'll show.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   Well, there you go.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.360]   That is a brand new iMac Pro and manage your feels fast.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   That mouse goes in.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   Wow.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   That screen is so pretty.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   It is very pretty, actually.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.320]   And having the gray kind of makes the whole computer fade away.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.040]   And as we all know from Pro apps, making a darker color means it's more expensive.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.840]   You can charge more as long as it's dark.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   All right.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.440]   Well, we'll have a full review on Saturday on the new screen savers.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.760]   That'll give me some time to benchmark it.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.680]   Is it black magic's disk test still the way to do it?
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   Well, that's just a test test.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.200]   Then what you want to do is you want to use, I mean, a lot of people have already run
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   like Cinebench on it.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   But you can run Cinebench.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   It's just for speed testing.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.600]   For processor speed.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.000]   But I could send you some photos.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.080]   And I'll do the rendering.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   Do photo scan.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   Let's do it.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.480]   Because photo scan is pretty, it uses both the GPU and the CPU.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.400]   And if you tell me how long it takes for it to do, I'll send you something simple.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   That's a great idea.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   That won't take like days.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   That's a great idea.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   Okay.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   So I'll work on that.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.400]   That'd be very helpful.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   Thank you, Alex.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   And then I'll do it on my laptop and on my iMac.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   Because I have the newest iMac as well at home.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   It's pretty decked out.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   And compare it to that.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   So we can compare that one and see like what the speeds were like.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.240]   And then of course, what I always do with the new Mac is I go to the App Store, see if
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.480]   there's any updates.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   Probably.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   Would there be?
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   Maybe.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   I don't know.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   Let's see.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.560]   And then download all the purchase steps that are.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.720]   This is one of the things that's nice about the App Store.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.960]   Doesn't that save you a lot of time?
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.920]   Every time I install something that's not on the Mac Store, I go, oh, this is going to
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   be a pain later.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.960]   I'm going to pay for this.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.360]   Well, I still plan there updating iTunes to 12.7.2.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.920]   Are you putting ethernet in there, John?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   You know, you probably should.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.960]   We have 10 gigabit ethernet.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.000]   Is there any way I can get 10 gigabit to the--
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Yes.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.080]   I'd have to go back to the server room probably.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.680]   It's got a Camron Leo right now.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.240]   He can do that.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.000]   We have 10 gigabit fiber in here.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.480]   I mean, it'd be kind of interesting.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.520]   You're just taking all the bandwidth for 20.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.160]   I'm going to install numbers, iMovie, keynote, pages.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   Final Cut, if you got it.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   Oh, gosh, man, I do.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   I do on fiber cut.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:27.480]   And then do your 360 video in VR, Leo.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.200]   So yeah, it looks nice.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   And during the show, Alex can build us VR apps.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   It looks nice.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   There you go.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   [WHISTLE]
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   [WHISTLE]
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   [WHISTLE]
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.680]   I just hate to imagine how much this new Mac is going to contribute to global warming,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.120]   just with everybody trying to find the most CPU intensive stuff they don't know.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   I'm just trying to see it.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.320]   I should use a Bitcoin mining on it just for fun.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.720]   I feel warmer already.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   You have ethernet.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.840]   You have ethernet and I have video out.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   Nice.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.840]   Thank you, John.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840]   You're very good.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   John's the best.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.400]   So should I turn off Wi-Fi and just...
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   Let's just...
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.080]   I'm just curious what happens if I go to fast.com.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   Let's just...
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.200]   This is Netflix span with test going, "Oh, oh, oh!"
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.640]   I've never seen it that fast.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.760]   That's really...
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   I did 1.3.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.440]   I've never seen it over 1.0.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.320]   Here, they are so fast.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.960]   Because of the overhead machines, we usually get 960...
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   Right.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   960...
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   Mine has been a...
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.360]   That's a good sign.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   That's a good sign.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.280]   Let's go to speed test, see what we get.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.680]   Why not?
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.880]   So we're hardwired now via our Sonic 10 gigabit fiber connection.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.760]   So that could be your connection to Sonic.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.920]   It's fast-metrocyne.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   These speed tests rarely does as well as a fast-
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   You have to connect...
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   You have to find...
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.840]   Well, it's because you have to find a server...
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.400]   That's pure dysonic, yeah.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   Right.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.600]   So uploads better than download right now.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   So that's fast.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.360]   I bet you that's fast-metrics that's having...
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.600]   That can't go any faster.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.000]   We're pegging fast-metrics, yeah.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Should I...
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   You can find another server.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.080]   Find one that's better for Sonic.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.920]   Anyway, there you go.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.920]   It's okay for these kinds of things.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   It's not right.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.720]   It's okay, you know.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:19.760]   So what I was thinking of doing, I only have a scant terabyte internal drive.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.920]   I have a modicum of storage.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   A modicum of storage.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.760]   I always think of that when we say this kind of thing.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.880]   In 1993, I bought 122-meg drive.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   I know.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   And someone asked, "What are you going to do with it?
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   What are you going to do with all that memory?"
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   And I was like, "Audio.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   I could beat you."
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   I could beat you.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   In '85 or '86, I bought a 5-megabyte drive.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.760]   Very hideously expensive.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.240]   But I needed it because I had to build my white Smith-C compiler by hand.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.840]   You had to bootstrap it up.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.640]   And I had to have all that storage for all the libraries.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640]   I know.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   All right.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:28:02.040]   Anyway, I do have a one-third party Thunderbolt 3 drive external drive enclosure I could try
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   with the Akidio.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.440]   So I could plug that into the back of it, benchmark that as external.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.680]   But the problem is it's only to Samsung Evo's, not even the Evo Pro's.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.080]   You can benchmark it and see what the internal drive is doing.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.160]   I'll tell you what, I'll download right now.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   I'll get the black magic.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.680]   We can at least see that.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.680]   All right.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   That's enough of that.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   That's enough of that.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   Enough of that.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.080]   I'm not gloating.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.000]   I didn't really want to buy it, but I had to because Renee had one.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.440]   It was my duty to God and country.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.080]   There's some breaking news, Leo.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   Yes.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.680]   Buddy Build, which is a Vancouver-based dev tools company, has just joined Apple's Xcode
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.720]   team as of like three months ago.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   Wow.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.160]   So they're probably going to integrate with TestFlight.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.280]   So BuddyBuild was a--
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   BuddyBuild.com.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.040]   It was one of those deployment solutions I understand.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.560]   Kind of like, what is it I use on Linux?
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560]   So it does--
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.560]   It happens with their Android app, but the rest of it should be trying.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   Interesting.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   Works with GitHub.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   It's a good hockey win too.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.480]   I test it when Apple, hockey went to Microsoft.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   One time.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.960]   All right.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.240]   So we try a little Blackmagic.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.320]   That old Blackmagic got me in its spell.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.800]   That old Blackmagic that I know so well.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.960]   So while we're running this test, we probably won't take that long.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.600]   What do you recommend, Alex, when we do this?
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.760]   How big a size file?
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.760]   Big or little?
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.360]   Usually, Big is going to give you the overall view.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.360]   I have gigabytes.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.600]   It tells you different things.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.200]   But 5Gigs is going to be easier to measure.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.800]   And this is from Blackmagic.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.280]   And the reason they do this is actually shown in the graph, the grid below.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.760]   It shows you what kind of video you can reasonably stream to the hard drive from.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.360]   So speed test.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.480]   I would expect it to do that.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   Whoa.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   Right.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.560]   So it basically says you can do everything.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   It pegged.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   It pegged it.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   Everything on one.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   It pegged it.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   Anything you'd like to do with this computer?
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:14.680]   The reads are a little slower, but we're getting three gigs, three gigabytes a second read,
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.280]   and two and a half gigabytes a second.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   I'm sorry, right.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.720]   One gigabyte size and a half read.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.280]   When we did the road to 1080p, when we did the original Mac break, we built raids, like
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:31.040]   really fast raids so that we could get up to, we needed 220 megs a second to make that
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   work.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.160]   And it was six really expensive drives.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   And eventually we got the excerpts and everything else just to be able to get to 200.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Which was point at the point.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.560]   There's a green checks in every box on there.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   That's amazing.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.120]   I'm probably thrashing the drives.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.520]   I'm really stop this now.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.520]   I really want one.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.520]   Let's do a screen.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520]   It's so cool.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.520]   You just want to do it.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   It is pretty cool.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.240]   Let's do a screenshot real quick.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.720]   You're like a new Mustang owner who chews up the tires like on day three.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.280]   You just got to make it do a burn.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.080]   It's got to do a couple of donuts and then I'll be done.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.240]   So that's pretty good.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   That is amazing.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   Is it?
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   Better than I've never seen that number.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   Those two numbers.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.440]   I didn't know that Donald went that high.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.200]   I love it that it pegged the right dial immediately.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.760]   I feel like it can't go.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.000]   It's like the problem is not the hard drive.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   The problem is the software can't go.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   That's the scale of the of the of the.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   It sucks.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   There's not an actual high physical hard drive.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.680]   You can go in and replace.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.800]   But it's so cool when you put those chips right on the board.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.840]   Are they using m.2 NVMe on this?
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   I don't know.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   I think they are probably.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   I believe so.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   It's also everything.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   Wow.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   I need one.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:53.280]   I think Alex is going to have to excuse himself.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.440]   You have a hard time talking.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:02.560]   So just to give you the final results, 3,035.5 megabytes per second.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   Right.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.160]   2,491.2 megabytes per second.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   Read.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   And that's typical of SSD.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.960]   Read is a little slower than write.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   No.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   Is that the other way around?
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   No.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.960]   Usually.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   Usually.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   Reach to be faster.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.960]   Why is write so fast?
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   I don't know.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   What the hell?
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   I think because it doesn't care.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   It doesn't have to go look funny.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.840]   So basically I'm going to take this home and that's what I'm going to do all day.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   Yes.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   Nothing else.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   We all come to dinner.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   I can't lease on transcoding.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.480]   I'm doing a speed test.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.280]   That's it.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   You buy chainsaw.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.560]   The first thing you do is cut down that tree branch and fell down the storm.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.800]   Then you spend the rest of the day playing.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.440]   I wonder if it'll kill this.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   Then you need a new sofa.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.920]   All right.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.520]   Let's talk about batteries because that was the story that kept poor Renee Richie working
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.000]   through the holiday break.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.320]   This story broke like the Christmas Eve.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   When did it break?
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   It was it never really broke.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   That was the thing.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.000]   Apple did this almost a year ago and then there was a Reddit thread about a guy who
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.880]   replaced his battery and got some attention and then John Poole from Geekbendron.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.240]   His geek like his benchmarks and it just it slowly started graining ground.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.520]   It was like a snowball just going downhill towards Christmas.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.280]   So but as usual Reddit is you know where you find this stuff.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:31.640]   This one 24 days ago PSA, iPhone Slow, try replacing your battery.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.560]   And so this one has been updated since the original post.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.240]   Apple at first didn't say anything.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.920]   There was just all of this information and then Apple finally said, yeah, they coped to
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   it.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   And they explained why.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.520]   So I'm going to rather than paraphrase Apple, I'm going to let you paraphrase Apple.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:57.120]   They said, we slow it down.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   Why?
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   So all right.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:06.280]   So what happened was about a year ago, there was this issue where iPhone six and some iPhone
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.880]   six S were draining fast and shutting down or just just shutting down even when they had
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   charge.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.760]   And it was a bit of a brew, haha and Apple eventually made a comment saying that there
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.120]   was a percentage of people who are having this issue and they were going to make changes
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   to try to prevent it.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.520]   There was a bad issue back then because you couldn't even restart the iPhones unless
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.720]   you went and physically plugged them in.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.320]   They were just off off.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   And so Apple did two things.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   One, they made it so that the iPhones could reboot without being connected to external
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.640]   power so they would come back on and they made a change in iOS 10.3.2.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.040]   Before that, they actually ran an earlier version of iOS that ran a bunch of diagnostics
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.480]   and tried to figure out what was going wrong, got the information and then used that to
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   make the update.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.520]   What they ended up doing was adding battery health power management to the throttling
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.080]   mechanism in iOS.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.040]   And all CPUs are almost always throttle typically for heat because if they get too hot, it's
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   incredibly damaging.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.920]   So the processor will start really fast and then ramp down as the heat builds up inside
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.040]   a device and iPhones are tiny, tiny little devices.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   But what this was doing was making sure that as the battery health deteriorated, especially
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.880]   if it was deteriorating quickly due to exposure to heat or exposure to cold or massive amounts
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.080]   of charge cycles, anything like that, it was no longer causing those power spikes which
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.040]   were causing the device to shut down.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   So everything sounded fine back then.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   Apple pushed out the update.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.640]   Everyone sort of went on with their lives.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.840]   And then as the devices got a little bit older and the batteries aged a little more, people
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:36.120]   started seeing profound performance degradation in some of these devices, maybe like by 25%
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.960]   or 33%.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.760]   And when you're dealing with an iPhone, that's quite a bit, especially because Apple is famous
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.040]   for single thread performance.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.200]   It's what makes the interface feel so snappy.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.480]   And it was not intuitive why it was happening because if your phone drains or it shuts off,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.840]   you might suspect the battery and you might take it in and get the battery serviced.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.280]   But if your phone is slow, you don't suspect the battery at all.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.960]   So people weren't really, they didn't understand what the problem was.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.160]   So this threaded thread came out and the guy changed the battery and suddenly everything
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.360]   was great.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.600]   And John Poole saw it who runs Geekbench and his wife's iPhone was slow and he started
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.160]   running all these benchmarks.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.480]   And it showed that how much certain iPhone models over time were downgrading or throttling
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.400]   the performance in order to maintain the battery life and prevent the shutdowns.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   And it wasn't all of them.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.080]   I think the figures that we're seeing is like 33% of them.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.720]   But that is when you're talking about iPhone owners, that is a huge number of devices.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.800]   So that became big news.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:35.280]   And then Apple started putting out statements, yes, we're doing this, what they call advanced
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.960]   power management, which is throttling on the CPU.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.880]   And then Leo, it just snowballed further.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.800]   And part of the problem is that there's always everyone keeps on saying that Apple's slowing
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   down their phones.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.240]   So there's a conspiracy theory that's been kind of that this is...
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.960]   It fits very well what people have been saying for a while, which is Apple wants you to buy
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   a new phone.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:57.920]   So when you get iOS 11, your older phone's not going to work as well.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.640]   And that's just to prod you into getting a new phone that's not for any technical reason.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:07.800]   Now let's give somebody, let's give people a TLDR because CR1 and somebody in the chat
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:14.760]   arm said, "I had explained this to every single family member the whole holiday season."
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.960]   So let me try this for now and see if this represents it fairly.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.800]   Because batteries in phones age...
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.880]   All batteries age.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   All batteries.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.520]   Yes.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.880]   And at some point, they won't be able to do the things they used to do.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:38.200]   So Apple, when in the operating system checks the battery, if it's an older battery, it
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.320]   will keep programs from doing things that are really taxing to the battery.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.360]   The choice would be the battery will shut down if it doesn't do this.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.680]   And that means the phone will show.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.400]   So Apple prefers to have a slower phone as you would probably, a slower phone with an
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.160]   old battery that's still in the phone that crashes all the time.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.000]   Or that still makes phone calls.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.880]   And this I learned today, Apple's software checks the battery.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   And if you put a new battery in...
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   It immediately gets better.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.360]   It immediately will speed up.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.840]   So it's not that the phone is old, it's that the battery is old.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.360]   And it's shipped like the iPhone...
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:19.680]   This only affects iPhone 6, iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, and with iOS 11.2, they're starting to
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.560]   bring iPhone 7 into it as well.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.640]   If you have an iPhone 5S earlier, it will still shut down.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.600]   And this also, this is not unique to Apple.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.480]   There's reports as of yesterday of Samsung Galaxy Note shutting down.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   And there's old stories about...
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:38.280]   Okay, so this is the second story, which is HTC, LG, Motorola, and Samsung, all Android
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.240]   handset manufacturers said, "We don't do this."
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.960]   Which led more fuel to the fire because...
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   But no, because if you go back a couple, even like one plus earlier this year, and several
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.680]   years ago, Anantec and Geekbench caught them never running their CPUs at peak.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.600]   Only for benchmark apps where they run them at peak.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.640]   And the reason Samsung gave them their statement was because they didn't want to overload the
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.240]   GPU or the CPU.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   And that's the same...
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.200]   We have increasingly desktop quality processors in devices that have teeny tiny little phone
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.720]   size batteries.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.080]   And you can't balance those things.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   You only have to make choices about which one you're gonna...
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.240]   You do, in fact, see this on even laptops.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.480]   You'll get an i7 on a laptop.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.160]   But because of thermal issues, you'll never see it run at full speed.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.640]   It'll always be somewhat slowed down.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.800]   So this is similar to that.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.840]   And iPads, well, like iPads, the battery is so big that it doesn't...
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   People have been asking about that a lot.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.920]   iPads, the battery is so big, the density is so high that it never hit even when the battery...
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.160]   The batteries have to get really, really old before you start seeing any unexpected shutdowns
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   or degradation.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.640]   So they don't do this on iPads.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.640]   They only do this on iPhones.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   No.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.280]   Yeah, it's not the SE was fairly modern.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.840]   But I guess it's an iPhone 6S.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   It's the iPhone 6S.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   Yeah, platform.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.720]   So it's the 6S, 6S, SE, and now the iPhone 7.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.760]   But you wouldn't see this on a brand new SE or an SE that's less than a year.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   So old.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.400]   How old does the battery have to be before that you start to see this?
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.880]   Apple will only replace it when it hits 80% capacity, which is the magic number for them.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.760]   But you might see this when it starts going to around 85%, which was also part of the problem
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.000]   because Apple care didn't really understand it.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.960]   And they were refusing to replace batteries that didn't hit that magic 80% number.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.240]   Even though damage is not always consistent, like if you put your iPhone on a radiator
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   or leave it out in the heat in Arizona or on an air vent in a freezing cold New England
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.960]   day, that heat damages that battery far greater than its age might otherwise integrate.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   Yes.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:34.800]   So Apple got some heat, if so to speak, for at first for the conspiracy theory that they
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.400]   were doing this on purpose.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.120]   Apple's explanation seems to have calmed most people down.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.280]   But people are still mad at Apple saying you should have communicated.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.280]   People are suing them.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.680]   And there's a $999 billion lawsuit against Apple.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.320]   I'm feeling really bad about this because Apple did like I don't know who was brief,
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.600]   but Apple did briefings for iOS 10.3.2 and their phone briefings where they sit you down
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.480]   and Apple's marketing team are incredibly smart.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.080]   They all of them have engineering degrees.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.880]   They really know their products and they explain the issue and what they were doing to
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   it.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.160]   And they talked about advanced battery power management.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.760]   And I never asked what that meant and I didn't bother to explain it, but there's no magic
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   involved.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   They didn't hide it.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   They just stop and nobody asked them.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   Well, but that's no.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:21.120]   They should have expressly said we are doing exactly ABCD in order to fix.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.000]   But the term they use was advanced.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.960]   And I know what that power management is because they throttle for thermals and I understand
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.520]   basically how this system works.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.600]   And it never occurred.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   They never explained it.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   I never asked.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.440]   And a year later I feel like complete moron.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.200]   And it's not entirely on me, but I do feel my responsibility.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.320]   No, that's totally beside the point.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.080]   It's like just last month of the month before my MacBook battery started to die and I got
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.840]   a warning from the operating system saying, hey, your battery is starting to become really,
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.480]   really unhealthy followed by, hey, your battery is definitely broken.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.960]   You definitely need to get it replaced right now.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.400]   So there's you have to we have to wonder what Apple's excuse was for not putting up some
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.360]   sort of a dialogue or some sort of a checkbox at some point saying, hey, I noticed that your
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.840]   battery is really, really old.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.880]   I think you're going to want to take it back to get the battery replaced soon.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.160]   If you here's it's also making sure people know that if you go to the Apple store, they'll
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.760]   charge you only about like 99 bucks out of warranties, 79 bucks or something when it's
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   closer to warranty or release and just inform this people inform people that this is what's
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.880]   going on and this is what we're going to do to make your experience better.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.400]   And that people would have liked that as opposed to all the people that in the past year have
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.920]   come to me saying, Hey, my battery for some reason my phone is really, really slow.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.440]   All of a sudden I don't know why that's happened.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.080]   And people coming to the leaving to the conclusion that Apple has slowed has intentionally slowed
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.520]   down my phone because they want to get me to buy a new one.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.200]   At which point, you know, you have I have to explain to them that Apple is really, really
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:57.680]   good at making you make an emotional decision to buy a new phone without without crippling
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   your old one.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.000]   I mean, this was clearly a problem over the past year and was something that as simple
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.440]   as tell the tell the pilot the status of their aircraft at all times don't there's no reason
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.600]   for Apple to have hidden this from the user.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.960]   So it doesn't matter whether Apple should have briefed the press or briefed other people
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.300]   about what was happening last year.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.840]   You tell the user that I'm going to make your phone go really slow right now.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.620]   And this is why I'm making that happen.
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:28.720]   And if worse comes the worse, if you would rather just have the phone die at 40% that's
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   up to you.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.680]   But here's what's happening with your phone and what we want to do about it.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.480]   So there was a there was a problem with this though.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.760]   There was a dialogue Apple did put it into you into the battery settings, but it wasn't
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   a pop up.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.760]   You had to go look for it.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.480]   And also it seems to be triggered way too late in the cycle.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.320]   Like you seem to be down throttled well before that dialogue.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.720]   I was actually talking to John pulling a podcast and he's like, I never got a dialogue.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   Oh, there it is.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.720]   Oh, so he saw it.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   How funny.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.560]   Yeah, which was much later than when he ran all his tests, which isn't really helpful
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   to him.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.720]   And I think it almost would have been better if Apple let your phone fail once you absolutely
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.920]   understand the problem.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.600]   And then when it came up that said your iPhone shut down unexpectedly, we can manage this
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.480]   so it won't happen again, but you will have reduced performance.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   Do you want to do that or do you want to make a genius appointment?
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.880]   And I think a lot of times, you know, Apple works pretty hard at not having people may
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   have to make decisions.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.840]   You're like, you know, I think that's I mean, I think that's the.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.480]   If Apple fails in communication, it's always that.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.320]   Yeah, it's always like, we're good for you.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.320]   You don't need to know this.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   We're just going to handle it.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   And they're right.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.120]   99% of people wouldn't notice except for all the news stories.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.120]   Right.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   And it fits in with the conspiracy.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.880]   But I had like, I think they did the right thing though, because now they've been
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.800]   announced final point in the story that they're going to offer battery upgrades for
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.280]   $50 off 29 bucks.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   29 bucks is great.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   It's nothing.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   What are what are the what's the criterion for that?
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:48.160]   Do you have to prove that it's 85% or 80% was the old criteria, but it's my understanding.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.880]   And I think Apple's going to talk about this later today.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.400]   It's my understanding that or they gave Mac rumors, maybe a comment about it already.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.920]   They're going to start to start doing it way before they originally said they originally
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.240]   said they were going to do it mid January because they want a time to ramp up supply,
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.720]   but they said they're going to start doing it now and they'll ramp up as they go.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.920]   And apparently they're not going to worry about the diagnostics.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.960]   Like maybe if you bring a brand new phone in, they'll say, dude, this is a brand new
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   phone.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   It's 100%.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   You don't need a replacement.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.040]   But if your phone is anywhere on the, you know, as any sort of significant where to it,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.040]   I think you're just going to replace it.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   No questions asked.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.760]   It says, according to the story, I just saw in Mac rumors that you they won't do any
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   diagnostic tests.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   They'll just go, okay.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.920]   Based on the age of that phone and go ahead and a $29 like that's like, I can't imagine anything
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.720]   less than anything more than cost.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.320]   I mean, for Apple, because that's just to get them to go through.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.320]   They'll just labor.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.320]   That's the labor cost.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   Just the labor cost.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.320]   So will they do it on the spot?
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.320]   The genius will take it in the back.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   They have a machine, right?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.320]   That opens it up.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.720]   I mean, some models, I believe are easier than others.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.240]   And I don't, I don't know offhand this about the six success and SE.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.520]   I don't imagine they'll be doing too many sevens at this point, but it could be just
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.620]   as simple as that.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.560]   If you brought in a seven and said, Hey, I don't, it feels slow with it.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   That's a year old now, but you know, you never know.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.360]   See, that's a problem is that there's, there's two problems.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.000]   The one, the first one I mentioned is that people now are equating performance to battery,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.600]   but also there's a bunch of reasons why your iPhone might be slower than it was before.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.040]   And only one of them is battery related.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.400]   And people are, it's going to be an easy excuse for anything.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.840]   Oh, my iPhone is slow and they'll just bring it in and they go, but you're running Snapchat
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.280]   24 hours a day.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.520]   You know, your wife, that's, that's just going to bog down your iPhone.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.440]   You're running photo filters all the time that's slowing down your.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.840]   So I think there's going to be a little bit of education involved, but for most people,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.480]   if you're having any problem at all, just take it in and get it swapped.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   I'm on dog and I chat.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   It says, consider the Apple technician, the Apple genius who isn't apprised of this information,
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.760]   who's trying to figure out why your phone is slow, acknowledges it's slow, but doesn't
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.840]   know why it's slow.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   Is that the case?
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.480]   Is that until now the technicians, the geniuses didn't even know about this?
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   Some did.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   Some didn't.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   It seems like it wasn't like again, Apple should have made sure that every once they put that
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.440]   patch out that information was then projected to everybody was a customer service facing
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   role.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   I think you're right.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:47:00.560]   I think Renee and I probably have the same sort of reaction to bad tech news.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.920]   You kind of gauge how bad PR problem this is by how many times in the course of a day
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.200]   do I get a call from a radio station wanting me to come on the show and talk about this
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   thing.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.520]   Where it's like with net neutrality, it wasn't as many people as I had hoped, but when it becomes
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:23.760]   something as easy for people to understand as is Apple crippling the speed of your phone.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.240]   I had everybody got that one.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.680]   I basically had a block out an afternoon just to handle all the Skype stuff and all the phone
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   stuff.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:38.680]   That's just to say that this is a problem that was so easy for people to understand.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.480]   It's a very, very good thing for Apple to have responded this quickly and this transparently
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.560]   in saying that, "Hey, here's the problem.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.840]   Here it is in detail and we're going to make it so easy for you to swap out a battery that
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.440]   you will just come down just to use the free Wi-Fi.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.040]   Why don't you get a replacement battery while you're here having your orange julius?"
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.680]   Who should do this?
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   You can download.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.200]   There are plenty of somebody in the chatroom scooter I think was saying.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.280]   The coconut battery monitor is a good one, but you can download a battery.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   Apple's going to push their own.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.440]   Apple is going to do an software update for iOS because those apps can't really get close
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.280]   to the metal the way that Apple can.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.560]   An upcoming version of iOS, it might be 2.5.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   It might be 3.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.600]   It's going to have battery health indicator the way they currently have the battery usage
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   indicator.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.520]   You'll get a good idea about it.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.040]   It's also a good reminder that because your Apple, if you have an Apple store nearby,
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.560]   it doesn't cost anything for them to diagnose a problem for you.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.840]   If you're having any problem whatsoever, anything that's going weird with a device,
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.600]   definitely, if you just make it a point that the next time you're near the mall or near
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.720]   the store, make an appointment, have it checked out.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.160]   Even if it's something that is, this is a device that's 2 or 3 years old, it's well
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   out of warranty.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.160]   I was thinking about buying a new iPhone anyway.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.600]   You never know what they can do for you.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.360]   My own experience with that MacBook battery was they wound up seeing that there were a
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.320]   couple of damaged cells inside the battery pack.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.400]   Even though it was a well out of warranty, they decided to give me a new battery, no charge
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.360]   for labor, no charge for hardware.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:12.200]   Apple service is a rather awesome and you're denying yourself some excellence if you don't
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   take advantage of it.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.120]   That's what it speaks to the conspiracy theory is too, because when you talk to Apple to
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.720]   a person, they never want to make you feel like you're forced to get a new phone, because
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.000]   they recognize there's a danger you'll switch to another company.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.840]   If you're angry enough at your iPhone, your next phone might not be an iPhone, and they
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.280]   figure it is better, easier, and ultimately nobler for them to just make your experience
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.760]   so great with this iPhone that by default your next phone will be an iPhone.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:43.120]   If you have an iPhone 6S or an SE, should you just go to the Apple store today?
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.520]   Yeah, they'll not today, but definitely.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.680]   At Andy's point, maybe not today because everyone's there.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.720]   Right now you just do it the same way.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.160]   You do it the same way you would request any sort of battery exchange, but they're going
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:50:00.840]   to put specific information up on apple.com for how this swap is going to happen.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.680]   Oh, so don't just wander in.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   You can for now.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.640]   For now, just go make an appointment the way you would to get your battery changed if
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.400]   nothing else had happened, but I guess because they're anticipating huge volumes for this,
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.000]   they're going to have specific instructions available.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.400]   If you have a 7, maybe not so much, or I guess it's up to you.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:25.000]   Problem with slow is it's so subjective that people psychologically might say, "Well, this
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   just feels slow."
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.760]   I have a success that I know that I felt it was really so slow that I bought another one
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.760]   pretty quick.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:35.520]   The next year, because it was sluggish, and so I definitely think that there's, and I
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.000]   probably, and other things that affect your battery health are things like leaving plugged
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.320]   in all night, which I try to avoid doing when I can, because if it sits and does this little
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:49.440]   trickle on and off, on and off, on and off, it's really bad for your battery.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:56.400]   In our chatroom, former Genius 937 says, "As a former Genius, they don't tell us anything
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.680]   until the public already knows."
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.160]   So geniuses weren't told there wasn't a bullet and then went out as there should have been
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:08.320]   probably, "Hey, just so you know, what version of iOS did this start with today?"
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.080]   It was a 3.3.2 for the iPhone 6 platform and 11.2 for the iPhone 7 platform.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.080]   Okay.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.840]   So, what's the reason when was that?
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.480]   That was last year sometime.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:23.000]   It was last February for the iPhone 6s and just the last update for the iPhone 7s.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.440]   And you may have gotten that update and not seen any change, and then your battery got
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.600]   below 80 percent.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.160]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.040]   And then you would see the change all of a sudden.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   It was terrible.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.880]   I was having breakfast with a friend who, as happens every couple of months, someone was
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.920]   coming to me with, "Hey, where's my phone slow?"
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.280]   All of a sudden.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.480]   And I went through the usual list of reasons why, again, without knowledge of the battery
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.520]   issue at this point, or at least with it being a friend of my mind.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.360]   And it wasn't until like three or four days later that I was able to come back to them
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.960]   with all the data saying, "Here's what's going on with your phone."
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.760]   Because usually when someone comes to me with a problem and I don't have a specific answer,
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.640]   I will then, even if I tried and failed months earlier, I'll try again to see what's out
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.640]   there.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.480]   And he went out and decided to buy a new phone after two or three years anyway.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.320]   But that's exactly, it's just because it goes to show that this is what is on people's
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   minds, that my phone is slow.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.760]   They don't understand everything that goes into the performance of a device.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.440]   And so buying a new one, if that was in the back of your mind anyway, that's going to
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.600]   be where they're going to go to.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:31.240]   And then they will feel a little bit of resentment that I didn't, I should, God's plan for when
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:37.200]   I buy a new phone is when I leave it behind in an airplane seat or drop it down a toilet.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:42.560]   It should not be because it is now too slow to do the stuff that I want to do with it.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.920]   And we do like get more intense.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.760]   Like Anna Moji hits an iPhone 10 really hard and portrait lighting hits an iPhone 8 really
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.560]   hard and portrait mode hits an iPhone 7 real hard.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.400]   And we're putting things in here that are incredibly demanding on incredibly powerful
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.440]   processors that essentially have the same batteries that we've had for years.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.640]   And they're getting better at managing them, but the battery chemistry isn't getting better.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:06.480]   I was amazed that when I flew back from Pittsburgh last last week, my daughter was able to burn
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:13.920]   through a new iPad Pro in two and a half hours playing Minecraft.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.280]   That's like the only half the flight.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.680]   Let me really point that out.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.960]   Only half the flight.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.240]   So somebody said I said something wrong.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.880]   Teddy says, where did Apple say that the throttle begins at less than 80%?
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.880]   They said a year.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.880]   Leo is wrong.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.080]   Is it time or is it checking the battery?
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   It's not time at all.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.840]   Apple hasn't said how they do it.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.760]   And there have been some guesses and an ant tech said maybe it's a simple like it hits a
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.560]   clock and it goes off or maybe it's something dynamic where it's continually in the state.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.560]   We don't know that part.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:48.760]   My experience with software that checks lithium ion batteries and I have it on a lot of laptops
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.160]   is it can say battery health.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.080]   So it shows and it's in milliamp hours.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.080]   It's in capacity.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.560]   It shows the nominal capacity when the batteries new.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.880]   And then the current capacity based on how many charge cycles it's gone through and how
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.640]   much heat and whatever stress it's gone through.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:11.040]   And those battery sensors, I don't know if it's specious or not, but they seem to be
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   able to say, here's your battery health.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.640]   Here's the maximum charge you get.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:21.160]   And what you're saying, Renee, is it's somewhere around 85 or 80% of the maximum.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   That's when this is going to kick in.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.520]   80% is the mark when Apple will change your battery.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   That's when they'll give you a new battery.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.000]   They haven't said what the mark is for this.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   They haven't said when this kicks in.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.320]   It would be somewhere around the level where the battery is no longer considered.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.280]   So I mean, Apple knows the battery health.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.400]   There's no reason for them to use a simple calendar.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.400]   Right.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.040]   I mean, that varies per user.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.200]   If you don't charge your phone that often.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.600]   You don't charge it that often if you don't leave it plugged in for too long a period of
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   time.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.920]   If you don't put it out in the excessive heat, if you don't excessive cold.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.320]   Which is also what helps iPads because people don't charge them as much.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.400]   They don't use it about the cold or out of the heat.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:58.800]   The best thing is to just make sure it sounds counterintuitive.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.920]   But make sure that if there's a battery power device you spend as much time using it on
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.640]   battery as possible.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:11.400]   That it sort of had to retrain myself to make sure that my laptop, my phone, my tablets,
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   everything that I will just charge it up when it's charged.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.280]   I unplug it and then I drain the battery down to at least 20% before it considered charging
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   up again.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.640]   That's the way that you lead to the best health for the battery lifetime.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:28.080]   And Apple will also tell you that they're doing a lot of, like what Andy and Alex are saying
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.640]   are absolutely true and there's all sorts of things.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.880]   You don't want it to get hot.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.080]   Fast chargers are technically worse than slow chargers.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.360]   So while you're saying, "Oh, we're behind on Qualcomm.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.560]   Fast chargers hit the chemicals and the battery much harder than regular chargers."
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.080]   But Apple's going to do everything it can to manage the charge up to the 50% mark so
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.160]   you can charge quicker.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.560]   You can charge longer.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.720]   You can go back on battery more often.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.040]   It's just, it's going to manage as best as possible.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.800]   But if you want the utmost battery help.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:57.000]   So, and Renee, you shouldn't charge your phone with 2.4 amps.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.680]   If you talk to Apple, they will say use the iPod plug, use all those things because we'll
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.040]   manage it and we'll degrade it when we need to.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.240]   We'll increase it when we need to.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.680]   We'll automatically dip it down.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.720]   We'll automatically push it back up.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.640]   So a lot of the old tips for lithium ion don't seem to be as important now because they're
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.480]   doing all that for us.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.480]   But I'm still conservative.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.400]   I still use the small charger overnight because I'm sleeping.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.520]   I don't need it to charge in three hours.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.520]   I'm asleep.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.440]   It can charge as slowly as it wants to.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.480]   And I don't use quick charges when I don't have to.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.600]   And I try to follow all those practices.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.600]   And I wear it down when I can.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.600]   Okay.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.440]   Have we flattened this?
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.800]   I think we flattened this story.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.120]   There's one less question though I'd ask all of you.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.240]   Did Apple handle this properly?
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   I'd take it Andy.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.320]   You don't think so.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:45.280]   They handle it properly once it became a big fuffle monger.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.120]   But once, but before that, yeah, they definitely should have.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:52.600]   There's no reason for them not to have made it explicit to the user what they were doing
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:57.840]   to the device when that was happening, especially now that we all know we've had this really,
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:03.000]   really transparent knowledge of this is what people think about Apple.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.920]   They don't think that, oh, there's a problem with my phone.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.000]   It needs to be fixed.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.400]   They think that, oh, my phone has become obsolete after only two and a half years.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.200]   They want me to buy a brand new one.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.240]   So but they responded to that.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.960]   They responded to this very, very well.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.040]   They didn't blame the user.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.040]   They didn't.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.040]   They just said, here's what's happening.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.200]   They probably could have been a little bit more transparent with this.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.760]   And here's how we're making sure that people who need new batteries will get new batteries.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.560]   Do you agree?
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.440]   I'd say the initial, the initial communication was not good.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:32.960]   I feel like that their reaction to it was, was better than most.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:38.520]   I mean, definitely better than I think Samsung did with their battery issue, which was catching
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.520]   fire.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.520]   So I think that I think Apple did better than most companies do once they were in a bind.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.040]   I think that they got out in front of it.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   They made an offer.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.360]   They said, this is how we're going to handle it.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.640]   The offer, I think, is very fair.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   I think in a lot of ways, we're getting a pretty good deal.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.360]   If you've got an older, if you've got an older phone and you're able to now replace
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.280]   it for 29 bucks, the whole thing is a pretty awesome thing to have happen is you're going
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:02.480]   to get a new battery for as little as you're going to get it for the same price as a cable.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.480]   Right.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.920]   Well, to give us some sense, I think I fix it.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.840]   If you do the labor yourself charges 29 bucks for the battery, I think that's their price.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.000]   It's a killer deal.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   It's a killer deal.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.800]   There's a lot of people winning out on this already.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:22.440]   I think that also, I think to Apple's probably strategic credit, is it really is going to
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   make the lawsuit complicated because people are benefiting from it already.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   A lot of good will, I think, accrues to Apple for being quick and you agree, Ray?
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:38.080]   Yeah, I think, again, they should have explained this much better from the start.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.600]   I think their reaction was good.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   You'll never please anybody.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.680]   I saw people on Twitter today going, "Oh, this is Apple's sneaky plan to get a bunch
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.400]   of batteries moving through their supply chain."
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.120]   You will never make everybody happy, but I think their response was as good as possible.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.840]   I agree, this is a great deal for people who have older devices that are going to have
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.320]   a new battery.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.600]   That's a big part of the experience of the device.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   Go get it.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   Go get it.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.720]   This is coconut battery.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   This is a battery health program that works on iPhone, iPad, iPod, Touch, as well as Macintosh.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:15.400]   It gives you the basic ... I think I use this on my ... I use something like this anyway
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.360]   on my laptops.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:21.400]   It shows you the number of charges, the cycle count, all with the my batteries as NIO is
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.400]   pointing out in the chart and have a cycle count.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:29.960]   More to the point, what's your designed capacity and your current capacity and what percentage
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.080]   of the design capacity are you getting?
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:38.360]   That's relevant to ... The temperature, it is affected by a lot of things, obviously.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.560]   All right.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.520]   I think battery gate can now be put to bed.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.840]   We can close the battery gate.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.640]   Close the case on battery gate.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.200]   What do you ... Given that the Android guys jumped on this and said, "Well, we don't do
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.680]   this," you think they're just letting it crash?
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   Their phone's crashed.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.440]   I think they're doing exactly what Apple used to do and what they still do for the 5S.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.080]   Again, it's physics and chemistry.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.800]   There's no way to cheat on this stuff.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.600]   There's no OS level battery management to the extent that Apple is doing on Android.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:16.960]   That's really not a ... That's like a car manufacturer saying, "Well, we will never
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.480]   compromise the performance of our cars with traction control."
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.880]   We would never do that.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   We would never do that.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.400]   The car's safe.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.520]   There's also a mitigation on Android where Apple has got incredibly good single-core performance
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.240]   and most of the Android chipsets don't come near that, so they're not causing those spikes.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.920]   Often they have bigger batteries, which means they can stay in the spikes a little bit better.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920]   Interesting.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   When you're putting things together, you're offsetting it a little bit, but as we've seen,
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   it happens.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.320]   It's just happening at different points.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.360]   Because of all the different kinds of hardware, you really have to build the solution for
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.280]   the battery pack that you're creating.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.440]   Google would really have to create a brand new section of the OS just for battery life
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.080]   management and make sure that it gets a profile for every phone out there.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.920]   This is shot in Florida on the part of the Android manufacturer's nonsense.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.200]   Eight lawsuits to date, including that $999 billion lawsuit.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   It did.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   It feels like.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.240]   Apparently in France there's a lawsuit launched because it's against the law.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:25.520]   France is one of the few countries where you can't have planned obsolescence.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.240]   But again, that goes to what Apple's saying about this.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.720]   This wasn't planned obsolescence.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.360]   I think they've successfully defended that.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.640]   I think this fundamentally comes down to whether how you use your phone.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.240]   I think Apple's making sure that you can use it as a phone for as long as possible.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.080]   It slows down all the other bits and pieces of it so that it can keep on doing that so
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.040]   that you don't have the issues.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.880]   I've had one of the phones, one of those phones that was dying at 40%, which was mind-numbingly
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.640]   frustrating because you're in constant frustration and fear that your phone was going to turn
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640]   off.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.520]   It was really a thing that became upsetting.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.760]   I would have rather have it slowed down.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.440]   The one thing I will say when we're talking about charging, I think there's some confusion
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.920]   in the IRC in the chat window about Renee said he charges overnight.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.200]   I said don't charge, don't leave it on overnight.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.840]   I think it depends.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.680]   The idea is that if you're charging it slower, it's better, but you don't want to leave it
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:27.600]   just sitting there on a charge all the time.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.960]   What I do, I actually have all of my cables at home.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.600]   I have LEDs in them.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.440]   They look kind of cool because it comes out of one of those anchors.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.400]   They all have LED and you see them all moving.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.720]   The reason I do that is so that I can look up and see that something's not charging anymore.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   I just unplug it.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.160]   See, I leave mine on.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.400]   I have been told that all lithium-ion, modern lithium-ion batteries have circuitry so that
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.240]   they don't overcharge A, which would be one concern.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.120]   Of course, what is happening is they're going down a little bit and up a little bit.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.480]   That's the problem.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.760]   The number of cycles is a total charge discharge.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.600]   I've been told that little start stop starts off in the battery.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.000]   Even that's bad for the battery.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.840]   One of the batteries is bad for the battery.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.480]   It's not a full cycle, but it's still there.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   By the way, there's a lot of information, some misinformation about batteries in general.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.120]   Also, they change because the battery management systems can change.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.960]   Even battery experts disagree.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.840]   Chemistry is complicated.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.560]   I've had battery experts in here and they had disagreements between them.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.600]   I was talking to Carl Howell, a longtime analyst, and he had a great analogy.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.000]   He said, "You know, Apple is sitting there like a person running the power grid, and
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.720]   they're going, 'I have a blackout coming,' or a brownout coming.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.600]   Level one is blackout, level two is brownout."
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   Which one do I pull?
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   Yeah, to pick the brownout.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.400]   I think what your choice is.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400]   Yeah, brownout.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.240]   So yeah, I think part of it is that most of us aren't going to be using this device for
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.560]   more than a few years.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   So a little bit of wear on the lithium-ion battery overcomes.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.080]   It's really been on a wireless charger.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080]   Right?
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   All night.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080]   Now I'm thinking I shouldn't do that.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   I don't know.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.880]   You think the best thing to do is let it...
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.760]   You don't want to run it down too low.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   We've been...
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.560]   I'm giving the advice, and this is actually from Steve Gibson, who I think found this information
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:25.120]   on battery experts' site, that leave battery-powered devices plugged in.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.880]   If you're storing it, store it at half charge.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.720]   And heat's bad, but there's no conditioning.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.160]   Oh, and the one other bad thing is to fully discharge it.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.840]   You don't want to fully, like, completely drain a lithium-ion battery.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.960]   But the advice I've been giving, and this is from Steve, and I'll have to ask Steve,
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960]   is leave it plugged in.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   Apple has a data on it.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   Because you have a laptop, leave it plugged in.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   You can go to Apple Support.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.240]   They have a whole page on how to take care of lithium-ion batteries, broken down per product
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.240]   as well.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:05:01.160]   But you'll get a new device with lithium-ion batteries, and in the box is completely wrong
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.440]   instructions about things like conditioning.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.800]   Don't use this unless you charge it all the way conditioning.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   It's hard to test it.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   You'll be really committed.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.560]   It's like, in a year, I'm going to buy six phones, and I'm going to treat them differently
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560]   over the next year.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.320]   It's just hard to know exactly which one is the best one.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.720]   I guess for me, the theory is what I read made sense, and so what I do is I have chargers
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.880]   everywhere that I can immediately do.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:27.040]   It's inconvenient, though, for most people not to just plug it in at night and have it
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.200]   fully charged in the morning.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.800]   When there's inductive charging pads everywhere, Leo will just trickle charge all day and we'll
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   never have to think about it again.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.880]   That's what Alex is saying is bad.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.360]   Well, I don't worry that much about...
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.120]   The thing is, you have to think about the larger workflow.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.680]   For me, for the phone, I need to make sure I don't forget to charge it.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.400]   And if that's part of my routine, that I go to...
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.840]   I get into bed.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.360]   I put my phone onto the charger on the nightstand.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.240]   That will make sure this is 100% battery as opposed to wondering why I've had such a
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.760]   quiet morning and it's because my battery died at 4 AM.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.840]   So I'm getting no text and no notifications.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.240]   So whatever works for you, I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit of battery survivability
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   for that.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.680]   For notebooks, however, I would say that's don't leave it plugged in.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:21.520]   I would just say that at some point during the course of the week, you have to make sure
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.120]   you unplug it and let that battery exercise itself because I really do think that's what
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.960]   causes a lot of batteries to die prematurely.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.320]   If you never get it, give it a chance to discharge.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:37.600]   If it's always going between 98% and 100% all the time, because it's being left on charger,
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.000]   I do think that that's what kills the battery much, much earlier than it would otherwise.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.440]   Often the heat associated with charging.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.880]   So if you are charging or charging long or charging often, that builds up heat and heat
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.280]   degrades the chemistry and all that.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:54.120]   It's always heat-leo, heats the enemy.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.600]   I don't know what the answer is on this.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.200]   I think there's a lot of misinformation.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.560]   If you Google, should I leave my laptop plugged in all the time?
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.360]   There's lots of conflicting information.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.080]   What I really want is not how to geek or grist or phosphates.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.720]   I want a battery guru.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:22.400]   So if you're a battery guru, here's one from askleo.com.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.400]   Not me.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.200]   If you're a battery guru, Rick's daily tips.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:32.320]   Everybody has an answer for this, but I think a lot of this is more anecdotal than science-based.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:37.280]   If you're a battery expert, please.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.240]   My attitude is there's circuitry and modern batteries that protect it against overcharge,
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.600]   overheating, they can slow down the charge.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.240]   There's actually a battery university.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.240]   Yeah, that's the place I've quoted before.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.640]   What does battery universities say?
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   It's too long.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   Too many words.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.400]   I think battery university is the one that told me to leave it plugged in, but I don't
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   know.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400]   They have all these graphs.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.000]   Just give me a list of what I was supposed to do.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Chemistry is hard.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   Yeah, I know.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.240]   Which is funny because what's happening is your battery is actually going more than
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   more stable.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.240]   It's lack of life.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   It's entropy.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:17.520]   There's more electrons that have found each other, go, "Hey, let's just stick together.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.320]   Let's not get the next time we get electricity."
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.480]   Battery university.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.760]   How to prolong lithium-ion-based batteries.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:31.480]   Read that and get back to us, would you?
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.480]   I guess the most...
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.040]   If you just take away the fact that batteries can be replaced, even if the thing is sealed
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.360]   up, there's a way to replace the battery from the manufacturer or from a nice lovely
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.320]   informational page on IFixit.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   There are almost certainly going to be a utility you can download for that device.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.680]   We'll tell you the health of that battery.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.320]   You'll burn your hand on the stove and that will teach you exactly what you've been doing
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.040]   wrong with charging your battery.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.200]   It'll work out okay.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.200]   It'll be okay.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.440]   It's even though 2017 is over with, we still have far bigger problems in this world than
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   do I get this?
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.040]   Does my battery last for 4.8 years or 4.4 years?
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.800]   Here's the salient paragraph from Battery University.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.320]   The question is asked, "Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not used?"
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.200]   Under normal circumstances, this should not be necessary because charging stops on the
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.560]   lithium-ion battery is full.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.280]   A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.440]   Most users do not row the AC power.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.400]   This practice is safe.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.320]   They say, "What can the user do?
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.000]   Environmental conditions not cycling along govern the longevity of lithium-ion batteries.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.200]   The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures."
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.360]   I often tell my wife that as we discuss the fact that I like to keep the house at 64
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.360]   degrees because the better battery could be prolonged by lowering the charge voltage
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.760]   when connected to the AC grid.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.080]   Do you have that capability?
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.880]   To make this user-friendly device should feature a long life mode that keeps the battery at
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.040]   a certain voltage.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:13.200]   A lot of this is done automatically in the circuitry on your laptop and your phone.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.640]   What even battery universities are somewhat equivocal in their advice?
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.320]   The bottom link I just posted, Leo, is Apple's maximizing performance, which is their tips
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.200]   on how to take care of each Apple product.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.720]   Given it's an Apple device, do what Apple says.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.560]   At least it doesn't come with a warning.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:40.160]   One of the drones I got, the Iris drone, it has all these warnings about not to ever leave
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.000]   the batteries alone by themselves.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.760]   It comes with a fire shield.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.560]   I got the wrong...
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.640]   People are asking me when I get on the plane, "Do you have any lithium-ion batteries?"
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.040]   Well, of course I do.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.520]   I have a phone.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.520]   Of course I do.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   Some people have an advantage.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.520]   And that's been an issue lately, too.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520]   Of course I do.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.040]   My backpack now is full of all these batteries for all my stuff because I pack all the gear
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.840]   and then I pack all the batteries into my backpack because I can't check them anymore.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.520]   And now my way bag, that's the new problem.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.480]   Fortunately, I'm flying United, which hasn't put the crackdown on, but Delta, American...
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   A lot of them do that.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.680]   Have now said you can't...
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   You can't check it.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   You can't check it.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.240]   You have to carry everything all your electronics on the plane.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:32.440]   I did get on a one plane because I got to the thing on a little puddle jumper and they
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   said, "Oh, you have to check the bag?"
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.480]   And I said, "I can't because it's in a way bag and you guys don't let me check those."
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.480]   And then they went, "Okay, you can go ahead."
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   And I was like, "I think of it."
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   I think that is awesome.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   Even they don't understand.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.400]   I like to have the Iron Man suit in there.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.880]   So here, I do have a quadcopter drone tip for you though.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.280]   Don't try to fly your Mavic Pro in a heavy wind at sea while the boat is pitching.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.520]   Oh, that didn't turn out too well.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   Day one.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   Oh.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.080]   It does fly very cold.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.080]   I've tested it very cold.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.080]   It flew just fine.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.160]   In fact, it really attempted.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.360]   It was really interesting to keep position.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.880]   It was the operator who was trying to land the thing as the boat's going like this and
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880]   the wind's going like this.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.360]   And then it hit the wire guardrail and it went in the water.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.080]   At that point, I wasn't diving in.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.600]   I was watching Michael's video on his drone and he loved the drone so much and he's flying
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.840]   it and it goes over a building and never comes back.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840]   He's just so sad.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840]   He's gone.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.360]   So anybody, I have the extra batteries, the extra wings thing, the charger.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.360]   Anybody needs that.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.400]   I just don't have the drone.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.400]   Everything but the drone.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.080]   I have a battery that just won't work.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.080]   The power field minus car.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080]   Smart batteries.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   I'll trade you a battery.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080]   You have a Mavic Pro, right?
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080]   I do.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.840]   I was thinking, so I have two choices now.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.240]   I could just buy a new Mavic Pro for $1,000.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240]   Yeah, extra batteries.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.920]   And I have plenty of batteries.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.000]   Or I could buy like that, what's the one with the better camera?
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.120]   DJI Phantom 4.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120]   But that's like $3,000.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:10.440]   The one that I'm going to get soon is probably going to be the Inspire 2 with ZenMooz X7.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.440]   How much is that?
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.760]   It's not cheap.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.040]   I just bought an iMac Pro.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.600]   I won't be buying anything for the rest of the year.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600]   I bought this game.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.600]   I'm about the same as your iMac Pro.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.600]   I just bought the iMac Pro.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.600]   Thank you.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.600]   I wish I could fly back.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.040]   If you just get a controller, I bought this before the end of the year.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.040]   So that's a text action.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.040]   There you go.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   There you go.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.720]   Anyway, you want my batteries, you can have them.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.720]   I brought them back.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.560]   I thought it'd be a mistake for me to buy another drone.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.920]   My history with drones is not good.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.560]   The Mavic, I have to say the Mavic has been my best casual.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560]   It's really a really good one.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560]   Truly, truly a rather than a really good one.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   I've had the best luck with the Mavic.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.160]   Oh, the Mavic, that's why I was confident.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.360]   On dry land, when it's not pitching and there's no high winds, it's fine.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.080]   I had a problem with it over the last week.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.120]   It was drifting, like GPS drift, like it would just slowly drift to the side.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.320]   I think I just didn't have the...
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.000]   But it was too cold to calibrate because it was six degrees outside and I couldn't feel
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   my hands.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.080]   I would kill it for a balmy six degrees right now.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.200]   I've got in a month or two all the Amazon credits that I got from recommending books and stuff
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.960]   during Black Friday is going to come in.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.480]   I try to make it a point to spend that money on silly things and I'm finding it so...
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:24.600]   I'm finding the draw of the drone just so compelling at this point.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.120]   It is so much fun.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   Drones have become...
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.560]   I've been using them for years and crashing them for years and I've gone through a lot
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560]   of drones.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.440]   And it's finally gotten to a point where it actually works.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.440]   And actually, you know, you just...
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   Oh, I'm going to go...
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.400]   I carry this little mavic around all the time in my backpack and I'm just like, "Oh, I think
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.840]   I'm going to do a little drone work."
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840]   And just fly around.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.560]   I use it for establishing shots for our live shot shows.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.080]   I mean, all kinds of stuff.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.520]   And it's just so much fun.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.960]   And it just looks so epic.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.760]   I was doing these flyovers of my parents' house, which is in the middle of nowhere.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.720]   And it's just this huge...
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.720]   You feel like you're watching a movie, like a big feature film.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.360]   And it's fun.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.360]   I would highly recommend.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360]   Even just a small one, just like a little...
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.360]   The mavic is great.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360]   I like the...
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360]   I don't know.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.360]   I haven't had a lot of...
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360]   I've heard it really well.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.360]   I've heard it really well.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.360]   I've heard it really well.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   I really liked it.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.360]   I'm going to be living next to a river.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   I just want to get one and fly it out over the river.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360]   But I got the mavic specifically so I can wreck it.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   That's exactly the same thing with me.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:25.680]   Now that I'm living in like a sort of a downtown sort of area, it's like all the way from...
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.360]   Hey, was that the FedEx truck I just heard?
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.040]   I'll send out the drawing to like the Recanoder.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   There's a beautiful...
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.040]   There's a great sandwich shop next door that I...
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   Can the mavic support just a tiny basket and maybe not the 12 inch hero sandwich, but maybe
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.040]   the six inch sub?
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.040]   Your drone has to have a hat and the chops.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.040]   Because that way we just have the Andy drone going down the streets.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040]   It would be awesome.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040]   You guys are making lasers.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   And lasers.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040]   And lasers.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.040]   You can have to go get another one.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.040]   I'm not going to get another one.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.040]   I guess.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   I learned my last one.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   I guess Leo doesn't want one of Renee and Andy's drone sandwiches then.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   That's fine.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   It's just more drone sandwiches for Renee and Andy.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   You can just see some common sense.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   There's a certain level of...
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   I walked outside and I felt a little wind.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.040]   If I look up and see the trees vibrating a little bit, I'm like, "This is not a flight
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   day."
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   You know, like this is...
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   I'm going to go back in because I want to keep my drone.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   I want to keep my drone.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.040]   I feel like just like the lunar rover, when they start flying like a polymer mission with
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.040]   the lunar rover, the rule is that you can't drive any place where you can't walk back
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   from safely.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.040]   So if I got a drone it would be I'm not allowed to fly the drone anywhere where I couldn't
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.040]   walk out there, pick it up off the floor, and then take it back.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040]   And then you realize that it's just not going to turn...
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   I had this other drone that I will leave unnamed, but it kept on wanting to pull.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   Like you'd be flying it and suddenly we just kind of pull off one direction.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.040]   And I felt like it was kind of manageable, but one day I just pulled and it just went.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   It just disappeared and over the...
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.040]   Fortunately I was in the middle of nowhere.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.040]   But it just disappeared.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   I've never seen it again.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   It just went into the woods.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.040]   It just kept on...
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.040]   It just really banged.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040]   It's really bad feeling when that happens.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   It's just a...
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.040]   When it just goes over the railing of the boat.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   And it goes...
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   There's nothing...
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040]   It's gone.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   I had problem solved.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:11.040]   If it were hanging over the railing, I would have the opportunity to risk my life to get
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   it back, but now problem solved.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   I don't know if it could fix anything.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.880]   DJI used to have a thing you could automatically turn it off immediately if you just push the
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.280]   two controllers down and in.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.040]   And I was doing these acromatics with it.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040]   I think they still have that.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040]   I don't think it doesn't...
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.040]   But I think that now it doesn't do it while it'll land.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.040]   But in the earlier versions, I was doing acrobatics.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   I get into spin in a certain pace and turn.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   And somehow I got into that and it just dropped out of the sky 30 feet up.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.040]   I have to say, I don't feel as bad as the guy who designed Apple's Chicago store.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040]   Oh, God.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.040]   Well, it's a great store.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040]   I've been...
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   Do you think it was an architect in California?
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040]   See, here's the problem.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   See those giant icicles hanging off the lip of the store?
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.040]   That's awesome.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.040]   If you were to walk under and it were to fall off on your head.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   By the way, as you all know, who live in snowy climbs, icicles do fall off.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.040]   It would...
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.040]   It would kill you.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.160]   In fact, I think there's an agatha Christie or some sort of murder mystery where you kill
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.040]   the guy with an icicle because of murder weapon melts.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.040]   You just tell kids that there's snowballs and there's icicles.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   I mean, I was hit a big sport when I was a kid, was knocking on icicles down with snowballs.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040]   Yeah, Apple needs some kids with a snowball.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.040]   I think that's a great way.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.000]   We've all said that like there are too many people in line for the brand new
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   iPhone.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.840]   Now it's like how much skin are you willing to pull it in the game to be number one in
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.000]   line right at the door, like when a brand new device is great.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Exactly.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   There was another story.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   It took which one.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   There was a...
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.200]   Before we get off this though, Blair Cayman, who's the architecture credit for the Chicago
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:51.000]   Tribune across the river from us, actually did a really good post about it.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.960]   Basically, the Apple's official statement was that, yes, of course, they were going
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.080]   to be anticipated that it's going to be terrible winners in Chicago, that the roof actually
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.800]   has a heating system that will keep ice from actually forming and the water is supposed
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.000]   to go to special channels that are hidden inside pillars.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.560]   And this is all computer control.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560]   They just haven't dialed.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.360]   I guess they just didn't dial it incorrectly.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.360]   Oh.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.360]   So it's the answer.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.920]   It's not as bad as a mistake as it looks.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   Exactly.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920]   It means it's brand new building.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.360]   You're not going to figure it out until things are actually in play.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.760]   Also he makes a really good statement.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.200]   And again, if you go to Chicago Tribune.com, again, tip it hat to the folks across the
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200]   river.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.720]   He makes a really good point that this is what happens.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.960]   If you want to have really cool architecture, you have to occasionally, you're going to
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.920]   have not missteps, but you're going to have problems like this.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.960]   He mentions that in Millennium Park, there's this beautiful, like a Frank Gehry designed,
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.360]   I think, walkway that's all beautiful natural wood that they have to close down when it
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.920]   gets too cold and icy because if they put, if they sent like a snow throw over there,
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.400]   we'd like scrape the hell out of it.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.960]   But that means that the fact that doesn't mean that they fail to continue to consider
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.920]   winter in Chicago is because they want to have this beautiful wooden walkway.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.600]   And it's okay for them to have to shut it down occasionally when the weather is bad.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.360]   So I'm sure they'll fix it.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:16.840]   And the challenge of competing in an architectural city like Chicago, where you've got to bring
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840]   it.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.880]   You can't just say, "Oh, look, we made a square cube."
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   No, no, no.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880]   This is Chicago, man.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.360]   You've got to bring it with the architecture.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:28.160]   And so I'm sure that they'll have this problem solved very, very quickly.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.440]   And they'll be left with what is still a beautiful addition to the catalog of Chicago
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.440]   buildings.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.160]   I thought it was, it's the, I think it's the nicest Apple store I've walked into.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.120]   And I've been in a lot of Apple stores.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.120]   It's gorgeous.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.120]   It was just gorgeous.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120]   It was just gorgeous.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.120]   It was just unbelievable.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.120]   It just felt so good.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.120]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.120]   It's, it's great.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.120]   It's very powerful.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.720]   Remember the fifth Avenue Apple store?
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720]   It's all underground.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:57.480]   It's like you're in with the mall people, whereas this is like a plaza.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.480]   This is like a public space.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.960]   And it wouldn't take so far.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.280]   It's beautiful on the outside.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.120]   It's beautiful when you walk in, when you walk down, it's very inviting.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.240]   There's all places to sit.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.360]   The LED wall is the nicest LED wall I've ever, ever seen.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.240]   And I see a lot of LED walls.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.380]   And it's just, it's just, everything about it was, was really nice except for the hard
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.380]   drive selection.
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:19.380]   It's very anemic.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.200]   Who goes to Apple stores to buy hard drive?
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.200]   I just picture it.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.200]   I was nearby.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.360]   It was your buy job and I didn't have, we give you a tetrack.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   That's just a Chicago way.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.960]   That's why you build an Apple store.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.600]   It was the shortest drive and I needed it quickly.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.040]   We need, we need someone to redo like the, the, if I remember how like in the, in the fifth
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.840]   Avenue store, they went up having to, or designed to replace the panels because they found a
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.840]   better way of doing it.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.160]   So if they ever have to like replace the glass, I want somebody to recreate like the blues
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.200]   brothers, like arrival at Dilly Plaza where this drive through the glass.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.200]   Oh my God.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:56.640]   One side of another two donuts through the, that'd be awesome.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.840]   Here's a story that broke right before, right after we did our last Mac break weekly and
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:06.520]   left for the holidays and Mark Gurman in Bloomberg, he's still getting those rumors.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:13.440]   Apple plans combined iPhone, iPad and Mac apps to create one user experience.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.920]   This has been rumored for a long time that Apple was somehow merged Mac OS and iOS.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.640]   Now that I have an iMac pro, I hope they don't do that.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   This is not that though.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:25.080]   This is one of those stories where it's widely, well not misreported, but misinterpreted.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Okay.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.600]   So what's been happening for a while is a lot of developers got into making iOS apps because
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.000]   UI kit was more modern than app kit and it was much more approachable.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.320]   And many of those people have wanted Apple to sort of bring UI kit to the Mac platform
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:43.400]   because they find it so approachable and Apple's done some things like they did UX kit to bring
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.320]   photos.app over and it's not the best app, but it did show that there were some ways
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.000]   of starting to bridge that gap.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.560]   And this is called Marzipan, that's the code name that Mark talked about.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.480]   And it's not, it's not really a user experience so much as at least my understanding is even
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.160]   at the engineering level at Apple, they've brought the teams together so that the core
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.680]   of the apps are being worked on together because it's just more efficient that way.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:09.440]   They make them core for messages on iOS and Mac OS is built by the same team and then different
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.800]   teams do the interfaces that are appropriate.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.080]   And this is, this sounds like the same thing where they want to get it to a point where,
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.680]   let's say I get really into iOS engineering and I want to make a Mac app, I don't have
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:22.400]   to go and then learn this like a completely separate pipeline.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.240]   The frameworks are the same already, largely there's some similar frameworks, but they
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.360]   just want to make the process of making these apps more efficient at the core level.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:34.080]   So you'll have one sort of engine for your app and then you'll still have to build appropriate
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.640]   user interfaces for it to suit the platform.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.560]   The same way you would for an Apple TV version of the app, for example.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.440]   There is a move a foot and it's being supported right now by Google and Microsoft for something
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.840]   they call progressive web apps.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:55.440]   That sounds similar, Apple has kind of gone back and forth on maybe supporting it and
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:00.880]   Safari, what it is, is the idea that you can develop essentially what is a web page, completely
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:11.080]   cross platform HDMI 5 web page, but that computers, smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops,
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.440]   have service workers that are running and the browser supports this.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:20.880]   It will download the assets from the web page and the web page basically turns into a app
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.720]   that runs even offline on the platforms using the service workers.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.520]   And I think both Microsoft obviously likes this because they have this problem with the
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.880]   Microsoft store and so forth.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.680]   You live in a strange world where Microsoft has this problem.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.680]   Google wants it because of course that means Chrome OS and Android both could run these
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.680]   apps.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.160]   It seems like a very good technology.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.080]   I'm not an expert on it and I love to talk to developers.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.080]   Electron apps.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.200]   People like to hate electron apps on Slack.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.760]   Slack I believe is an electron and there's more and more of those.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.520]   And as always when it's easier for the developer it somehow never manages to be better.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.240]   The problem with Electron is you're basically downloading a tile Google Chrome as the engine
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.320]   for Sublime or Atom or I think it's Atom is running an Electron.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.480]   So you have these very, very heavy apps.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.080]   I don't think this is as heavy.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.320]   I think this is more of a develop once and propagate to everything.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.320]   Exactly.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.320]   I don't think it has to be like a web.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.320]   It's kind of web apps.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.000]   It's web apps on steroids though.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.520]   It's what Apple originally proposed.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.280]   I think it's going to be still a native app that does all the good stuff.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280]   It's not about a native.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.280]   It's HTML.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.560]   I don't even think it's going to be.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:33.600]   But I think the interesting thing about that is that it also sets the stage for Apple to
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.440]   finally make some of their hardware touch screen because this interface has to get involved.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:44.400]   I'd love Apple to adopt it but it sounds like this is a competing or a different technology
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   to accomplish this.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   It's just native.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.000]   I see it as completely different solutions.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.880]   I think that the solutions you're talking about that Google and Microsoft are looking
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.560]   at Microsoft isn't looking at that as a replacement for their desktop strategy but simply as a
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.160]   way to sort of enhance what they've got.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.320]   Remember this not just Windows.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.680]   They really do have that Windows everywhere mentality that they've got an app or a server.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.520]   They can write one app that runs in an iPad and Windows.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:12.920]   Well, but they also have the firepower to have people who are writing for better or worse
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.520]   a real desktop app for their purposes.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.880]   For Google, it's to their point to make sure that everything can be run within a browser
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.560]   because that is their business.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:28.460]   The third factor there is that you've got the majority, I think, of development talent
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.040]   out there that is learning.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.440]   There aren't really sort of like green thumb developers if that makes sense.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.160]   These are people who learn how to write stuff.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.520]   Here's how to use a framework and here's how to customize that framework in JavaScript.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:47.080]   So it allows you to sort of take this pool of talent that is very results oriented as
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.120]   opposed to let's push the technology forward oriented and allows them to become a lot more
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.960]   powerful and a lot more useful.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.520]   As far as Marzipan goes, I had two reactions to it.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.200]   One of which is that, well, that certainly makes sense given that the core functionality
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.480]   of so many apps is shared between iOS and macOS.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.800]   So that's certainly a natural thing, all the stuff that Renee was saying about how developers
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.460]   wish that a lot of elements of the Mac experience could be created as flexibly and as wonderfully
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.680]   as the tools that they use for iOS.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.000]   That's absolutely a very good point.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.280]   So a lot of this is really great news.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:30.280]   I got to say that after 2017, I still think that Apple has yet to demonstrate, really
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:36.200]   demonstrate that they have a lot of excitement internally about the Mac's future.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:43.240]   They really have to prove by having a demo during WWDC of new features in the macOS that
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.920]   is not just, hey, look at this iOS like feature we added to mail.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:52.840]   So in the back of my mind, I have to wonder, is this a way for them to sort of subtly pivot
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:59.720]   the nature of development from, hey, write an iOS app and after you've written your wonderful
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.880]   iOS app, it'll be so easy to turn it into a wonderful macOS app as well.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.560]   Or to make sure that if we imagine that there's already a date circled on a calendar five
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.880]   years hands from when they're going to announce they're going to drop macOS for good.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.400]   Imagine a date in two or three years where they can say, look how we, hey, all you Mac
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.480]   developers, guess what?
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.400]   You now know how to write a really great iOS app and we're going to teach you how to turn
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.000]   those skills from this dead end thing that we only use for machine learning and for iOS
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.800]   development platform and use it to make money off the iOS app store.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.520]   So again, I'm not saying that this is absolute, this is what's happening.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.960]   I'm saying that 2017 really underscored for me that Apple has yet to really demonstrate
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.240]   that they are committed as something other than a platform for developing iOS apps as
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.960]   something other than a something for running huge CPUs that they can't put into an iOS
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:54.960]   device.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.200]   They have yet to demonstrate at this point that they're committed to the Mac as its own
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.760]   platform as its own destiny as an important part of computing in general.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.440]   And until they've, should they played that hand until they've had that dog and pony
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:10.880]   show, I think that that I have to take this news and wonder what the ramifications would
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.800]   be if they have planned to dump macOS at some point in the future.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.920]   I hope that's not the case.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.600]   I think that Apple's, I mean, my, you know, from the outside, it seems that Apple views
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:25.040]   it as if you're doing anything that's not GPU or CPU intensive, you probably should be
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   using an iPad.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.720]   You know, like, and I don't say I agree with that, but I'm saying that I think that, you
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.400]   know, because I am still, I feel like I'm just too old.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.760]   I can't do a lot of things.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.240]   I mean, there's a lot of simple things that I just like to use my laptop for.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.600]   And my kids don't know what to do with the keyboard.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:44.680]   I mean, like they use it occasionally, but they're much more facile with the iPad than
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]   I am.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680]   I don't know.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.680]   I mean, it's, I don't know what the future holds.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.680]   It's interesting.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.880]   And remember that this is completely in flux at this point.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:00.160]   This is just an idea that they're certainly moving forward, but they have, I don't, I
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:04.640]   don't think that even internally Apple knows exactly what they're doing with this.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.040]   And by the time we see this at WWDC this year or even next year, that's when we'll see
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.520]   exactly what they intend for this.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.880]   For now, I do think that it's a way of making sure that whatever you learn either on the
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.320]   Mac, excuse me, as a developer for either the Mac or the iOS, you'll be able to take
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.360]   that and translate it elsewhere.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.960]   You don't have to write the same code base several times.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.720]   But again, I do have that, I do have that, that little extra.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.960]   There's a reason why we keep a spare tire and road flares in the trunk of the car at
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.920]   all times because we know that mankind is born to trouble just as early as the sparks
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:36.920]   fly upward.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:42.560]   And I think a large portion of the, of users do, you know, could, if, you know, have either,
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.000]   you know, could have something that just didn't have a lot more to it.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.360]   That maybe had the form factor of a Mac, but really ran more on iOS.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.200]   I mean, there's a lot of people that I know that aren't, that aren't using the computers
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.200]   very hard.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.240]   I mean, they're checking their email, they're doing a couple of other things there.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.280]   You know, and there's nothing about what they're doing that would require a Mac Mac, you know,
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:04.080]   or Mac apps that, you know, that, that just don't use it that way.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.720]   And I think that there is a huge draw for Apple to get away from having that issue where,
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.720]   you know, what if you had a completely sandboxed environment?
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   It's safe.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:18.520]   It's, you know, tried and, you know, you have much lower chance of it's very secure.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:22.600]   Like, all of those things are, are beneficial to the average consumer that just wants to
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.360]   use their computer to check email and surf the web and, and do a couple of little things.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:32.280]   And so I think that that is a, is, is maybe where there is a version of the Mac that, that
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.400]   lives out there that becomes more of an iOS thing.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.560]   And then there's people like us that, some of us that want to customize it and we still
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.920]   use the Mac or, or we want to use it hard, like what, what I do, which is, you know,
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.960]   CPU and GPU intensive processes.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.960]   I went on this vacation.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.200]   I didn't take a Mac with me.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.200]   I only took my iPad.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   How'd I go for you?
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.200]   It was great.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.200]   I tried that.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.560]   It was very light, but I was, I wasn't doing a lot of work.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:58.560]   There's one thing also to remember all this is that Apple is a huge iOS and Mac developer
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.640]   and they will often solve pain points for themselves that end up benefiting other huge
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]   iOS and Mac developers.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.200]   And if it makes apples light, like right now you look at messages where two versions
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:11.240]   later still won't show message effects and having to be like the increasingly we have
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.560]   features that we want on both platforms and they're just not showing up, primarily not
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560]   showing up on the Mac.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:19.040]   And if it makes it easier to make, to keep the platforms in lockstep where it makes
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.120]   sense like things like I message showing me the bubble effects that I want to see, I'm
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.280]   all for this sort of thing.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:33.000]   Do you think, I think we've said this before that we'll know when this time is coming that
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.360]   the Mac OS is going away, when you can develop apps on iOS fully.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.240]   Yeah, that'll be a big sign.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:47.200]   They have to have when they, when Apple gives you an alternative to Xcode on the Mac, then
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.720]   that's when we know that the time is now when Apple releases Xcode for Windows, that's
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.360]   when okay, time to not buy anymore Macs.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.920]   Well, that would be there is that way.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:57.920]   They're really depressing.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.320]   Like, and you want to develop an app right in on Windows.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.320]   Oof.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.320]   It's also possible that I like, you know, that there'll be a third thing that comes along
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.400]   like the same way next, obliviated the previous Apple thought there could be something that
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.720]   happens that sort of takes over and is more is more intelligent and more diverse and understands
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.200]   context and replaces both iOS and Mac OS for Apple.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.760]   You don't need to write software anymore.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.600]   It'll write itself for you.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.400]   Leo, automation is taking over everything.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.600]   There's going to be just AR versions of us sitting around here in 30 years in the exact
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.600]   same show.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.600]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:28.600]   Yes.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.600]   30 years.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.600]   Yes.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.680]   Tim Cook doing okay.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.320]   He's not as well as Angela Aron's.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.520]   Angela made even more money, but they had a promise her a lot of money to leave her CEO
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.080]   job at Burberry.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080]   Tim.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.440]   So Angela, what does Angela's pay date to?
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:53.440]   She, she got, they got $24.2 million each.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.240]   Angela, Luca Main Street, Johnny Sruggi.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.800]   She got a commission right on everything sold.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.280]   Oh, does she get a commission?
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   Everything sold?
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.480]   That would be good.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.040]   Bruce Sewell, $24 million each.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.520]   Tim Cook got $9.3 million in incentive pay.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520]   This is for 27.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.320]   He's no longer allowed to fly on a public airline.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.200]   Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Cook.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.920]   I know you love United Airlines.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.920]   I know you do.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.000]   But these operation guys are often like they still drive that 10 year old Camry.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   I mean, I don't blame them.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000]   Where's the month of their plan?
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:32.680]   $3 million in salary and equity award, which means they gave him $89.2 million in stock.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:35.800]   So Tim Cook's total pay out $102 million.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800]   He's giving it all away.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.040]   He's giving it all away because he, you know, he's that kind of guy.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.280]   Tim Cook's travel costs in 2017, a mere $93,000.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.520]   He's a piker compared to the Trump cabinet.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.600]   He should really get out there and start spending for a lot of the executives.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.640]   For a lot of executives, if it comes down to their time, you know, so they don't like
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:01.000]   to travel a lot because I have no problem with Tim Cook flying private jets.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.800]   No, but I mean, a lot of them won't even, even if it's private jets.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:04.800]   They don't want to fly.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.240]   We do a lot of, not for Apple, but we do a lot of point to points where we take a very
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.480]   high level CEO or high level officer and put them somewhere else in the world to be like
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.280]   on a big screen in front of lots of people.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.680]   And that's becoming more and more popular because they don't want to go anywhere.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.480]   They don't want to go anywhere because that's, you know, it's three days and it's time shifts
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:25.120]   and it's them, you know, being less than efficient, especially when you're paying someone $10
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.840]   million a year or $5 million a year every day costs you X amount of dollars to have them
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.840]   out.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:38.600]   And the cost of their flight is nothing compared to the cost of their, of their effective execution.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.480]   Tim's security costs, it's almost a quarter of a million dollars.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.520]   So that is a quarter of a million dollars.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.520]   That's not much.
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.520]   Is it?
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:48.520]   That's like three guys.
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:49.520]   Nothing.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.520]   Nothing.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.520]   Nothing.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.680]   Like I don't even know how you guys, I don't even know how you can do an event for a one
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.240]   big guy, one little guy.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.640]   I work on events where the security cost is higher than that.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   I mean, I like that's, you know, to do that for a whole year.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.800]   That's that is they call this incremental security cost incremental.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.040]   So that's over and above what they normally do.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.440]   So that means extra people when he arrives because the Apple security probably has staff
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.080]   that is sure is showing up.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080]   They have a full time.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.400]   But yeah, 224,000 is nothing.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.960]   They got Apple, Popo.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:16.960]   They got Apple jail.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:17.960]   They got Apple everything.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:18.960]   Chase cars.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:20.960]   They got it all.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:21.960]   Hell of carriers.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:22.960]   Security guys.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.680]   Security guys that work for these corporations is not nothing to mess with.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   I'm with the Apple.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.680]   Beautiful aluminum.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.680]   I'm with the Apple.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:30.680]   Beautiful aluminum.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.960]   Iphone had a very good holiday season.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.840]   The best selling tech product of 2017 according to USA Today.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:40.760]   That includes iPhone 10s and 8s.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:45.240]   Although the it's pretty clear the iPhone 10 outsold the eight, at least in terms of
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.400]   product activations.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:51.320]   30% of US iPhone sales during the first 30 days of availability.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.800]   iPhone 8 and 8 plus made 40% of the sales in that period.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.800]   So it's confusing.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.800]   I'm getting confusing.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.800]   Conflicting data.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.320]   They do that on I believe they do that on purpose so that they can tell their clients
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:04.040]   to buy sell based on what they think the media responsible be.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.000]   And they make a fortune.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.440]   We did see a story that was quickly debunked that Apple was slowing down production of
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.840]   the iPhone 10 because it wasn't selling well.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.240]   Yeah, that's because they want to be able to short before the story got a lot of attention.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.480]   I am getting so jaded with all of this financial coverage because it just seems so manipulative.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480]   You know what surprised me?
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:28.760]   I did see one story that said that worldwide the activations for the Google Pixel 2 XL
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.040]   handily beat out every other phone, which really surprised me giving the...
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.880]   I thought that they said the same thing about iOS.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.880]   I know it's very...
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.080]   iOS activations were some kind of...
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.680]   I think that's in US alone.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.240]   US activations.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.760]   So yeah, you got to compare global with US.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.120]   Apple tops device activations during holidays.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.080]   iPhone 10, handily beating iPhone 8 and 8 plus.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.600]   This is I think US only.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.080]   This is from Flurry Analytics.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.240]   Apple and Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Motorola, LG, Oppo and Vivo.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240]   And this...
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.000]   Any of the companies will report actual results soon enough so we don't have to get it.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   Yeah, this is...
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   Actually, no, this is global.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.320]   Oh, it's so confusing.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.320]   I don't know.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.560]   They're all doing well.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560]   They're all making more money than...
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.120]   Hey, everybody's doing just fine.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.760]   It was a good holiday.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.200]   Except unless you're serious.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.880]   So I'm sorry, Pixel 2 XL did well in the United States, was number one in the United
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.680]   States, globally, Apple did best.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.040]   So that's very strange.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:34.040]   But again, it just depends on which analyst you're following and where his stock sits.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:41.920]   An Italian company calls itself Steve Jobs and Apple can't do anything about it.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.760]   Love that logo.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.760]   Do you like the Steve...
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.080]   Those are the ugliest logo I've ever seen.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:50.080]   It's got an apple in it though, but Steve Jobs jeans.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.000]   The most hysterical thing is that they had a harder time defending the logo than Steve
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   Jobs.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.840]   It was just as simple as, "Oh, well, they didn't trademark it.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840]   It's just a name."
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.840]   Great.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.840]   That's good.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.440]   But hey, that right leading leaf on the top of your logo, let's talk about that.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.280]   That is the ugliest logo I have ever seen.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:13.720]   Vincenzo and Giacomo Barbato have successfully managed to win a legal battle against Apple,
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.440]   earning the right to call their company Steve Jobs according to La Rapublika Napoli.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:25.200]   Since 2012, the brothers have been...
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.560]   Notice Apple never trademarked Jobs' names and they were making clothing and accessory
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.800]   company and they thought, "Well, wouldn't it be cool?"
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:35.400]   "It would be great if we called it as Steve Jobs."
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.520]   And of course, Apple immediately said, "No, you can't."
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.560]   Magni, if you can't.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:44.480]   So they're going to continue to make Steve Jobs jeans.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.400]   Well, the letter J is not edible.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.960]   Clearly, it's not edible.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.040]   I think that they probably lost.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.280]   I think that their business plan must have been we will take it.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.080]   It will go so far that at some point, Apple obviously will pay us millions to change the
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.080]   name.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.880]   And now, damn it, now they have to make bad pants.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.880]   Because...
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:03.880]   Oh, what are we going to do?
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:04.880]   We want to get their legal fees back.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.880]   Oh my God.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.360]   I love that story.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.600]   Those are going to be collector's items, kids.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.600]   Snap those up.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.600]   I don't.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.400]   I want to build my own Lisa computer.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.480]   And actually, I want to get Bill Atkinson on to talk about this.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.480]   Raspberry Pi.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.840]   Oh, he could build you one.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.200]   Can you imagine how freaky it would be to have...
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.280]   Lisa running on a Raspberry Pi.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:38.760]   On a $10,000 failure Lisa computer running on a $5 Raspberry Pi.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.760]   That's what I want.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.880]   It was not for the $68,000.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.040]   I think it probably would run just fine on a Raspberry Pi.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.640]   It would run faster than the original.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.640]   Chinese come.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.640]   It would be snappy.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.640]   It should.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:56.560]   So the reason this comes up is because the source code for the Lisa OS will be manned
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.200]   available sometime this year.
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.880]   This is according to the Computer History Museum.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.440]   I don't know where they must have gotten it from Apple, right?
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:04.680]   I mean, it's protected.
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.680]   Apple has to...
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.760]   Apple's vetting it right now for...
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   Can they do this?
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.480]   You're taking bad words out of the comments.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:17.560]   There was a whole tangent, but Don Melton told me before he got the job making Safari at
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.920]   Apple, his job was to help open source Mozilla for...
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.320]   Sorry, open source Firefox, the Mozilla engine for Netscape, and his job was to take all
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.760]   the curse words out of the code because they use curse words as line breaks.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.760]   And he got the job because out of coming after a seminary school, he knew the most curse words.
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.040]   So he was a natural fit.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.040]   That is true, really.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.560]   That a lot of the vetting for this stuff is not the code.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.280]   It's the comments.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.880]   And the partner references that you put in there on the frustration that...
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.960]   Well, and also one thing you do have to watch out for is libraries, copyright libraries,
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.360]   libraries that don't have licenses for things like that.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.840]   Did Atkinson, I can't remember.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.240]   Did he work on the Lisa or no?
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.920]   I'll have to ask him.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.240]   Quick time is part of that, isn't it?
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:00.240]   I think so.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.240]   Kind of.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.360]   If that's the case, then I will make a promise to you that sometimes this year, when the
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.400]   source code comes out, we will have Bill Atkinson come in.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.440]   Because he wants to come in anyway to talk about the new version of the PhotoCard stuff.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.440]   He's great.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.520]   We've done some really good triangulations with him.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.320]   He's a wonderful, sweet guy.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.200]   And talk us through the source code.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.200]   Wouldn't that be a...
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.200]   Awesome.
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.200]   24-hour special.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   Director's commentary.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.200]   I'm there.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.200]   Absolutely.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.800]   The director's commentary of the Lisa source code.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.560]   He's so great.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.240]   So if you play that card, make sure you come back for HyperCard.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.120]   That is the one piece of software where even beyond the Mac and D-Rational Mac and talk
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.120]   about Spring Scratch.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.920]   I want to hear the story from start to finish every line of code, every detail.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:59.520]   I mean, at some point, I hope that Apple will decide to make a Mac OS or Mac system 6.02
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:00.520]   open.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:05.160]   Just so you can create a HyperCard machine that is just...
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.960]   I know there are emulators out there, but I just want a HyperCard focused operating
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:20.080]   system so that we can make a touchscreen-based HyperCard runtime so that these $5, $10, $30
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.080]   computers can just run beautiful HyperCard stacks everywhere.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.080]   It's...
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.800]   What you can do with Python is wonderful.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.040]   What you can do with all these different frameworks that are touchscreen, graphic frameworks for
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.720]   Python is wonderful, but nothing will ever approach the simplicity and the beauty and
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:41.320]   the creativity of HyperCard and HyperTalk.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   That's a great one.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.320]   I love that idea.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.880]   I programmed a whole radio station with HyperCard.
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:45.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:46.880]   I mean, it was just like...
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:47.880]   It wasn't like one of those things.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.600]   I just kind of started piecing stuff together and before you know what, I've got the whole
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.000]   thing and I've got these rotations and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000]   Bill has...
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.400]   I got a nice email for the holidays from Bill.
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.400]   He's doing great, by the way.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.640]   His wife passed, as you probably know last year, but he's doing really well.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.320]   He sent me a picture of all his license plates.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.600]   He's driving to Tesla now, but he had a license plate.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.800]   I'm trying to find it with the word HyperCard on it.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.960]   He did have a HyperCard.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.360]   He also had a graph bits and...
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.440]   I don't know if quick time was later.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.680]   Quick draw might have been in the Lisa.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.680]   I think that sounds...
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.680]   Quick draw.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:29.680]   I'm trying to figure out whether it was an extension of the work that was done in the
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.920]   Lisa for the Mac.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.960]   I know that it's Bill Atkinson's start to finish.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.960]   I don't know whether...
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:37.040]   Lisa graph was there...
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.600]   Well, that was in the Lisa.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.600]   I don't know.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.240]   That was an app, wasn't it?
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.840]   Was it the graphics library?
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:52.360]   According to Wikipedia, Quick Draw was grounded in Apple Lisa's Lisa graph.
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.880]   The code will probably be in...
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:01.000]   Bill was the principal designer and developer of the graphical user interface of the Lisa.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.720]   We got to get him on.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720]   Carsten...
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720]   Good.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:12.560]   We'll have him on sooner if he wants to come on sooner, but that's huge.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.320]   That would be really fun just to go through the source code.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.320]   Really?
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.320]   Bill Atkinson is to...
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.320]   Scott.
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.320]   Software development.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.920]   He's like having Jack Kirby or Stan Leon.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.600]   It's not just his mind, not just his imagination, but his knowledge of history and the people
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.800]   he was talking with on a daily basis.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.200]   It's the more time that I would like...
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.680]   If I were rich, I would just be paying him like...
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.560]   Every minute you spend Bill in front of a microphone, I will cut you a check for $5,000.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560]   You don't have to.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.480]   You had him in to do a one-hour triangulation five hours later, we were still going.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.480]   That's awesome.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:50.920]   He's a wonderful guy and we had so much fun with him.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.200]   Go back and look at those triangulations.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:57.640]   He did indicate he wants to come back.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640]   We will figure that out.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.880]   I wouldn't mind doing both Hypercard and Lisa.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:02.880]   Absolutely.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.560]   The Hypercard source is not available, is it?
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.560]   No.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.120]   No, it's great to have him just come and just talk about it.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.280]   Well, we've done that.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   We've done a lot of that.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280]   Just Hypercard?
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.280]   We talked a lot about the Hypercard.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.280]   It feels like it.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.280]   I don't know.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.280]   All the cards.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.920]   All the cards.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.080]   Are you going to buy this?
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.440]   I might buy this for my iMac Pro.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.440]   No.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.440]   I don't take it anywhere.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.280]   The reason I have it on my desk is because it doesn't go anywhere.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.600]   Carson, did you find this on Amazon?
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.360]   The LaVolta carrying case bag for Apple iMac 27 in Chan May, genuine leather and wool
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.360]   felt.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.880]   How else are you going to take it to Starbucks with the Elio?
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.560]   Look at that guy's carrying it down the street.
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.560]   You need that.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:47.560]   I mean, I don't understand why people are making it.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:52.000]   You can't just load it over only the people who managed to come to your office.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.400]   You need the appropriation of strangers saying, "Oh my God, is that the new iMac?"
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.200]   And you're as a space gray, so it'll even better match.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.040]   They'll really look good in that case.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.720]   Only $75.99 sold by SmartPants.us.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.360]   I think Steve Jobs is the Italian distributor.
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.360]   I don't know.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.360]   Steve Jobs.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.360]   Steve Jobs.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:14.960]   I don't know what to do with that.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:15.960]   You need it.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.960]   I don't need it.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.760]   There are very few things that we talk about on the show that I don't go, "I need that."
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.120]   This is one of the ones that I do not need.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:25.800]   That's my pick of the week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.040]   What's yours, Alex Lindsey?
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.040]   Mine is...
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.400]   So I brought it with him.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.320]   No, no, I just have it on the app.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.240]   So have you used Vibino?
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.240]   Vibino?
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.080]   Yes, I have.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.080]   I love Vibino.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:40.080]   It works so well.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.800]   So it makes me make me like an expert.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.600]   You can take pictures of...
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   You take pictures of wine bottles.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.400]   I was like, "I don't know if this is really going to work or not."
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.880]   So I was in the Whole Foods and...
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.400]   That's not the barcode, the actual label.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.480]   You just take a picture of the label.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.840]   And I just was kind of amazed that it worked every single time.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:56.840]   Then I took a picture of a label.
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.480]   Now I'm walking around and I don't know whether I should or I shouldn't, whether it's good.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.640]   You know, whatever, but I still do it.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.760]   I sit there and I just take pictures of all the labels to make a decision because I don't
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:05.920]   know what wine to get.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.240]   I mean, I know what whiskey to get, but I don't know what wine to get.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:16.120]   And so I get some good wine for the house.
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.800]   And so I started taking pictures of these and it just worked so well.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.600]   And I got some amazing, amazing wines that I would not have bought otherwise.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.080]   I didn't recognize the label.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.560]   It's a really nice app.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.320]   And it works very well.
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:38.920]   As I do with Parasam, P-R-S-O-M-M, it's a Samoye's wine recommendation app.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.560]   So now that you know what wine you're looking at, you can look at Parasam and they recommend
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.720]   pairings and so forth.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:51.840]   And then when you get a, I know all of these, when you get your own seller, then you need
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:52.840]   corks.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:56.440]   That's going to be your database.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:01.080]   Corks lets you put all your wines in the database.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:06.040]   And then when you drink, it'll say when it's time to drink it like, oh, it's getting old,
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.360]   it's time to drink it.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.560]   Or when you do drink it, you could take it out of your database.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.360]   So combine the three of those.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.600]   You know, you never use, that's it.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.800]   Take everything else off your iPhone and stay drunk.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.800]   That's it.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.360]   That's all you need.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:23.360]   That's good.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.360]   I have a whole wine folder.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.360]   I'll give you a second.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360]   Yes.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360]   I'm going to give you a folder.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360]   I don't know.
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.040]   The funny thing is I'm very rarely drink wine, but I'm ready when I decide to.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:35.560]   When I grow up, I'm going to be a wine drinker.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560]   What do you drink now?
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.560]   Zavino.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.560]   I know I water.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:39.560]   I love water.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.560]   There you go.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.560]   Coffee.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.560]   Lot of coffee.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:43.560]   I drink tea.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.560]   Not the soda pop.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.720]   I noticed that they now have bulletproof coffee in a little box at Whole Foods.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.720]   In a box?
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.040]   Like, you know, you could take it to go.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.040]   That's the coffee with butter in it.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.040]   Like a sippy cup?
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.040]   It's so good.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.160]   If I'd drink it, I'd still drink coffee in mass amounts.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.760]   I wouldn't drink it, but I just drink butter and some other thing in it that makes you
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.760]   smart.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.760]   Pg tips.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.760]   Pg tips.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.760]   We got it.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.760]   Just for you.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.760]   Coffee.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.200]   You're pick of the week, Mr. Andy, in a hot go?
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.160]   Mine is an oldie, but now a goodie.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.320]   This is a new version of Firefox that came out a couple months ago, a code named Firefox
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.320]   Quantum.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:23.120]   Firefox has been in the deep, deep background for a couple of years as the one that the
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:29.800]   boy brothers got beaten by not just Chrome, but got beaten by whatever it was that Chrome
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.400]   beat and has become kind of irrelevant.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:38.160]   This one, I downloaded it a couple months ago and I decided I gave it my usual test for
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.440]   any web browser.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:40.600]   That's not my daily driver.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:46.640]   I simply kept it running alongside Chrome, which is my daily driver up a browser.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.920]   And if I find myself tabbing over to Firefox instead of Chrome, that means that it's a
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.760]   really good thing.
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.560]   And I've been finding I've been using Firefox almost 50/50 with Chrome these days.
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:02.360]   And because it's just so much faster than anything else I've got available for me on
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.160]   the Mac, they did a really big rewrite of it.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.000]   It has a lot better security, a lot better privacy.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.840]   It is very, very modern, but it also has a brand new rendering engine that's not only
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:21.240]   hugely standards compliant, but it makes really good use of multiple cores in a CPU.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:28.920]   So it is so much faster having my usual laziness is that I tend to open tabs and not close
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:29.920]   them.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.280]   And at the end of the day, especially if I'm researching something, I can have 40, 50,
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.280]   60 tabs.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:38.200]   And this is why I have to restart Chrome every once in a while.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.880]   But it's like a week and a half, two weeks later.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.800]   And only then do I realize that I've got so many windows across so many screens in Firefox,
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:48.840]   and it's just not slowing down at all.
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:53.600]   So I haven't switched completely to this new Firefox, but I'm really impressed with it.
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:52:00.200]   It's gone from something that I hadn't even installed or kept on previous iterations of
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:06.480]   my Macs to something that might actually displace Chrome sooner or later, unless the new version
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.960]   of Chrome doesn't become just as fast and just as stable as this new Firefox.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:17.000]   And in principle, I like the fact that it is a fully open source app, whereas parts of
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.120]   Chrome are open source parts of things.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.400]   I think parts of Safari are still open source.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.200]   But this is a community owned, it belongs to everybody sort of thing.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.400]   And it means that no matter what platform I have, I can definitely make sure that I can
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.040]   get a version of it for that platform, including all the different flavors of Linux that I'm
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:34.040]   using.
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:37.480]   So definitely worth checking out as with everything else, it's completely free.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:43.320]   So definitely, I do think that it's been a couple of years since it's been a very good
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:49.000]   idea to have multiple browsers on your desktop for different uses.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.560]   I still have Safari, I have the Tor browser, and they're set to different levels of inconvenience
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:57.000]   for my own good.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.360]   Safari, I've got JavaScript completely turned off.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.840]   It's the most locked down.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.840]   >> Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840]   >> That's a good idea.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.840]   >> Right.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.960]   So if there's something where I want to make sure that I've got something the least taxing
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.560]   thing, I don't have to change my settings in Chrome.
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:13.560]   I simply tap over to simply run something in Safari.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.160]   But it's really, Firefox is, I think, has definitely earned a place in the gun belt
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.080]   of the web browsers on your machine.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:25.800]   And it might even be a good choice as your weapon of choice, your primary browser.
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:26.800]   Definitely check it out.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.800]   >> I find.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.800]   >> Mozilla.org for it.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:31.880]   >> I find Firefox very good for watching Steeler games.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.520]   >> Because here's why.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.520]   Here's why.
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:39.720]   Because is it game pass on NFL doesn't work in the United States.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:44.000]   You have to wait until the end of the game, until they start letting you watch it, which
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.600]   is super annoying.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:53.640]   And so if you get Vanish IP and VPN to Delhi, India, and make sure that you don't have any
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:57.760]   cookies in your browser, you can watch Steeler game live.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.920]   And so it doesn't work in Europe, by the way.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.360]   Like if you'd say, "Oh, I want to do a VPN to London and it'll block half the thing."
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:08.200]   So the Vanish IP is really cool, by the way.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:11.440]   But I use Firefox because I don't use it for anything else.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:14.880]   And so it's easy for me to just blow away the cookies every time I use it.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:15.880]   So it's my Steeler.
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:17.800]   It's the season that's been my Steeler thing.
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.040]   And now that I've said this on the show, it'll never work again.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.040]   >> I gotcha, Lindsey.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:27.080]   >> I think it's a clever idea to have, because most of us have two or three browsers.
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.760]   And on Mac, you have Safari, Chrome, and often Firefox.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:30.760]   >> Right.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.000]   >> To have different settings, Andy.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000]   I like that idea.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000]   >> It's a great idea.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000]   >> And so if I need a secure one, is it true that Safari is the fastest and lightest
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.920]   weight on Mac OS?
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:44.360]   >> The day when they announce a browser, it is the fastest and lightest weight.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:47.320]   And then someone else makes their announcement, and then you make your announcement, and then
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:48.320]   they make their announcement.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:51.720]   >> But there are no joke, but all these browsers anymore, they're all good.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.440]   >> But also remember that you do have to, of course Firefox will be the fastest browser
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.600]   in your desktop, because you've only got three tabs on it.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.560]   You've got no settings, and you've got nothing.
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.560]   It's only after like two or three weeks when I was using it kind of 50% alongside Chrome
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.560]   that I realized that I'm rocking and rolling this as hard as I use any other browser.
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.000]   And it's still faster than anything else that I've been using.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.160]   So I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.440]   >> I like Safari just because it has the lowest battery impact still, and I'm always on the
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.440]   MacBook.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.440]   >> Yes, right.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.920]   If you're on portable, that's for sure the way they go.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.520]   I have a couple of questions for you guys.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.000]   So I'm setting up the new iMac Pro.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.280]   I've been doing that throughout the show.
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.280]   It's nice.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:31.280]   It feels good.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:34.280]   It's fast, it's fluid.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:37.200]   Which package manager do you guys like?
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:41.840]   There are a number of different ways to install Unix-style packages on the Mac.
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.960]   I've been using homebrew.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.600]   You guys still think homebrew is the one?
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:46.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.440]   I've never found a need to try anything else.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.000]   So I've looked at a couple others, but I've never seen a feature that I understood.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.320]   I've never been able to answer the question, what will another package manager do that
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:59.040]   homebrew will not do for me?
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.240]   >> So that's your recommendation.
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:05.320]   Because I have to install eMacs and a few of my Unix tools.
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:07.720]   >> And I like home brews and nice easy to use package manager.
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:11.560]   >> Not only that, but if you're doing work with video and transcoding and like ripping
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.320]   DVDs, you can either to make to make sure.
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.320]   >> Exactly.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:22.440]   To make handbrake work as something other than a way to convert free videos to something
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.280]   else, it's so much command line stuff.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.760]   It's so much installation, so many settings.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.280]   Or you take a couple of steps to install homebrew and then install, and then use homebrew
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:33.800]   to install everything you need.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.360]   And suddenly, the suddenly handbrake is just this amazing monster device.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:39.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:42.840]   No, I completely agree with you on that.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:46.360]   And then I'll show you my pick, but I'm curious what you guys think.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.040]   Now, Andy, you've talked in the past about, I think, Scrivener.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.800]   Writers have tools that they like to use.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:54.520]   We've talked a lot about Ulysses.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:59.760]   Scrivener in particular is designed so that you can have research notes at the same time
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.400]   as your writing.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.920]   And I've been looking for a tool that will let me keep track of things, take notes during
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.480]   meetings, phone calls.
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:11.160]   But more importantly, during my travels, keep track of all the documents I need and all
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.160]   that.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.520]   And I went back to a Mac classic.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:17.160]   I'm curious what you guys think about Devynthink.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.200]   This is not a cheap tool.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.200]   The most expensive version Pro Office is $150.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.320]   But I mean, it's a power tool.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:28.520]   It has a really nice, and I was recommending this on iOS today, by the way, a really nice
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.640]   iOS side app, Devynthink to Go, which gives you access on your iPad and iPhone to all
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:37.080]   of your Devynthink notes.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.240]   It's very ugly in the sense it's very engineering.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.720]   It looks like, I don't know, it's hard to describe.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.720]   It's not attractive.
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:47.200]   And yet it's a power tool.
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.280]   And I find it very useful.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:54.120]   I'm just curious what you guys think of that tool, particularly, or if you've used it even.
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:55.880]   It's been around for as long as it's been mass.
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:56.880]   You know, I've played with it.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:00.360]   I think it's been given a couple of years in old Mac worlds.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.000]   And so I'd install it and I'd play with it.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.920]   And I think at the time I couldn't, I didn't have enough need for it.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:06.560]   So I just kind of moved on.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.360]   But now I'm going to go look at it.
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:09.840]   Because I definitely need something like this.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.840]   I just don't know.
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.840]   Yeah, for like a project.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:16.040]   And it works with omnigroup stuff, but it's not omnigroup stuff.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:20.440]   It's hard to describe lawyers like it, doctors, journalists, writers.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:23.200]   Andy, you use Scrivener for your writing?
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:29.400]   I still use Scrivener as the project I'm working on that I can't talk about right now is classic
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.400]   case in point.
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.400]   I just had an idea that is I just wanted to play with because it was interesting enough.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:38.440]   And it's not even really a book yet.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:43.080]   But it's just a place where every time I have an idea about what this story should be or
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:47.360]   what this character should be like, or what this page should look like, I just jot it
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:48.360]   down in a note.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:50.200]   And there's always some place I can put it.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:56.080]   And now that you have a pile of different ideas in Scrivener, then the organization of them
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:57.880]   starts to suggest themselves.
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:01.680]   And once you start to see one piece of information relating to another piece of information,
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.360]   now you idea, oh, these two characters should definitely meet.
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:10.480]   Or remember this problem I had with how do we resolve this really weird situation in
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.800]   this world I'm creating?
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.840]   How would that effect be?
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.760]   And then suddenly you actually, if we put that there, then suddenly this is how it gets
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:18.760]   resolved.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.640]   And it's a complicated.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:24.040]   In a column, I basically, when I'm running a column, I have the entire idea in my head
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.560]   and I can just sort of, I know what the first sentence is, I can just start with that first
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.240]   sentence and get to the end of it.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:32.800]   But something like that, you really do just need to put something on a, everything on
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:38.880]   a big table and start to mentally, it's like in those crime stories, just connect with bits
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:43.160]   of red thread to see how things connect together before you see the entire picture in front
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.160]   of you.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:48.320]   And I've yet to find a single app that does that as well as Scrivener does.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:51.960]   Not only with just creating notes, but also here's a PDF I downloaded and here's a picture
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.060]   that I scanned.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:56.600]   And here are some web pages that have information for me.
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.400]   It's true that I've been using this app for years and years and years.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:03.680]   So maybe it's just that I know exactly, I know exactly how to use this tool.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:09.160]   But every time I look at a new tool, like Devin think, which I haven't seen in years,
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:14.400]   so maybe I should take a look at it, I tend to see it as something that doesn't do what
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.320]   I use Scrivener for as well as Scrivener does.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:19.320]   So for whatever it's worth.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:25.560]   Yeah, I've purchased in the last couple of weeks just to try them all like a number
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.560]   of these.
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.960]   And I think I'm going to end up with Devin think, but anyway, it's, but it's hard.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:32.280]   There's a steep learning curve.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:34.680]   It's complicated, but it does some interesting things.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:39.040]   For instance, it stores the data in text and rich text.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:42.240]   So even if you, you know, they went out of business and you lost the app, you wouldn't
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.240]   lose your data.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:44.240]   Right.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:45.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:46.240]   It's encrypted.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:49.720]   But you can also use your own web dev servers so you can keep it private and personal, which
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.280]   is nice.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:52.280]   I don't know.
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:56.480]   Anyway, that's, that's definitely gives us an update because I'm still trying to figure
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:57.480]   that out.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:58.480]   I'm still trying to figure a lot of out.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.200]   Devin think it's from Devin Technologies dot com.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.240]   And I know a lot of power users use it.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:10.840]   It's, it is definitely going to take some time to understand and use properly.
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.520]   But I've been spending the last couple of weeks working with it.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.400]   For instance, I kept, you know, I had all my travel information in there, but I actually
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:21.320]   used it to also keep a daily diary as I was traveling.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.320]   And it's things like that.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.320]   It applies itself.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:27.320]   Well, if you, if you mess with it, so you know, you know, you're onto something when
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:30.520]   you just find yourself naturally turning to this app.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.080]   You know, you don't, you don't, you don't, you need some, you talk to somebody like me
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.560]   who's told you how well they love Scrivener.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:37.560]   That doesn't mean anything.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.680]   If you have all three of those apps on your, on your desktop and you keep coming to this
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:43.880]   one time and time and time again.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.400]   So whatever works for you, definitely go for it.
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.600]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.520]   So my pick of the week is informed by what we were talking about earlier.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:57.240]   And that is the, the dangers of heat on, on batteries, on iPhone batteries, any car,
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.240]   phone battery.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:02.240]   And what a lot of people, at least my friends were using were the sort of car mounts that
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:05.920]   you plug them into the vents and then they would spew hot air onto the iPhone and they
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:06.920]   would get this.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:07.920]   Why is my screen going dark?
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:08.920]   Why is my phone shutting down?
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:11.080]   Well, because it's getting overly hot.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:15.120]   So I started getting asked a lot of recommendations, especially in light of the recent news.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.800]   And I came upon this one, which I really liked.
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:21.080]   I think I saw it recommended by a couple of people that I trusted.
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:22.080]   I bought one.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:23.080]   I tried it out.
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:25.840]   I ended up getting them as Christmas gifts for a lot of friends of mine.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.680]   And this goes into the CD slot on your car.
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:32.360]   And if you're like me, you haven't used that thing maybe since you bought it because I
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:35.880]   switched, you know, to iPhones fairly early on.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.840]   And I just placed off off of that now.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:44.240]   And whether it's over Bluetooth or over a cable or over, you know, not aux jack anymore,
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:46.400]   but over off a lightning cable, all of those things.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.000]   I just no longer need a CD tray.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.960]   And I found the dash, the one that's on top of the dash, it's a little bit too high and
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:56.400]   a little bit too far away for me to be able to effectively put it in, take it out, do
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.800]   the things I needed to do.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.800]   And this turned out to be a really great solution.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.520]   You just stick it in the CD slot.
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.840]   You turn the little knob so that it's nice and well stuck in there.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:07.880]   You've got a very good neck on it that you can position almost any way you want.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.120]   You just stick your iPhone in there.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:10.800]   I plug mine in while it's in there.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:14.920]   If the charge is low and I want to charge it up, I can plug it in if I want to.
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.960]   I can plug an audio if I want to do that.
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.240]   And then it just works.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.080]   And it's right in between the heating vents.
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.560]   So it gets very little of the hot air that's coming out of the car, which I want all of
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:25.680]   anyway, especially in this weather.
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:27.280]   And I've been using it for about a week now.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.880]   I know George has been using it in her car for about a week now.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:31.920]   And we're both really, really happy with it.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:35.560]   So if you're looking for something for your car, something that's safe and effective,
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.160]   I recommend this.
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:43.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, the iMac Pro is set up.
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.000]   The show is pretty much done.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.360]   I'm just going to...
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.360]   Let's see.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:49.440]   Yes, we got the Apple logo.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.440]   That's all that really counts.
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:51.800]   That means it's real now.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:55.280]   And it's in six colors like all good logos.
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:57.040]   All good Apple logos.
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:59.000]   Yeah, this is a...
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.720]   This was a red letter day for me.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.240]   Got my new Mac.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.680]   Now watch the Mac Pro come out tomorrow.
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:05.680]   That's why I bought it.
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:06.680]   Thank you for doing that, Larry.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.680]   My pleasure.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.680]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:09.680]   We owe you a debt of gratitude.
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:10.680]   Yep.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:12.000]   Renee Richie, so always a pleasure.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000]   Thank you.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000]   Are you moving this week?
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.280]   I am moving the week between the...
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:17.480]   I move out on the 11th.
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:18.800]   I move back in on the 19th.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.640]   And in between those, I'll do the best I can to figure out what I'm doing.
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:22.640]   Okay.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.640]   Well, good luck to you.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:24.640]   Thank you, sir.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.640]   Good luck.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:26.640]   imore.com.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:33.440]   If Apple doesn't do anything dumb in the next few days, Renee will get a little break.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.880]   And if you really want to hear more about this, I managed to grab John Poole from Geekbench
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.720]   and Ben Behairn from Creative Strategies and Jerry Hildenbrand from Android Central, who's
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:41.720]   also an electrical engineer.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:43.440]   And I made them all talk about batteries.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.440]   And I learned a ton of it.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:45.440]   Good.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:46.440]   Ah, good.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.440]   That's vector?
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.440]   Yes, sir.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.080]   Yeah, I love vector.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:51.080]   Learn a lot from vector.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.080]   That's a great podcast.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:53.080]   imore.com.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.760]   Is it imore.com/vector?
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.760]   Did that work?
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.760]   Yes, sir.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:04:59.760]   Or vector.show if you just want the podcast.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.760]   Ooh, I like it.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:01.760]   Vector.show.
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:02.760]   Mm-hmm.
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.440]   You'll find Alex Lindsey at the Pixel Core.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.400]   Anything hot going on these days?
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:11.440]   Right after the last show that we did on the 19th, we did a new Final Cut virtual user
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.920]   group where we went through, we had the experts.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.760]   I mean, really the Final Cut experts talk about the new version and the new stuff that's
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:19.760]   come out.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.760]   And so it's on YouTube.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:21.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:23.040]   It's on the core YouTube channel.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:31.160]   And it is some guys that know much more than me about Final Cut talking about what
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:32.160]   the new features were.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.760]   So if you really want a deep dive, there's a solid hour and a half of us talking about
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:38.560]   the new features and answering questions and so on and so forth.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.680]   And do follow Alex on the Twitter because that's a good way to keep track of what he's
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:43.920]   telling you when I'm doing you.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.640]   @alexlndsay.
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:51.520]   And I'm still using that thing called Instagram that I think is going to be...
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:52.520]   Huge.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.520]   Someday.
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:54.520]   Someday.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:55.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:56.520]   Maybe.
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.520]   Maybe.
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.520]   We'll see.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:03.600]   You know, they should come up with an iOS client because texting your MMS, your big pictures,
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:04.600]   it's okay.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.040]   But once they come up with like an Android app or an iOS app, it's gonna be awesome.
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.040]   That's Andy Inako.
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:11.640]   He's at the Chicago Sun Times.
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:14.400]   He's also online at cwob.com.
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.920]   In his brand new studio.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:17.920]   Very nice.
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:18.920]   I like the molding.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:20.400]   Oh, it's beautiful here.
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.840]   I don't even have shelves up.
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:26.520]   I don't have my books on the wall, but it's like, again, just the idea of, do I make a
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:31.200]   sandwich or do I go next door and have someone make a sandwich for me?
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:32.360]   That's already a win.
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:35.560]   Sudo make sandwich, I think, is the command.
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:36.560]   Yes.
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:37.560]   Yeah.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:42.840]   And by the way, Andy's lip sync brought to you by Alex Lindsey.
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:45.520]   Thank you, Alex, for recommending the sound devices.
[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:46.520]   Mix pre-3.
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.760]   He sounds so good.
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:49.400]   He sounds good and he looks good.
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:55.040]   Yeah, it's like, unfortunately, it's like, okay, it's time for me to buy this, so I'm
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.040]   gonna buy it.
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:57.040]   It's just so good.
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.480]   Yeah, I bought one too.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.480]   Yeah, and it's wonderful.
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:01.280]   I use it at home.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.120]   It's like a whole not another generation.
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:07.920]   We've been using sound device stuff for years and a decade.
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:08.920]   And there it is.
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:09.920]   Oh, mixed pre-3.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.920]   Oh, I remember.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:11.920]   We all have them.
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:12.920]   And I did anything.
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:14.920]   I'm using the pre-2 still.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:16.320]   I have to upgrade my mic.
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:17.320]   He has both.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:21.200]   But he likes it so much, he bought one just for display purposes.
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:25.400]   But I finally got the two when Alex told me to get the three.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:27.720]   So now I'm caught generationally.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:32.280]   Yeah, it's, I think it's probably the third or fourth generation.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:35.480]   And every time they upgrade it, it's just these huge jumps of stuff.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.800]   And it usually becomes less expensive.
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:37.800]   So it's good.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:38.800]   It's the right direction.
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.360]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.600]   We do Mac Break Weekly Tuesday mornings, round 11 a.m. Pacific.
