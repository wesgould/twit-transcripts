[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.620]   is not Leo LaPorte. Leo LaPorte is out in a broad. I am Andy Anatko,
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.180]   tech contributor to WGBH Boston Public Radio and we are joined by our usual wonderful,
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.180]   wonderful panel of scholars and moderators and puzzlers starting with from the Mighty
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.860]   Eye more. Renee Richie, how are you today? You say nice things Andy and I start looking behind me
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.700]   for someone better sitting in the wings. I'm doing really good. Thank you. I always love it when
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.420]   you host. Renee, if there is someone better, just push her forward. That's fine.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.500]   We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.380]   She's taking an app. Sadly, which will be on right after me.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.220]   Yes. I'm in front of a big pond here. There are at least three ducks that I know of that can
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.020]   speak more eloquently about Apple technology than I can. However, the beating all three of those ducks
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.660]   would be Lori Gill, also from IMOR, managing editor of IMOR. Lori, how are you doing today?
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.220]   What? Oh, I was taking a nap. If that rock and roll lifestyle, it's going to catch up with you.
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.540]   Yeah, I know. No, it'll never catch up with me. I will always be rock and roll through and through.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.940]   That's great. Again, there are a lot of people who
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.060]   stopped at 27 who would argue with that, but they wouldn't argue because they're not here to
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.620]   argue with that. Oh, there you go. So you took one of the available slots that opened up after
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.820]   a corps after a Cobain say or after a Belushi say. Yeah, that's that's that's the way to go.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.140]   You jump the waiting list that we jump the waiting list, but we be taking my place because I vacated
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.380]   my seat to take Leo's seat is one of my favorite people to podcast with Doc Rock Doc. How are you
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.500]   today? How are you mellowing out of there? Oh, a little hot cah cah cah cah cah cah cah
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.020]   cah cah cah is good morning in Hawaii when you hear a lohawk that way instead of just the
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.700]   standard of lohawk, which could mean goodbye. And I love you. And Andy, of course, you know,
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.100]   I love to say goodbye to you. And I love to tell you I love you. So therefore, all of the above.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.140]   Thank you guys. It's happy to be here. It's nice to feel loved. And let's just to make sure we
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.580]   understand the full complexity of the sacrifice you're making to be on the show with us. What
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.380]   time is it over in Honolulu? Oh, right now, it's only eight 30 ish. So not that bad. Not as bad as
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.060]   our other show where they make me wake up at four 30. Yeah, but that's that still counts as the crack
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.020]   of any any hour of the morning that's in the single digits is the the crack of eight or the crack
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:25.100]   of nine. So we we absolutely absolutely appreciate all of that. Act for for a very boring summer in
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.340]   which not many things are supposed to be happening. A lot of interesting things kind of happened
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.300]   last week, starting with Apple dumped a whole bunch of operating systems in our labs.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.060]   Let's start off with iOS 12.4 a non beta, a real thing, an actual thing. It's not doesn't seem
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.860]   like Laurie. I haven't installed it because I I'm usually one step behind iOS. It has seems to
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.220]   have a couple of new features. I'm wondering if lots of people are more upset because of a feature
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.020]   it doesn't have though that we thought it was going to have in 12.4. Yeah, so I was so sure that
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.660]   that we were getting Apple card in iOS 12.4, which is what came out on on Monday. I had even
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.060]   written my letter to the editor that that comes out every Sunday from the editor that comes out
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.260]   every Sunday all about how excited I was that Apple card is probably coming. You know, I wasn't
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.580]   saying for sure, but I was like, you know, we're we're we're it's probably coming soon. You know,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.340]   I was getting really excited about it. It's weird because I shouldn't be excited about a credit card.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.900]   I know that but I was I was I really was anticipating it and and actually Mac rumors was the first to
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.300]   leak the show notes before iOS 12.4 came out. And I I even saw those show notes and it didn't say
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.580]   Apple card. And I thought, well, maybe they have it wrong. Maybe they don't have the right show
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.780]   notes. No, as soon as the download happened, I still honestly didn't believe it. You should
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.940]   I was having conversations with the other writers that I'm more and I kept saying to everybody,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.100]   have you actually downloaded? Have you actually checked it? And because mine was still downloading
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.420]   I'm just saying, come on, come on, come on, come on. And no, it just never appeared. So I know that
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.580]   it's sort of like the the prep work for it is there in iOS 12.4, but they didn't flip the switch. It's
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.420]   not ready for us yet. So we have to wait a little bit longer for our titanium credit card.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.420]   So you think there's going to be a 12.4.1 for the card or do you think it's all it's right there?
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.460]   It's just like an Easter egg waiting to be exploded onto our onto our retailers?
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.540]   I think it's more like an Easter egg and it might even get a little bit of a of an official
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.060]   announcement from Apple. They might, you know, send out a press release at six o'clock in the
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.620]   morning my time when I wake up in the morning, it will have already blown up all over the internet.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.020]   It might be something a little more similar to that where there's an official announcement,
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.180]   but it's just a switch that you flip on. Maybe I don't, is there a way to update? No, I guess they
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.020]   would just have to do it over the air and just kind of like in the background update it. Renee
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.420]   probably has a little more insight into how something like that is done on a mobile device,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.140]   but I don't think it's going to require an actual software update. What do you think?
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.820]   Right? Am I right? Am I wrong? And also are they going to sort of submarine it or are they're
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.540]   going to have like ads, ads, ads and a big like a dog and pony show or this just going to be
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.940]   people are going to find a new app on their phones that allows them to suddenly get deeper and
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.060]   credit card debt? No, I think it's just they want it to happen because if you send out the cards and
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.980]   the app isn't working, that's terrible. That's like mobile me, original apps or launch date,
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.140]   terrible. And what they want to do is make sure all the bits are on the phone and it's all built
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.660]   into the wallet app and you sign up through the wallet app and all of those things are there now.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.900]   And then when they start, they'll just flip a sweet, yeah, any queue will come in, he'll punch that big
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.380]   red button and it'll go live on the server side. And then when you go there, they'll just be
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.700]   a little line saying sign up for Apple Card and you'll tap it and everything else. Like all the
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.020]   metrics, the way to display all the information, all the heuristics towards better financial health
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.940]   will all be in place and it'll just be the sign up process. And then I guess it's how
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.260]   confident they are on fulfillment on actually getting the cards out and having the service running,
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.060]   how much they hype it. Like maybe they'll just let the nerds sign up right up front and make
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.180]   sure it's rock solid before getting all our moms and dads involved. But if they're really sure,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.780]   if they're really sure that they can handle it, then they'll just go wide and we'll see commercials
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:24.220]   everywhere. Yeah, you know, that's something I really hadn't thought about before. Like Doc,
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:30.780]   have you thought about how there's a problem where this is a product that's going to be offered to
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:37.100]   everybody, including people of a certain age who know how credit cards work and they don't necessarily
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.540]   think that I'm going to need to have a phone in order to make this work. I'm going to have to pair
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.100]   this. I'm going to have to like set up software in order to get this thing actually up and running
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.540]   so I can buy my my zag nut bars and my movie tickets. Is there going to have to be like some
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.660]   sort of like an Apple class at the Apple store to make this work for people?
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:00.060]   Well, first of all, thank you for pointing out that I have a certain age. I really appreciate it.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:07.020]   I know I know I and I whatever your certain age is, I'm certain times 1.2. I'm sure. So that's not.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.580]   No, I'm older than you. I know this for a fact.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.140]   But what quickly quickly your society.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.700]   People. Okay, if you're watching, if you're on the pod, if you're listening to it by audio,
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.060]   you don't get this. But like you so you live like in like a sunny climate where there's nothing but
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:32.940]   sun every single day almost and you look younger than me. So my skin is like a purplish bluish green.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.700]   I'm not I'm not I that's why I would ask. I don't know that you are younger than that.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:44.140]   I am younger than you. No, what you're what you're experiencing is the spectrum decided to give me
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.780]   the worst connection in the world today, even though I'm always pretty clear just because I'm
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.860]   going to be on me. I decided that that dude's kind of ugly. He's going to represent why in a bad way.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:00.460]   I mean, I do appreciate the extra work with the lovely, say, in the little shirt limited edition.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.700]   But we're going to have to blur that mug a little bit. So nobody thinks that, you know,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.820]   the people here in Hawaii look as such because I am ill representative of that. But anyway,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:17.260]   as far as the question goes, I, you know, the funny thing is, I was up and the, you know,
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.660]   the little software update thing popped up and I go, yeah, man, I can set this up. I'm going to
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.900]   get my apple card. Finally, I've been making sure, you know, all the bills are paid, all the,
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.540]   you know, dots across and teasers whistled. And I'm like, no, card app. So I do think that they're,
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.500]   like Renee said, they're ready for what is going to be the titanium wave. Let me go ahead
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.820]   and coin that hashtag now before I'm more still zit. And you know, we may try like,
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.380]   titanium wave that is Hawaii, you know, tsunami oriented titanium wave. I'm going to take that.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.940]   Or we can go for the literacy with titanium tsunami, maybe. I don't know if that works.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.060]   Anyway, I do believe that there will definitely be some, you know, what we call the mom filter.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.580]   I am going to have to explain this. And I do find myself oftentimes explaining to people why they
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.860]   should be using Apple Pay. You know, a lot of people are still afraid of it. And I try to explain
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.900]   to them that the security features are much, much better. And when you just roll up to the whole
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.700]   foods and tap your phone on a thing versus, you know, sticking in your card and doing all the above.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.900]   So part of it is going to be the education. And there will be some getting over that fear.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.740]   And I think the biggest hurdle will probably be the press, you know, the normal press when they
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.060]   start to talk about it, they won't necessarily say the right stuff because they tend to do it
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.700]   wrong. And it requires people like us to complain and be like, no, don't case, it doesn't work that way.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:47.900]   Yeah, I just I just remember my own relationship with again, there's no bigger nerd than I,
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:54.140]   but my own relationship with like depositing checks in a bank where the first time I knew
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:00.140]   that the ATM outside of the bank can now actually accept check deposits. But something inside me
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.260]   said that, no, give it to the nice lady or the nice young man at the counter that you can verify
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.620]   that, look, he you could tell them, please put this money in my account. And you don't have to ask
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.900]   somebody, where did the $6,300 that I thought was supposed to be deposited into my account go?
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.620]   And I'm usually about a year behind that sort of stuff. So we might see that same sort of thing
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.940]   as people start to learn how to use all these tools and learn how to trust these tools.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:31.420]   But okay, so we're going to have to wait for Apple card. But Lori, what's in 12.4? I always 12.4
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:38.140]   that we were kind of we're going to be grateful for. Yeah, so there's a new way that you can transfer
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.980]   data from one phone to another. So when you go and get your new iPhone, you won't have to use an
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:50.460]   iCloud backup anymore to transfer that data. You can do a direct connect, not through iTunes,
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:57.820]   but you can actually using the camera adapter, you can actually plug one iPhone into another iPhone
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:04.860]   and transfer it hardwired. Or using a local Wi-Fi when your two iPhones are set up right next to
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.980]   each other, it will just directly transfer that data from one to another, which I think is like
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.980]   a really great feature for especially people whose iCloud is getting a little bit bogged down.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:23.820]   And maybe they purposefully don't store their iTunes or their iPhone backup via iCloud or maybe
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.220]   they do it on iTunes, but you won't need to have your computer anymore to do that.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.180]   As long as both devices have the same Wi-Fi network going, you can do it right in the store,
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.820]   which will probably actually make it a lot easier for the Apple employees when customers are there.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.260]   And they're like, "I don't know how to put all this stuff on my new phone."
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:47.340]   I did notice some questions on Twitter about that too about what is it transferred? Everything.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.420]   It's packed like a backup. It transfers everything over. You don't have to worry about
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.820]   re-downloading your apps or anything like that. It's the same thing as if you were using a backup
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.740]   to transfer the data. So it's kind of a neat new feature that I like.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:10.220]   Some bug fixes and other things like that. I think actually one of the bigger updates that
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:18.860]   got a lot of traffic is not so much the iOS update, but the watchOS update is at 5.3, I think,
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.380]   where ECG comes to Canada, which has been kind of... they've been waiting for it.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:31.260]   So Canadians are finally on track to be able to check their heart rate and making sure that it's
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.460]   running as it should be. Which I'm sure may... Renek could finally really, really push himself
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.820]   to the danger zone when he's out hunting a hunt and bono at Pokemon knowing that his
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:45.660]   Apple Watch's electric cardium features have his back. I'm not an AFib and I can keep going. I'm not
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:55.500]   an AFib. I just smell toast. That's normal. I've been under an unusually large amount of stress these
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.700]   last few weeks. I've had the roof turn off the top of my house and been without air conditioning.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.020]   It's been... Was a kaiju right? Was a kaiju?
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:10.780]   Kaiju tore the roof right off. So I have a couple of experiences where I'm just kind of
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:16.540]   sitting around not really doing anything and my heart just started just pounding really hard.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.620]   I wasn't doing anything that would... I wasn't even thinking of things that stressful. It would
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:31.900]   just kind of come up out of nowhere. And every time I would put my finger on my dial, my digital crown
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.860]   and hold it there and get my heart rate check and the ECG, it always came up fine. But there's
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.420]   something sort of soothing about... I knew I was fine and I knew that it was all related to some
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:47.500]   of that extra stress that I was under. But just kind of being able to get that sense of like...
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.380]   Someone else is also telling me that I'm okay. It was kind of a nice feeling. So I'm glad more
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.460]   people are able to access it. So Renee, next time you're feeling extra stressed out and your heart
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.660]   starts thumping, you'll be able to just check out. So extra symptoms because like you can scroll
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.660]   down at the internet, extra symptoms. And those are the ones I worry about. You hit the wrong one.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.060]   It says call emergency right now. Call emergency right now. So I have to be real careful.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:18.780]   I'm feeling kind of itchy. And I don't know. I mean it's not really itchy, but it's still itchy.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.180]   I can't feel the left side of my body. How am I supposed to press the emergency button?
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:32.700]   Yeah. So Canada and Singapore are getting the ECG features. So again, it's given how many stories
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.660]   that we keep getting about people giving their testimony that, "Oh, and then my doctor looked me
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.300]   in the eye and said, 'Thank God for that Apple Watch because without it you'd be dead right now.'
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.380]   And so now it's like, congratulations, Canada and Singapore. Apple has decided that you are worthy
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.380]   of life somehow. So good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:54.620]   Why ask them? Why it was taking so long? And they have to go to every agency, every health agency
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.620]   in every country. And in some cases like the EU, they could do a bunch of them at once. But it
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.940]   really is every agency they have to bring up local experts, they have to present all their case
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.420]   studies, all their data. They have to walk everybody through all of it. And even though it's Apple,
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.140]   their team of medical experts, which includes like from the vice president on down, it's still a
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.020]   somewhat arduous process at times. And some giels are faster than others. So they try to pick the
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.420]   countries that they'll get the most people in this shortest amount of time and then focus on those
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.260]   and try to group them together if they can. I don't know how Canada ended up with Singapore,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:32.380]   but that's the way this one turned out. Sister cities. I always wanted access to that data.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:39.740]   And what I would do is like build an app where when you walk into the bar, it will kind of let
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:45.100]   you know when you walk past someone, if their heart rate tends to perk up a little bit. So you
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.220]   know exactly who to say, Hey, can I can I get did you happen to see that lasting a game of
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.860]   thrones like, you know, or you always come here, you know, some kind of lengthy, but it'd be a
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:00.860]   really cool use of a social thing to walk by and you know, know that this person might be interested
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.900]   in you. We're getting into a dystopian future right now. I don't know if I'm ready for that.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:11.500]   Oh, getting into we've we've we've bought property in the dystopian future. We're
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.780]   already gaming reports. Yeah. But now we're the the real and you're already told Laurie,
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:22.540]   she's out of your IPO. So I want that slide. Again, oh, again, you're you're perfectly welcome.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.700]   And and Laurie, you can get back and you're always back in my good crisis. I just, you know,
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.780]   I flew off the handle. That was that was wrong. So you're you are just as qualified to lose an
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.980]   enormous amount of money on paper as any of my friends and family members are going to be
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.340]   this little sneak preview for friends and family members there.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:49.740]   So so Apple also favored us with the new betas of iOS, their public betas of iOS 13
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:56.700]   and Catalina, the new version of Mac OS. I'm I'm betting Renee that you have done. I'm I want
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.340]   to say at least three. I don't think it's going to be more than six videos in total on those subjects.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:07.740]   How close am I? Well, I try not to do it on individual betas because like everyone panicked
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.900]   that there was a feature missing. You used to be able to hold your finger on a link and get open
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.660]   a new tab and it was missing. So everyone thought Apple took it away. And then one of the Apple
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.700]   engineers goes, no, sorry, bug our bad. It'll be back in the next version. So I try not to be too
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.820]   microscopic about it. I try to cover the big themes of the beta because so much can and will change
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.380]   during the cycle. But we're getting there step by step. And as we talked about before, this has
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.500]   been a hard beta. It's one of the few betas where the engineers were walking around a
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.620]   dug dug shaking their head at you if they thought you were downloading. But it is getting more and
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.100]   more solid. I have it on my main. I don't have it on my main Mac yet because there's some issues
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.820]   with Final Cut that I need fixed before I can use it. But I have it on everything else. And
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:53.180]   it is still a beta. Don't don't get yourself. It is not released software. So if you need it for
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.820]   life live life for like family life, anything important, stay away. But it is it is slowly but
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.660]   surely shaping up for the fall. Yeah, it's it's it's especially problematic because there's so many
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.580]   features that I can't wait to get my hands on. Yes. And even I can't find like I don't even want
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:15.900]   my second Mac to have these these betas on it. And just to just just to give give people like one
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:22.300]   indication of exactly how tough this upgrade this development is. One of the features of public
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:28.140]   beta three is that it gets rid of one of the worst problems of public beta two. I had a little buggy
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.340]   wuggie in there that allowed anybody to get access to all of your secure stored passwords
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.300]   without having to authorize with a fingerprint or face ID or pin or anything. Well, you know,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.700]   whoopsie. If they were already in your phone, they had to be in your phone already. But then
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:49.020]   once they if you handed them your phone, they could be arrested. So let me just say I do have a friend
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:55.740]   that would have taken advantage of that. So I wanted to go to the guy that sits around and taps
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:00.300]   20 times to figure this out. Yeah, I mean, like this is this is this is a job around it's to
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.820]   run and figure these things out. Oh, no, that's that that is exactly what you do. You want to make
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:11.260]   software cry if you're really testing software. So I guess so somebody apparently with beta two
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.940]   did decide to every time when it's go to the website and app passwords menu that stores their
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:23.020]   credentials that are used by Web Auto fill. And so if you tap it iOS is going to say, hi,
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:28.940]   please authorize yourself because we're a very secure phone. And but if you just simply keep
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.940]   tapping it tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, at some point it gives up. It says,
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.420]   you know what, let's stop kidding. Are each other that you're going to authenticate. You know,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.700]   I'm not going to play your little game user. Okay, why don't you if you take all the passwords
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.580]   you want just like the same theory as you know, you see the kid smoking cigarette. If you give
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.220]   them a carton of passwords, he's going to get so sick, he will never try to steal passwords ever
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.180]   again. But yeah, so somebody somebody decided to tap, tap, tap, tap and get that. So yeah,
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:04.460]   this is this is definitely some live ammunition inside inside these betas. But are you liking
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:11.020]   him so far, Renee? Yeah, I mean, the iPad, it's a cliche at this point. But what they've done for
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.900]   the iPad is is transformative. I'm not going to use the dreaded laptop replacement lingo because
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.660]   I disagree with it at its at its foundation. But for people who don't want a laptop, who want
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.380]   an alternative, but who do still need a bunch of classical computer paradigms like, you know,
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:31.500]   file system access and the ability to do more robust windowing. That that all is just working
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.540]   terrifically well already. And if if we're not for Final Cut Pro, I would use my iPad Pro. I do
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.660]   use it now for almost everything except for video editing. Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it. However,
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.900]   there are a couple of I have a couple of friends and they're I think their mutual friends are pretty
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:52.300]   much all of us that have illustrated some maybe bad points by Catalina that Apple is definitely
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.900]   doubling down on security. And the way that Apple doubles down on security is by taking keys
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:04.140]   and sharp objects and tools out of the user's hands. And basically saying, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.820]   don't. If you ever want to open a door, come to us, we'll find the right key for you and open it for
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:17.260]   you. Don't try to open the doors yourselves. Jason Snell, who is again, legendary Mac figure,
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.860]   Apple figure journalist, Mac user of six colors, and frequent guest host on the show,
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:30.140]   was playing with Catalina and sent out a couple of tweets. I'm quoting him after 24 hours of
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.260]   trying to use Catalina in earnest with all my data and apps intact. The new security features
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.460]   are incredibly annoying. Apps constantly asking for permission to see various folders, lots of
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.980]   relaunches and trips to system preferences. It's really unpleasant. I'm not doing his voice. I'm
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:52.700]   just using my own voice at WWDC. No, no, no, no, no, no, it's bad enough. He has to hear his own
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:59.100]   words in my voice, but let alone at WWDC, Apple's presenters said they would not prevent you from
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.220]   running software. You wanted to run on your Mac, but these interface choices are disaffecting a
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:10.620]   very good word from Mr. Jason Snell, editor of Mac world. It feels like my Mac is fighting my
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.900]   choices every step of the way, and there's not even a button to turn it all off. And this sounds
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:23.740]   really, really familiar. Windows eight, anybody that anytime you try to do anything, Windows eight,
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.300]   Windows Vista, and you want to do anything? Do you really want to do this? Or do you have to have
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:34.220]   permission in order to do this? I think that Apple even did a I'm a Mac, I'm a PC commercial,
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.620]   in which they made fun of Windows Vista for asking for all these permissions.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:44.780]   And my concern is that Catalina, this is just one aspect of the giant pain in the butt that
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:51.820]   Catalina is going to be for trying to do things for our own good, but we would much rather just
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.860]   play in the mud and we'll wash our hands later. We don't have to wash our hands right now,
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:03.020]   but Apple's saying, no, no, no, eat your vegetables, wash your hands, put up and put on your good
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:08.380]   pants because your grandma and grandpa are coming. But this is, I gave you $3,000 for a computer
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:16.300]   that I would have fun with, not just a, it seems like a big problem, like a, Doc, what do you think?
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.220]   Do you have faith that Apple will not screw this up?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:32.380]   Yes and no. Yes, because for, here's the hard part about us, our not so silent majority,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:40.060]   okay, those of us who know how to mess with the demons and get in terminal and do those kind of
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:45.580]   things, we love that part about our OS because that's been there for us pretty much since day one.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.980]   And, you know, back in the days from, you know, adjusting KEX so that you can get hardware the
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:56.940]   work the way you wanted and doing like things like that was wonderful, but that was also what was
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.940]   somewhat limiting to people who wanted to enjoy computers, who wanted to use it. The way that we
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.940]   love our computers, there's other people that's always wanted to be us, but they always thought
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:13.340]   that the entry was impossible. And then so what I want to make it analogous to is there are
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:21.980]   millions of really good home cooks, myself included. And I do believe that if I had of
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:29.020]   gone to culinary school and got the actual title chef, I would wear that crown even better. And
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:34.140]   you see, and so what I think we are, the lot of us that are here on the podcast, and probably the
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.140]   majority of our listeners, those are the guys that have been the culinary school kind of way,
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.300]   like they're the real deal chefs. Most other people using their computers are the home cooks.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.700]   They really love it. They're passionate. They spend 20 hours a week in Williams Sonoma,
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:52.220]   you know, buying, you know, various kids, trying recipes. They got Hello Fresh or some box showing up,
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:59.500]   but we are sort of becoming the dying breed. And so they feel like they have to make a decision
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:05.980]   to make it more open to the general home cook and less chefy, you know. So that's what's going to
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.580]   happen with things like, you know, getting into your terminal, having security features, having
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.140]   apps that require, you know, manipulation of gatekeeper and things like that. So it's a weird
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.940]   test 22. And I'm going to miss it. I won't, I won't be wrong because I do it. Not a lot of it now.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.900]   But I think if it makes it easier for my family to stop calling me and asking me crazy stuff,
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.700]   or telling me that their computer got hacked when it's just the internet stopped working,
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:37.020]   you know, because of like a DNS bug or something. My computer's hacked. I can't go to any websites.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:42.460]   I'm like, okay, let's just try a different DNS. It's probably down. You know, and so I think I
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:49.180]   will appreciate that part of it. So yeah, I'm really great on this issue because that's my older
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.700]   kamajini coming up. I really enjoy that getting under the hood. But I think if it opens it up for
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.980]   the greater good, I might be willing to eat that. Hmm.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:05.420]   -Tuk, I have a completely different take on this. So it's funny. I think our general idea behind
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:13.900]   it is the same, but I think of what Apple's doing with Catalina is protecting all of the old
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:20.380]   Mac users from themselves. And this is what I mean. Macs didn't used to need antivirus, right?
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:25.100]   Nobody ever tried to attack a Mac because they weren't very popular. There weren't very many of them.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.740]   But as Mac gets more and more popular, we start hearing more about exploits that are getting into
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:38.860]   our system. So I see Apple as trying to bring these old Mac users up to the current standards of,
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.820]   your Mac isn't as safe as it used to be. I know you used to be able to get away with all this stuff
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.380]   and all these changes and all these downloads. But now it's different. The world is different,
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:55.900]   and you can't live in these wonderful old times. You have to move forward, and we're going to help
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.460]   you by making sure that every time something opens, you actually meant for that to happen,
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.980]   and that it wasn't something in the background that you weren't expecting. So I'm also great on
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:13.660]   this situation because I also do, I think it's one of the joys of the Mac is sort of our ability to
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:22.540]   get inside of it and learn things about it, add things to it that aren't straight from the app store.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.860]   But I can see how as time goes on, and we hear more and more stories about
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:36.380]   attacks on Mac OS specifically, that there's got to be some people in the background over at Apple
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:42.540]   that are saying, "Okay, Mac users aren't used to this. So what do we do? What's the best way to going
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:48.460]   forward to make sure that they actually understand what's being put on their computers, and sometimes
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.020]   even when you delete an app that it's actually still there on your local servers or something like
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:59.740]   that." So yeah, it actually makes sense. Renee, here's what I want.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.420]   Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:09.020]   Yeah, I was just going to say that it's, I'm like right there with both of you, it's a super
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.500]   tough problem because the people attacking the Mac are using vectors that were traditionally
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.700]   used by honest upfront traditional programmers who wanted to hack your kernel in a way that helped
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.780]   you or wanted you to side load apps in the way that helped you or wanted to distribute apps in
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.220]   a way that was hell or they wanted to just get their updates. Mutual friend, again,
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.620]   mutual friend Daniel Jalk had a blog post up saying that he was just trying to update an app
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.340]   and he had to sign it with iTunes even though it was going up with outside of the app store,
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:40.220]   but that was the only way to get the notarization working. And that meant that everyone making an
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:45.420]   app outside the app store is now bound, they have to go in and sign the iTunes terms of service
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.500]   just to distribute their app. If there's a critical bug fix, you have to make sure they're up to date
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.300]   with iTunes, you know, with iTunes Connect policies just to give you that update. And that is so
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.020]   frustrating. But at the same time, that is exactly what someone who wanted to put malware on your
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:04.620]   computer would use as an attack vector. And Apple is really caught in the middle in this world because
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.580]   unlike Windows has to bring Windows forward, they weren't able to make a new operating system yet.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.620]   And Google doesn't have a 1970s-esque operating system. They let go of DOS,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.660]   they never had DOS, they built Android fairly recently. Chrome OS is even more modern,
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.060]   they don't have to worry about it. And Apple is busy juggling this traditional computing base
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:30.940]   with this modern 100 million billion user base. And it isn't, I had all those alerts. I know Apple
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.860]   is trying to make it so that if you have an explicit user action, like if you tap on the file,
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:39.180]   that just blasts you right through because obviously you want to do it. But if the app tries to get
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:44.060]   to that file without your permission, then whoa, access panel. And the balance is probably too
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.380]   tight right now. So I hope as we complain, as Jason Sennell and us complains, they'll sort of
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.540]   figure out that balance. But I think it's going to be real tough for the next two or three years
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:57.740]   as they try to figure all this out. Doc, what's something else you want to say?
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:04.140]   Yeah, I was going to say I need a couple of the soundbites. When I was in radio, we used to get
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.580]   guests to do Liners for us. And then we used those liners in our show. So I need Laurie to say,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:16.060]   Doc, don't drink that whiskey. Put that down. You had enough. Please do not insert another piece
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   of grilled meat in your face. Because that voice of reason is just incredible. You know, so I'm going
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.940]   to send you a couple of liners and I'm going to just put them in a soundboard. So my EKG,
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:32.300]   on my watch, press around this, this app will pass, but I'm going to make an app where my EKG
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:37.100]   passes certain things. It would be like, dude, come on, back up from the burrito. Burrito down.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.540]   Go over. You're full.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.340]   Top, the top burrito down.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.260]   You're very good.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:48.060]   Well, I was getting back to Gatekeeper, though. I was shocked to find out, like a few months ago,
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:53.180]   that developers or developers can't just simply assume that the Dropbox folder is somewhere
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:58.940]   and automatically just set up someone to set up a user to use the Dropbox folder. They have to be
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.660]   asked through kind of a stern system dialogue box to go find it yourself because I don't have
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:11.180]   permission to go and select a folder that's outside of my sandbox, which seems kind of silly.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:25.660]   There was one response to Jason Stell's original tweet that kind of got to me.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.140]   We were all big fans at James Thompson, a creator of PCCal, a creator of that wonderful
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.700]   dice game that we just, we were all like embarrassing him saying, "Oh my god, this is so great. Oh my god,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.580]   James, I want to, I want to bury your children. James, you're so wonderful."
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:46.380]   So late, late, late, late last year, he just, he made it a little announcement. Oh, by the way,
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.820]   I'm not going to be updating Drag Thing for the foreseeable future because I don't,
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:55.260]   yeah, I'm kind of, I'm pulling it from the app store. Drag Thing is this amazingly cool utility
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.500]   that you just drag things off of the screen and there'll be sort of like held in advance
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.700]   until you actually need them and can drag them someplace else. And so he responded to Jason's
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.740]   tweet saying, "Honestly, this is all part of my decision not to rewrite Drag Thing. The writing
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.980]   is on the wall for system-level utilities, even if it's tolerated currently." So his feeling as a
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:21.180]   really, really, really important developer is that there's a whole bunch of system enhancements,
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:25.340]   so a whole bunch of things to make a computer work better that Apple is not going to allow
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.420]   developers to do. Or if they're allowing them to do them right now, they can't count on that
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.780]   still being permitted a year from now. And that kind of, that kind of bumps me out
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.740]   because it's really, it's developers like James Thompson who show Apple and show all of the,
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:45.660]   all of the users how cool this thing can be and directions that you quote that Apple could,
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.140]   could go through. But unfortunately, the number of people who really want utility like Drag Thing,
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.700]   it's not everybody and might confuse too many people. But the people who want Drag Thing should
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.340]   be able to get it. We need to go to an ad, but before, let's, before that, let's just have a quick
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:10.540]   whip around discussion. Is the, my problem with a lot of these things is that it seems as though
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:16.220]   Apple is really trying to make the Macintosh more like an iPad. And I've always really believed
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.260]   that there's, there are so many advantages to having an iPad or an iPhone that is heavily
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.220]   sandboxed, heavily locked down. I can't sideload apps on it, but that's probably all to the good
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:31.500]   for this device. And if there is, if I do want to have a wild wild west sort of thing,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.740]   record inter terminal campaigns, do whatever I want with my computer, I still love my Mac.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:41.500]   And it seems as though Apple is sort of locking down my Mac to the same degree that they're locking
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:47.900]   down the iOS. And do you think that there are lines that Apple shouldn't cross in terms of
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:54.220]   limiting, I'll put it this way, limiting the amount of danger a user can put themselves in
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:01.500]   by making, by foolish acts of bravado and command line devilry. Renee will start with you, I think.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.340]   Yeah, I'm going to quote, you know, the oft quoteable John Gruber where he said the lightness of
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.380]   iOS is what should let the Mac be heavy. And I think the ability to have an iOS device if that is
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.660]   what you want should allow the Mac to be highly differentiated in a way that a traditional open
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.220]   computing system should be. But at the same time, I realized that if people start getting
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.460]   viruses and malware and ransomware left and right, it's not going to be good either. So what I would
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.420]   just like is to have all this stuff in place. But instead of these complex, and I say this as
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:36.220]   someone not responsible for implementing any of it, of course, is the ability to just hit an expert
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:41.020]   button or put it up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, A, B, you know, and go into expert mode
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.500]   and have all of this stuff disappear. And I've signed my name saying I'm a grown ass adult and
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.540]   I'll take responsibility for it. Then all that stuff goes away and I'm left to my own devices.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.500]   If that's like going into Unix mode, if that's what I want. Yeah.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:02.220]   Lori, what do you think? Well, so I think that Apple absolutely should not
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.620]   lock down our Macs. The Mac is completely different than a mobile device like an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.100]   There are things that we need to be able to put on our computers for our daily work.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:20.700]   A computer is meant to be your work station. Even if you can make an iPad, a workstation,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:25.660]   a computer is meant to be that way. So absolutely should not be locking us down
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.860]   in that same way that you can only get apps in the App Store for iPhone and iPad.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.260]   But I also don't think that that's what Mac is what Apple is going to do.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:42.540]   I know there's some hints that they're making it more difficult, but I think that
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:49.420]   so for some situations, people who like to just kind of casually make a fun app and they're not
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   looking, they don't want to make money off of it, but it costs them too much money or too much
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:59.580]   effort to keep it going because of Apple's restrictions. That's unfortunate and I hate the
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:05.100]   idea that there's great apps out there that won't be continued to receive updates because
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.300]   Apple makes it so difficult for them to just let you download it right directly from the website.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:18.780]   But at the same time, good app developers, they understand too, they understand the importance
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:25.500]   of safety and security. And if they have the wherewithal, if they have the resources to continue
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:34.060]   signing these certificates and stuff, it's good, it's fine. They keep doing it and we get a second
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:41.340]   level of safety and security. So it is a balance that needs to be had so that we're protected as
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:47.260]   user, but there is a hard line and it's that Apple should never under any circumstance
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.940]   make us only download apps from the Mac App Store because there's way too much stuff just around
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.860]   in the world that we need to be able to put on our computers and if Apple takes that away from us,
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.100]   that's the first time I'm saying this in my life. I would have to leave Mac if that happened.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:05.020]   So yeah, yeah, Doc, what do you think?
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:15.100]   I think maybe there's a possible like best of both world solutions. So I know Leo loves to talk
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:23.260]   about his Yubikagi. Wait, sorry, Yubie his finger. Kagi is key, Yubiki. I hate when companies use
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.740]   Japanese words because they messes up a Japanese speaking person. So today, I don't know, that's
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:38.700]   no key, my height to do. If you have a key type thing that you can purchase from Apple or maybe even
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.020]   you have to physically authorize that it's you the same way you would a credit card or something of
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:49.900]   that nature and then they compare that to the Mac address of your computer and it's key and you
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:55.900]   plug it in. When you have those two things in place, like a second form of authentication or MFA of
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:02.220]   some sort, you plug it in the back, it says, I am Rene Ritchie. I am Doc Rock. I know what I'm
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:08.780]   doing. Let me do that. I think that would be cool, right? Similar to the way like now on modern
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.900]   cars, you can't necessarily get into a lot of the engine stuff. So we go through an ODBC slot
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.780]   where you stick this thing in and now you can do those, you know, sort of racer oriented tweaks
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:24.620]   to your vehicle. I think if we have something like that where it actually requires some hoops to
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:29.100]   whatever is to get authorized, but once you authorize and they know what you, let me do what I want,
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:35.020]   but I'm also taking that risk because as an ex genius, one of the things that always kind of
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.540]   chapped us is when the people that thought they knew what they were doing would come in and hold
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:42.300]   something up and then come and yell at us because it's our fault because they did something they
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   shant them done. So I kind of want to take the best of what Laurie said about keeping us protected
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:56.540]   from ourselves, but also still give a person like me the ability to go in and mess with things
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.260]   accordingly. You know what I mean? So I know everyone's up in arms about not being able to
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.140]   change. Ram half the time, but you know what happens a lot less, bringing the computer in
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.580]   because it doesn't work because you buy some crappy Ram because you didn't want to buy from
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.540]   OWC because it was $3 more. Or it got unseated when it sounds around a bit.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:20.700]   Yeah, yeah, something like that. So I think if there's an authentication key, I can't speak English
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:26.540]   today, and you can plug that in and you've proof of that you are who you are, and you know what you're
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.580]   doing and you're willing to take the risk, yeah, go for it. I think that would be a great way to do
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.380]   it. It's almost like when someone leaves the hospital against medical advice, they have to sign
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.580]   to say that if you fall out when you get like three steps down the road, you can't sue Dr.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:47.820]   Vinnie Boombots because he gave you better advice. Very, very good Ronnie Dangerfield reference.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:55.500]   I give you 10 points for that. I see with, I'll try to be quicker. I just think that there is such
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.540]   a thing as ownership, and you either have ownership of your computer or you don't have ownership.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:06.140]   And if you don't have the power to do anything you want with a computer, including the power to
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:12.780]   screw it up entirely, if you're doing something that is ill advised, then you're not just,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:19.580]   it's not your computer. Apple is just giving you permission to for the for the for the plum price of
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:26.700]   1100 to $35,000 who just use their hardware amongst certain terms of conditions and conditions that
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:33.260]   they're willing to change or rescind at any time. And I really think that ownership is an important
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:39.020]   thing. When you put those kind of handcuffs on somebody that you kind of stifle their development,
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:44.460]   this is not my computer anymore. I want to put stickers on it. I want to change the desktop.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.740]   I want to change the font size if I want to. If I want to go into if I want to take a look at what
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:56.380]   what files are in these Unix system directories and what do they do? That's curiosity and that's
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:02.300]   learning and you can't stifle someone from from learning about this thing that they have.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:11.500]   They keep coming back to the line from the right stuff where John Glenn's capsule is having problems
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.780]   in the Capcom is saying you tell him the he's a pilot. You tell him the condition of his spacecraft
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:22.380]   and let him make his make the decisions. That's how I feel. I'm not not John Glenn. I'm simply a
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:28.860]   guy who was able to scratch up enough money for for a MacBook Pro. But I am the pilot of this machine
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:34.620]   will give me let me give me the information I need to take control and know the condition
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:42.060]   of my craft. So I hope this I just hope that we don't have a an iOS sort of thing happening on
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   Mac OS because I don't think that the Mac will pretty much recover from that. Well, and on that
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.100]   note, we go to Leo Le Porte who has an important and savory message for us.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.420]   Thank you, Andy. A little break in the action. Well, I tell you about our sponsor, great sponsor.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:04.060]   We use this sponsor zip recruiter. It's the best way to hire hiring is tough. Look, if you're in
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:10.380]   charge of hiring for your company, if it's a small company like ours, that means you're missing
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.260]   somebody. You're down a person and that can be the worst time to have to go to all the trouble of
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:22.060]   hiring unless you use it recruiter. Even giant companies use it because it's just the best way
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:28.140]   to find the perfect candidate for that opening. Hiring is simple and smart on zip recruiter.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.860]   Growing businesses can connect to qualified candidates as simply as possible. If I said
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:38.300]   recruiter, well, as soon as you post a zip recruiter, put your posting on 100 plus job boards,
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:44.620]   including social networks. So you cast the net as wide as you possibly can, meaning that no matter
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:49.500]   where your perfect candidate is, no matter what industry you're in, they're going to see that
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:55.340]   wonderful job opening. Hiring is tough. I mean, multiple job sites, you got to post two stacks of
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:02.540]   resumes reviewing those resumes. Your inbox is full. Your phones just don't stop ringing or
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.860]   you use zip recruiter. All the applicants go to the zip recruiter interface where you can screen
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.020]   them easily with yes, no questions, multiple choice, even essay questions, eliminate the
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:16.940]   candidates that don't make any sense. Zip recruiter will not overwhelm your phone or your inbox because
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:21.340]   it's a home, the zip recruiter interface, they even pre-format the resumes. So they're all the same.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:27.420]   So it's easy for you to scan through them. But the best part of zip recruiter is their powerful
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:33.420]   matching technology. Zip recruiter scans the thousands, actually millions of resumes they have on file
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.820]   to find people with the right experience. Then they send an invitation to them saying,
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.140]   "Hey, there's a great job you should be applying for." As the applications come in,
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:47.020]   Zip recruiter analyzes each one, spotlights the top candidates. So you'll never miss a great match.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.540]   We found this too. As soon as we started using Zip recruiter, we couldn't believe it. We were
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:58.380]   getting great applicants almost instantly. Lisa posted our job opening at breakfast by lunch.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.660]   We had two or three great candidates. She kept saying, "Wait a minute, here's another one."
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:07.180]   Another one just came in. She was so happy. Zip recruiter is so effective that four out of five
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:12.460]   employers who post on Zip recruiter will get a quality candidate through the site within the first day.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:18.140]   We got one in the first hour. Right now, MacBreak Weekly listeners can get zip recruiter free.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:24.540]   If you go to our special address, zip recruiter.com/macbreak. Great way to show your support for MacBreak
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:31.500]   Weekly. Thank you, Zip recruiter, for letting us do this zip recruiter.com/macbreak. You're going
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:38.700]   to love it too. It saves you a lot of time. Zip recruiter, the smartest way to hire zip recruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:44.460]   Now back to Andy and MacBreak Weekly. Thank you, Mr. LaPorte. Well,
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:53.340]   the fortress of Integritude that Apple is famous for surrounding all of their unannounced products.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:59.020]   It seems that someone's leaving some windows open. We've been talking for the past couple of
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.500]   months about features about the 2019 iPhones that were pretty sure are going to happen.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:12.780]   MacRumors kind of topped everybody by getting their whole getting a hold of actual like non-functioning
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:18.700]   dummy iPhones. These are model iPhones that have the have the body work, have all the the fittings,
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:23.500]   have all the details on it so that people who are manufacturing cases can officially see how
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.860]   these things are going to fit into these case designs. So they have the full trio confirming that
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:36.780]   they will be a 5.8 inch, 6.5 inch and a more affordable 6.1 inch iPhone. Just like this year,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:42.300]   the square camera bump that we've been seeing in like putative renders are certainly there.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:48.380]   We see an extra lens on each of them. So the 2018 phones that have two lenses have three
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:55.420]   and the cheap phone that has only one has two. And maybe some fit and finish is a little bit up in
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.060]   the air, but it really is a very credible look at what these things are going to actually be.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.620]   They have a video in which they compare them physically with 2018 models and it looks
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:11.340]   side by side like if you didn't flip them over, you wouldn't actually know you were looking at 2019
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:18.780]   iPhones. That's a little bit surprising to me, although it is July and we're getting close enough to
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:26.540]   the announced date that a lot of dopes have to be clued in on on secrets from Apple.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:33.740]   What do you think, Doc? How did this happen? And is this a sign of a more
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:40.380]   peristroika like Apple, more hippie, piece love? Oh, by of course, take our new car for a drive.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.660]   Let your aunt drive it.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:50.700]   Okay, first, let me start out by saying out of no disrespect to people like Rene and Marcus
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:57.500]   MacRumors, you know, German, everybody that does this stuff. I personally don't like the rumors in
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:04.300]   the early leaks because I am the guy who loves Christmas, right? I really miss the days of,
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.780]   okay, so first of all, there's in caveats. Let me put this in. It's a little selfish on my part.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:14.060]   I happen to be born on a day that iPhones always come out. Okay, so I'm set to 12.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:22.940]   And normally within about one or two days, sometimes dead on my day, I get a new iPhone on my birthday.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:28.140]   Rene will back me up if you go through the last nine years, my iPhones come out on my birthday.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:36.620]   So a week later, it's in my hands. So I missed that birthday present. I got my nice, you know,
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:42.540]   robust old pour over done. I'm sitting there and somebody walks out on the stage and go dock
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:50.380]   just for your birthday. Here comes a new iPhone. And I'm like, oh, Mahalo Nui Loa, right? So when
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:58.700]   everyone gives away and I try to keep this PG as possible, my dad used to tell me you never want
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:05.420]   to go to a place where the exotic dancers were already on buff when you walked in. It would just
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:10.460]   ruin the whole surprise. Even though you know what it looks like, even though since you've been 13
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:15.420]   year olds, stealing books from your mom and your dad, whatever you're into, like, you already know
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:21.740]   what's going to happen. It's not the same thing. You want that reveal. So with that said, the reality
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:29.820]   is we live in a time and space where these things come out. So in a way, I think it does help someone
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:36.380]   who, you know, say you have a month and a half now to get your ducks in a row, pull out your
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:42.060]   little freelance work, call up your clients that owe you money to make sure that you have the
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   cheddar in place when the phone comes. You also have a better idea if you're going to get that
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:57.020]   lilac to match Lori's hair, you know, or something of that nature. So I see the benefits of it and
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.940]   yeah, but I just missed the Christmas part. So I'm a really hard person to ask that question to
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:08.620]   me because I deeply, deeply miss waking up to announcements where we know nothing. So to this day,
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:14.460]   even at Dub Dub, when we get to the end of the presentation and they say something that nobody
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:19.180]   saw coming, I'm like, Oh, Hercules, Hercules. I really love that.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:26.540]   Well, Renee, I don't think Apple is really, really pleased when these things leak out. I think they
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:31.900]   also like seeing the delighted, the delighted look on Doc's face is unwraps that present and he
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.460]   doesn't like it when people spoil it surprise with them either, do they? No, and I mean, this
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.860]   year was particularly interesting because every year, like a few people like Marquez usually gets
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:44.700]   the models and a couple of MKBHD usually gets the models a couple other people. This year,
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:49.420]   like everybody in their YouTube channel has them. There's like 19 videos on my device right now
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.500]   that are all queued up with, Hey, I got the dummy iPhone unit. And some of them vary a little bit
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:58.780]   like they have the black finish or they have the glass finish on top of the cameras pretty much
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:04.540]   the same. And I think what's happened this year is Apple has been cracking down so much on the
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.860]   manufacturing facilities. And there's a, I think the information had the story where they were
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:15.180]   trying to smuggle them out using tunnels and in clothing that right now the biggest egris was
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.260]   the CAD drawings. And we've seen those pop up on Twitter for a couple of years, but now people
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:23.820]   have gotten good enough that they can take those CAD drawings and produce actual dummy units off of
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.580]   them. And like you said, they don't have all the details, which is why I think we see the variances
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:31.180]   and there's a couple, maybe it's the same person, but I seem to least a couple different person,
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:35.980]   people who are supplying these and they'll offer them to you. And if you want them a couple
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.220]   days later, they're on your YouTube channel for like 150 bucks or something. And we've just seen
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:45.580]   a deluge of the reporting. And I'm with thought, I don't like the surprises being spoiled. I sort
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:49.820]   of hedged that a bit because we all know Apple's gonna make another iPhone and there's certain
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:54.700]   things that just we feel like they have to make because of market conditions or competition.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:53:00.460]   I like to hear the explanation. For me, the seeing the device kind of ruins it. I cover it because
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:04.940]   if something seems like dumb and incorrect and stupid, I don't want people to get upset about it
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:11.740]   or rage about it if they don't have to. But when Tim gets up and Phil gets up and Jaws gets up and
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:16.220]   they explain why they're doing what they're doing, that to me is the fun part.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:20.300]   So I'm okay with seeing all this stuff now, but man, it's a lot this year.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:28.860]   Yeah, definitely. They're mostly confirming things we've already had leaked from other sources.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:35.100]   Before Lori gets in, I do have that story from the information that Renee was talking about here.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:42.540]   Basically talking about exactly this incident where the biggest discovery of how weak the
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:48.300]   security was at these factories was when somebody actually drove out of the manufacturing facility
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:54.940]   with a truckload of iPhone 5C cases. And that's when Apple decided to create this new strike task
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:00.460]   force to look into this. Apple, according to this article, once even caught factory workers,
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:05.580]   "digging a small tunnel in a corner of a room behind a large piece of machinery,
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.700]   hoping to use it to funnel stolen components to the outside,
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.420]   "people were chipping away little by little at the wall,"
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:17.980]   "Shawshank Redemption style." And if you're seeing Shawshank Redemption,
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:25.500]   you really, really got to want a case bad to use that avenue to get a case out there.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:36.060]   And they get paid so much for those leaks, though. Post iPhone 5C crackdown is
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:42.780]   they say it's working so well that, like Renee said, they quote, "more leaks come from inside
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:47.820]   Apple," and quote, according to the team. And their focus is now on theft of digital assets like
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:53.820]   the CAD files that we were seeing everywhere about a month or two ago. Lori, you want to
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:55:04.460]   kick it on this? Just like everybody else has been saying, I love the anticipation that comes
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:10.940]   with a new Apple device that comes out when the rumor mill gets started. And first, you're hearing
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:17.180]   about different screen types, and then you're hearing about a new camera spec and removal of a
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:22.140]   home button or all these things. When it starts and it's all in this sort of rumor,
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:28.380]   sort of aspect, and you just don't know what to believe, I love that part because it builds up
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:33.260]   this great anticipation. It's like thinking that you're getting to open a present on your birthday,
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.980]   but you're not sure if that's what's coming, but you think you know, and that's even more exciting.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:45.420]   That's how it feels. But as soon as we get to things that are like actual cases or actual
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:53.340]   dummies of phones, that definitely pulls the magic out of it for me so that when the press
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:56:00.220]   event happens and you're sitting there and Apple is just about to announce the new iPhone and it
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:05.740]   gets announced and then you're like, yeah, that's what it looked like for the last 25 pictures that
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:13.900]   I looked at for the last three months. So there it is, nothing new. I do wish that there would be a
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:21.100]   little bit of a backing off on us as these tech bloggers covering that level of leak.
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:27.020]   Obviously you want to cover it because it's going to get you a lot of people looking at your
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:33.820]   stuff. But if we backed up a little and we just kind of talked about our anticipations of it and
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:41.100]   instead we were dissecting rumors instead. That to me is all that sort of like JJ Abrams style,
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:48.060]   what does that mean? And we're kind of losing that sort of feeling of what does that mean when
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.580]   it's like, here it is right in front of you. You don't have to try to figure out what it means.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:58.620]   So yeah, yeah, I think the more interesting story about this is just the fact that it used to be
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:05.900]   if someone if someone smuggled out like a Pentelobe screw and all the only information anybody
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:11.580]   got was that Apple is going to switch to security screws. You feel as though there were a lot of
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:18.780]   people inside Apple that are going to find that there there like the ET clean room tunnel had been
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:23.420]   set up for their office to make sure they scrub down every single piece of evidence to see who
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:28.620]   has smuggled out that one screw. And it seems as though we're getting a lot more information these
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:35.100]   days than we used to maybe motivated partly by the fact that if you create a video with a mock,
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.700]   a really good mock up, you're going to make money off of it, which means that now there's a market
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:46.060]   to create really good mock ups based on the latest known intelligence or the or visuals or animations.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.780]   So maybe that's hard. As our good friend, Jim Kramer once told us, if you can get a rumor
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:54.540]   going that Apple's going to be boring or bland or it's not going to be a good iPhone, man,
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:59.420]   can you move that stock price and make your shots? Yeah, I will say that I think there's one good
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:07.020]   thing about it. The one thing that there's I do like the delight of being surprised by something
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:12.140]   that we didn't know Apple company is going to announce or we kind of knew that this was happening,
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:16.300]   but we didn't had no idea it was going to be this wonderful. I think the iPad certainly qualifies
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:22.860]   for that for pretty much everybody, the iPhone as well. But I'm kind of concerned that these are
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:27.900]   like luxury gadgets, even though they're really good and they're useful and they can change lives,
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:34.540]   they're still luxury gadgets. And I kind of like the idea that instead of just being shown a
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.460]   firework and you're being dazzled by the explosions and the colors and the flashing lights like,
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.660]   oh, I got to have it. I got to have it. I like the idea that they just sort of like
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:48.460]   this little light starts glowing in April or May and it starts getting brighter and brighter and
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:52.540]   brighter so that by the time September rolls around, it's like, yeah, it's a new iPhone. Yeah,
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:58.220]   it's pretty much what we thought it was going to be. Yeah, my screen is cracked on my iPhone 8.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:02.860]   It's probably a good year to buy. I'm probably going to wait a month to make sure I can get the
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:08.380]   color and the capacity I want. I'm glad we're no longer these sort of demonic,
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:13.580]   possessed people who are like, I was number one to get the new iPhone 3. I got the first one.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.940]   And look, everybody interview me. I got the first one. Like, oh, you bought a phone and it's a nice
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:25.100]   phone and I'm glad you're happy. But I'm wondering if you know that the local food bank needs volunteers.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:30.460]   I don't know. There's energy that could be applied in different places. I'm not telling you how to
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:37.740]   run your life, sir. I'm just saying. So now that we've decided that rumors are unhealthy,
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:42.860]   let's talk about some rumors. Now this is a really interesting one.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:50.460]   So we were hearing a lot of people who are in the supply chain making speculation and coming up
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:55.180]   with some pretty good arguments about kind of components we're going to be seeing in 2020 based
[00:59:55.180 --> 01:00:02.540]   iPhones. One that kind of excited me was in BGR. They headline their story with the headline
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:08.460]   Apple's iPhone 12 will pack a processor unlike anything else in the industry.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:17.180]   This here referring to a report in Digitimes that was kind of submarineed in the CEO of TSMC,
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:24.940]   a chip manufacturer who builds the A series processors for Apple's devices, was doing a Q&A
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:30.140]   at an investor conference and said that, oh, well, most of their stuff is like seven nanometer
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:38.460]   CPUs. And they announced last year they're on a timeline to get up to speed on five nanometer
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:43.020]   CPU fabrication. And during this Q&A said, yeah, we're actually being a lot more aggressive about
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:49.180]   that. And we're pretty sure we're going to be able to ship five nanometer CPUs in quantity to
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:58.540]   to our to our people in the next the next nine or 10 months or early 2020, which would make you
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:07.340]   think that maybe the A14 the A14X CPU that you expect to be in the iPads and the iPhone's of 2020
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:13.100]   will have these really, really much faster, much more compact, much more bang for the millimeter
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:23.180]   running a lot cooler, taking up a whole lot, a lot less less energy. That is intriguing. Renee,
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:29.740]   you are cursed with like me about having to read 100 page PDFs about about the
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   thought micro nano lithography and understanding chip fab procedures. What do you think about
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:40.620]   this? Do you think that five nanometers could attainable in 2020 and it'll be as big a deal as
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:46.620]   BGR thinks? Yeah, I mean, the one important thing to remember is that these are marketing terms now,
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:51.100]   we've gone away from them being literal measurements, which is why you hear about Intel's 10 nanometer
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.900]   process will be analogous to the Taiwan, Sanamu, conductor manufacturing seven nanometer process.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.820]   And you say, well, those are different nanometers just slow down there. But no, they're these are
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:03.900]   all marketing terms. And they're just they're going to get smaller. I think I think Andy, correct me
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:10.380]   from wrong, we're still avoiding quantum and scale, but it could be an advanced situation fairly soon.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.700]   But the overall thing is that if you can fit more transistors in the same space, you get so many
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:19.420]   efficiencies, not just power, but you reduce heat and heat is like the one enemy of all electronic
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.820]   components. And we've seen that with Intel now where they've not been able to make it down to 10
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.380]   nanometers for so long in order to improve performance, they're throwing in cores and cores are hot.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.060]   And it blows the thermal envelope of the devices that were planned to have much smaller,
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:39.340]   much smaller dies in them. And it just it just magnifies the badness. And if Apple can keep
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.420]   increasing the power the size, the complexity of the chips, while at the same time the die is
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.100]   shrinking, you sort of get all this stuff. I don't want to say for free because it's super
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.260]   hard engineering work and I'm sure they don't feel like it's for free. But you essentially get
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:55.980]   massive gains without all the bad side effects of them. And that's and especially if all these
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.460]   rumors were hearing, and I'm sure we'll get to this about Qualcomm licenses and Intel modem
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.820]   businesses. If Apple can start integrating those SOCs to be to even if there's a thin modem, but
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.060]   if they can just make more and more of this stuff smaller and smaller and more integrated, then
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:14.220]   it runs better for longer, faster and a lower temperature. And it's a huge win for us.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.980]   Yeah, I still remember when the first long conversations I had with the with a mobile CPU
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:26.300]   engineer who said that half of my half of our job as engineers is to design an architecture so
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:31.420]   that this CPU never runs at its full capacity. Because if it runs at its full, it could run at
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:37.740]   its full capacity for about a fraction of a second before it pops. And and and and because all it's
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.140]   all about power management, it's all about heat management. And so it's intriguing because
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:49.260]   possibly because I don't think any other company is as aware of the value of every square
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:55.740]   section of a millimeter of real estate inside an iPhone is. And so if you allow them to
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.340]   double the processing power in half the space, there's a lot of stuff that's on the whiteboard
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.860]   that gets taken off the whiteboard and gets put gets put into production.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:13.020]   Doc, do you get do you get excited about about lithography like this? You or is it basically something
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:20.620]   that doesn't translate? Yeah, no, honestly, I used to and I think it was more exciting to me
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:28.380]   when I was able to zero in searches for it's ad a socket, ad a processor, change processors and
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.820]   things like that. Once I got into where I'm working with computers where that is no longer a thing,
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:40.380]   I don't pay as much attention to it. Although I do pay attention to power consumption, power
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:46.780]   management, and some of the whether they used to call it very large sale integration, like when
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:52.540]   they take things and push it all into a single chip. So to me right now, still one of the most
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:57.500]   incredible chips to come out in the last couple of years has been the wireless chips that are inside
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:03.820]   your little favorite buddy here. And I really appreciate that. From fighting,
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:09.740]   fighting Bluetooth connections here and there and just be able to pull this guy out, slap it in
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:16.220]   my dome and it works and it works for hours on end. I really, really love that. And so I want
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:21.740]   them to keep fostering these better and better chips. I'm not with Elon, I'm not ready to stick
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:28.380]   one in my cranium yet. But, you know, the good thing about the chip and the cranium.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.860]   It's only the electric roads. Don't worry about it. So only the it's only the wires that fry your
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:38.300]   new list, not the chips itself. Those are excellent. I mean, I do believe the chip would be whiskey
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:44.460]   proof, which would allow me to drink more. So I might dive in if that's an option. But, you know,
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.740]   I love me a good single. Down the whiskey. Oh, Laurie, thank you. Thank you.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:58.940]   I do appreciate the tech and stuff like that. I just tend to care more about like some of the
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:05.500]   things that it will do the feature benefit more so than a tech anymore. And that might just be a
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:10.300]   sign of trying to become accustomed to the writing on the wall that Apple is going to start hiding
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:19.180]   things from us nerds. Yeah. And Laurie, that's really an intriguing notion, the idea that
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.460]   Apple really is all in on if we can if we can design our own CPUs for exactly the purpose that
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:31.420]   we're aiming it at. There's nothing we can't do with not just a phone or tablet, but also a laptop.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:38.060]   So really, this is it is it is like one of the fantasy technologies. If Apple gets to run a muck
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:43.900]   with a better processor die, that's the sort of thing that gets me smiling all day and all night.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:51.100]   Yeah, but it's really a great way for Apple to sort of maintain that kind of control that
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:56.940]   that they want over everything. So like being able to sort of be the lead on this
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:03.420]   five nanometer technology really definitely makes a huge difference in like the future of what Apple
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:09.660]   could do. I mean, right now we're talking about everything we know that exists, but there was a
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:14.300]   time when a smartphone was not a thing and there was a time when a tablet wasn't a thing. And so
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:20.300]   the potential for what you could do could get pretty vague. I can't even imagine what that
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:25.900]   would be. There's outside of computers and tablets and smartphones. What's the next
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:30.780]   gadget that could be in everybody's hands? Absolutely.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:36.380]   Or your hands. Yeah. Get out of my head, man. Get out of my head.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:42.060]   What does it make something that lets the food taste in the mouth to give you satiation?
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:49.420]   So like if I don't like to talk. If I can have a tooth cap that tastes like, you know,
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.900]   Ben and Jerry's rather than actually eating that Ben and Jerry's and it faked my brain and feeling
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:59.740]   like I don't need it. Apple could revolutionize the health industry. You know, I just need that
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:05.100]   that's the ankle bear. Oh, it'd be awesome. So I'm ready for VR taste.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:13.740]   Yeah. But it would be, you know what? Our first prototypes were to have you eat kale and it would
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:18.220]   taste like ice cream. But then we thought, what if we were just to reprogram your mind so that you
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:23.180]   enjoy kale? Wouldn't that be even healthier? So yeah, maybe there's there's there are a lot of
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:30.940]   people I don't let inside my head. Well, for them are my older sisters and the others are tech CEOs.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.780]   I should mention that I did call out this this five nanometer article that Boy Genius reports
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:41.740]   flagged because it's because it's interesting. But we have to mention that this is really speculative
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:48.460]   on their part. It sort of makes sense that the manufacturer of Apple's mobile CPUs saying that,
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:52.860]   hey, we got we got this five nanometer technology that, hey, what would that mean if they were to
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:59.580]   put this technology in 2020 iPhones, but they are also making them for 5G hardware. So that's just
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:08.140]   speculative. This next one is a little more intriguing because it actually has the perfume of actual
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:16.860]   Apple involvement. The Twitter tipster, that makes it sounds like he's a drinker. So if I tipsy
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:22.300]   Twitter tipster, I vice universe who I'd never heard of never heard of this account.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:28.380]   It's a big Samsung leaker. Exactly. I later on learned these. He's got a okay track record
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:34.380]   and comes to like Samsung and panel displays says that Apple is talking to both Samsung and LG
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.500]   about whether it will be feasible to build OLED displays that have the same variable
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:46.860]   frame rate technology as found on the iPad Pro. The Pro motion 120 Hertz display and see if they
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:53.180]   can make that for 2020 iPhones. That's intriguing because when you increase the frame rate,
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:58.220]   it feels it's not necessarily more responsive, but boy, does it feel more responsive.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:04.540]   Laurie, what do you think about that? Have you used it? You have an iPad Pro and you've used
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:12.700]   it before. Yeah. Yeah. So with the iPad Pro, when it first came out, was it the year, the 10.5
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:20.220]   iPad Pro came out? Was that 2017? Yeah, I think so. It sure was an amazing
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:24.940]   changeover between, but when you put the two devices, one with it and one with outside by side,
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:30.380]   what an amazing difference it makes in the fluidity of what you're doing.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:36.140]   But it's so behind the scenes that if you're just using a device that has Pro motion technology,
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.380]   you don't notice it. It's just that it's just there and everything is just working. It's only
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:44.780]   when you kind of backward use a device that doesn't have it that you start to notice it.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.340]   The little things like when you're scrolling really fast and you get that sort of little bit of
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:55.340]   jitter on your phone, it sort of like almost blinks as you're scrolling fast, really scrolling
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:03.020]   really fast. That goes away with this type of hyper fluid sort of technology that kind of
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:09.580]   processes things on the screen super fast. The thing that I think makes what Apple does
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:14.860]   is very special and really unique and really helpful for especially the iPhone and might be
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:23.820]   why they hadn't implemented it yet. Increasing the gigahertz or the hertz up to 120, that's a power
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:32.780]   consumption. So Pro motion allows for that screen to go all the way up to 120 but also all the way
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:38.620]   down to 32. So if you're only looking at a picture on your screen, it's going to stay low and it's
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.340]   not going to use up so much power and it's not going to use up so much battery. If you're playing a
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:48.380]   fast graphics video game, it's going to skyrocket up to 120. It'll use it more battery but it's going
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:55.820]   to be a lot more fluid. So having the ability to sort of maintain a little bit of battery balance
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:00.300]   while also giving you the fluidity that comes from this kind of Pro motion technology.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:06.300]   In a phone, I'm absolutely loving the idea of this. I think it'll be a really great thing if
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:14.620]   they can pull this off. I think they're talking about using LED. Yeah, that's the LED panel.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.220]   So this could really be a good benefit and most of us aren't even going to really notice it unless
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:26.060]   we purposefully put two devices side by side one with and without. But the difference really is
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:36.860]   just this nice, almost massaging of your eyes. I mean, Renee, it's not going to make the thing
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:42.220]   go faster but when you spend a certain amount of money on a luxury car, the funk of the car door
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:47.420]   just going in with one base note really is very, very satisfying. This is kind of the same thing,
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:52.780]   isn't it? Yeah, I think is it the OnePlus Pro that's doing 90 Hertz right now? And I know that
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:59.260]   technology is tricky with OLED and maybe something else will fix that in future. The Razer 2 has
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:04.860]   120, I think, but I don't know if they have anything that's like Pro motion, which is again,
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:11.740]   let's ramp it up and down as necessary. Yeah, no, I think it's the Pro that has the
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:16.380]   90s, which is a good middle ground. But for gamers, love it because it's silky smooth frame rates,
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:21.260]   makes their games look great. On the iPad, it's great for Apple Pencil. And just like Laurie said,
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:26.540]   swiping between things is amazing. And once you see it on one device you want it everywhere,
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.500]   everything else suddenly looks slow and janky because human brains are terrible.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:35.020]   The retina effect. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Suddenly you see pixels you never saw before.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:41.340]   Why are there pixels? We were just talking about the local newscasters after
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:46.220]   everything went to 4K how many people were irritated because they realized they weren't as
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:53.340]   cute as they thought they were. I do love these little things and to go back to what Andy was
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:59.420]   talking about. One of the neat things and not a humble brag or anything, but I have an electric
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.860]   BMW was the i3. I just went back up to a 5 series because I looked like a circus clown in the i3.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:13.420]   And it's real tiny little subtle things. The guy who created the seat belt sound went through some
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:22.860]   2,000 iterations of a seat in various note forms to get a seat belt sound that will let you know,
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:30.860]   "Hey dummy, put on your seat belt," but not like yell at you. And I've gotten into other cars where
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:36.620]   their seat belt sound is like, "Dude, put on the seat belt." And it's like, "Whoa." And the BMW is like,
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.860]   "Listen idiot, for your own safety, please put on the seat belt." It's almost like his
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:46.860]   glory. It's like, yeah, it's like if the glory decided to seat belt sound on the BMW. It's very
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:52.620]   calming yet, dude, you know what I mean, get it done. And I appreciate that. And it's a small thing.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:59.340]   So for the screen on my iPad Pro, yes, I definitely do when you go back to a device that doesn't
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:04.060]   have it or you go back to a device, you know, like an older iPad and you're scrolling it,
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:09.180]   it does that little blinky thing. It definitely, you can feel it. So I would love it if they can
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:15.900]   squeeze this into an iPhone. Well, it's, yeah, especially when we, the things that we expect of
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:21.980]   iPhones, we expect them to be buttery smooth. We're not expecting to see a split second of
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:30.220]   hesitation anywhere. But let's get off of like a rumored hardware and talk about some rumored
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:39.500]   hardware. There is a digital times that Apple is might be talking with a main, one of their main
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:45.580]   iPhone census suppliers, actually an American company about providing a laser, a frickin laser
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:52.940]   beam for the 2020 iPhone, a VIXcel vertical cavity surface emitting laser. So this would be a laser
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:59.100]   on the back of the phone for that would do two things. Number one, you will make it give the
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.580]   the main camera the ability to focus really, really fast, even in low light, because it's
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:08.540]   getting distance information from a laser. And also because the laser is giving distance information,
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:13.340]   it will obviously be a big help in augmented reality to not have to mathematically calculate
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:18.540]   the distance between the geometry between two lenses to figure out how far away an object is.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:22.220]   You said it was for cavities. You just said it was for cavities, Andy, and now you're giving
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:28.780]   me a whole different story. It's only for cavities for naughty little children, good little children.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:38.220]   They don't get the laser beam in their mouth. So that's also interesting, again, it's saying
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:44.220]   that Apple is directly talking to these providers. So Fissin with AR, Fissin with cameras,
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:49.420]   let's just round things out that other things that we're expecting not in 2019 but 2020,
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:55.980]   we're certainly expecting at least one 5G iPhone in 2020. One of the reasons why the
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:00.060]   their relationship with Intel as a modem maker fell through is that Intel looked like they were
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:07.180]   not going to be able to ship 5G modem chips in time for a 2020 launch. And we're going to,
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:12.860]   are we going to guess that lightning ports are going to the land of ghosts and winds
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.940]   by 2020 and at least the premium phones will go USB-C? Does that sound fair to anybody?
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.820]   I want it last year maybe next year.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.020]   Maybe next year.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:23.020]   Okay.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:27.340]   Does this here sounds like, either give me coffee pouring out of the lightning port as a feature
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:32.140]   that USB-C cannot compete with or give me that USB-C port because I've seen the future and it's
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.060]   the files app and I just want my stuff.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.060]   I'm still thinking.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:42.380]   So I have a little altar, sorry, I have a little altar set up and it has my T-keys
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:48.940]   and my rabbit's feet and every other superstitionist thing that I can think of and there's a USB-C
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:55.180]   cable laying there and then there's an apple and I'm pleased, please, for the love of everything
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.300]   good with tech, please, can we get that USB-C? It would just make life so much better.
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.700]   I just bought last week.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.500]   Not for my parents.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.860]   I'm sorry, Lawrence.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.420]   Exactly.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:15.100]   It would for us because we have Max, we have things with USB-C but the iPhone is for way
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:22.460]   more people than just people like us who are all in on Apple and if my mom had a phone with USB-C,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.060]   she wouldn't know what to do with it.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.660]   So I don't think Apple's ready.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.700]   I don't think we're going to see a USB-C in 2020.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:33.180]   I think it's still going to take a little while and it's not because Apple's not ready to do it so
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:39.180]   much as I think it's more that the world is still not ready for all USB-C all the time.
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:46.380]   There's still so many things that are USB-A that it would actually be detrimental to some people or
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.940]   that's an exaggeration of the word but it would be difficult for some people to be able to transition
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:56.220]   over. In the same way, it was difficult for us to transition to USB-C.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:02.060]   There's still so many people who aren't ready for it yet so I'm okay with waiting a little bit
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:10.780]   longer until every until all computers have mostly USB-C ports until all external keyboards
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:17.420]   and USB drives, external drives, almost all of them are USB-C and it's harder to find them in USB-A
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:23.260]   form so that it's easier for people who use an iPhone to transition into that new way of doing
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:23.980]   plugging it in.
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:29.180]   I have a sweet solution for all of us. Just put the USB-C port on it and then ship the
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:34.060]   dongle like you did with the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and then put the dongle on the
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.340]   cord when you pull it out of the box and that way all our parents will just plug it in and
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.860]   not notice the difference and the rest of us can just pop off that little top and go "Ah!"
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:47.900]   Yes and I actually do have little dongles like that. The only thing I think about that Laurie is
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:53.660]   in the past Apple has always been first to just rip the band-aid on connectors
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:20:01.420]   and everyone else had to follow. USB itself like Apple was first with the Bondi iMac to
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:07.020]   get rid of the floppy drive, to get rid of the serial port, to get us to this USB thing
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.580]   and I remember the little keyspan adapters that everyone had to buy in order to work their kit.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:16.940]   So to me it's because they're somewhat late and the other people tend to use it
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:20.140]   as a feature to make us look dumb.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.180]   And it's not. It's just a connector. I mean most people are going to use it for charging.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:28.780]   Period point blank. Most people aren't going to use it for the other things in the accessories
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.700]   and stuff like that. Like you said, majority of the people simply use it for charging.
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:38.380]   So when the other manufacturers use it as a way of making us look sort of out of place,
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:44.620]   then I don't like that side of it. And I do think Renee's dongle solution is somewhat
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:51.260]   elegant because it would help the people that don't. But I also remember when we got lightning
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:57.580]   I remember the show specifically Leo had a meltdown because he said I have like 40 devices that
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:03.580]   use a 30-pin. This is outrageous. Called Tim in here right now. I want to go down the road
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:10.460]   and give him a good piece of my mind. And like after the lightning comes in and settles in,
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:14.860]   I don't even think he remembers having that meltdown. I almost want to look up the show number
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:20.780]   and then find that video clip to show you. He literally had a meltdown on Mac Drake Weekly
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:26.060]   and nobody even remembers 30-pin anymore. So at some point, we have to do it.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:32.380]   Well, I can say that, see, this is why Apple, they're always thinking and they have a plan for
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:37.340]   all of us. Those of us who are thinking, but look at all of the lightning cables that I have
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:42.860]   and have to replace all of them. This is why they designed those cables to basically biodegrade
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:49.340]   in air and so the coating completely falls apart within three months because you're always only
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:54.620]   two months away from replacing a cable anyway. Why not replace it with USB-C? We need to get to
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:59.900]   another ad, but let's before that, let's end with another group question. And this is a totally
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:06.860]   unfair one. This is terrible. I should not be asking this. Given that we know, we think we know
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:15.580]   so much about the 2019 iPhones. Let's point out that Forbes, senior contributor Owen Spence,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:21.980]   wrote about the rumors about the next iPhones. The article headline, "latest details highlight
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:27.500]   Apple's boring iPhone." It's a talk release. Is that acceptable?
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:38.860]   So we can charitably say we're expecting a talk release. And in 2020, even if only half of these
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:46.460]   rumors pan out. A lot of these make me think that if you can wait a year, if you don't really,
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:50.780]   really absolutely need to replace a phone, if the screen is intact, if you haven't dropped it in
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:59.260]   salt water or anything, maybe hold on to see what happens in 2020. Is this our arena place where
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:06.780]   we're kind of recommending people to wait and see because 2020 could be not just a tick release,
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:11.260]   but a tatatatatatatatatacamundo release.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:15.680]   This is my AM 1970s radio distribution--
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.160]   - The real speed on this is that we--
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.020]   - Dig a loop.
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.520]   - This is so common right now you see this
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.400]   on every channel, every site, it's going to be boring,
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.920]   skip it, but the thing that a lot of us forget,
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.460]   like the Compassion Valve turns off
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.500]   is that we are not normal people,
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.580]   we buy new phones every year and we can say,
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.220]   oh I bought the last 10 in a row, but I'm skipping this one.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.900]   But most people don't act like us.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.700]   We're a very special kind of nerd.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.140]   Most people buy a new phone every two to four years
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.780]   and even then maybe that new phone is a hand me down
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.140]   or an aftermarket phone.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.700]   We are very different from average consumers.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.900]   And for them, I remember last year people were saying,
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.180]   oh the iPhone XS, that's not a great upgrade from the 10.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.420]   And I was like, we never meant it to be.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.700]   The iPhone XS is meant for people who have a 6S,
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.540]   a 6, maybe a 6S.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.820]   And this year the 11 is going to be meant for people
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.780]   who have a 6S, maybe a 7.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.220]   And for them it's going to be a phenomenal update
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:08.300]   and maybe they don't care about a freaking laser beam
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.780]   on a 20/20 iPhone.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.140]   They just know that their iPhone is like reach the end
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.500]   of its life and they want some stuff
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:14.860]   and this is when they're going to buy
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.940]   and that's the iPhone they're going to buy.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.460]   So to me it's never like skip this year,
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.660]   wait for next year, it's like wait as long as you absolutely can,
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.180]   just wait as long as you can.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.460]   And then when you buy it, buy it and enjoy it
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.140]   because there will always be something next.
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.460]   - Yes.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.780]   - Yeah, and you're in this way.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.420]   - Lori, Lori is in the dock.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.060]   Renee is the voice of every man in this situation
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:39.340]   and I definitely think that we always need to consider
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.860]   that when we get on our little bubbles
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:43.860]   and forget that the world isn't quite the way we do things.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.420]   But hearing the things that are coming
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:51.180]   in the iPhone in 2020, this year for the first time
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:55.740]   I do kind of think, maybe I do just want to hold off
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.500]   and get that to, I might get them both anyway.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.220]   But I-
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.060]   (laughing)
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.940]   - The research purposes, your obligations to your readers,
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:05.940]   but the things that are coming out,
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:09.220]   and it's supposedly coming out in the 2020 iPhone
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.740]   are phenomenal.
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.620]   And I would even recommend to any friend
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:16.100]   that I have right now that if their phone is still ticking
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:19.980]   and they can still continue updating their operating system,
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:22.540]   I mean heck, even if you can't continue operating
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.020]   the updating your operating system like the iPhone SE
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:28.700]   but you like the phone, maybe hold off until 2020
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:32.380]   because that, there's so many big things coming with that
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:35.820]   that I'm more excited about next year's iPhone
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.460]   than I am about this year's iPhone.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.540]   And I'm not usually like that.
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.220]   I'm usually, even when it's the 10 to the 10S,
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.380]   even that was like, that's a big deal, I love it.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.180]   There's barely anything new, but I want it anyway.
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.420]   And in this case, I'm almost like,
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.540]   "Yes, so there's gonna be a new camera,
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.420]   "but what about the 2020 iPhone?"
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.740]   (laughing)
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.940]   - I don't know about laser.
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.740]   - Okay, so the only reason why,
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:04.740]   if these renders, the Sunny Dixon dummy phones are correct,
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:08.700]   looking at the models that have the three lenses on the back,
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.540]   being old, or sorry, of a certain vintage as Andy,
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:13.980]   you know, as we've repeated,
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.580]   I just want one for the fact that the back of the camera
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:23.500]   reminds me of when you used to watch Merv Griffin
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.980]   and they would pan it out and you would see
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.900]   like the old RCA TK-31s and the TK-30s.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:30.740]   (laughing)
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.860]   And that was in Giant's, see Andy laughs
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:36.380]   because he's old too, the giant camera with the three lenses
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.420]   because you need one for each color
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.460]   and it was the beginning of the little color TV thing
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.180]   on doo doo doo doo, NBC.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.140]   I appreciate that and I love that design element of it.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:48.460]   And probably for that alone, I won't.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.980]   Just because it reminds me of that I'm an old person
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:53.340]   with a nice piece of tech in my head.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.820]   But yeah, I agree with Renee,
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.500]   the average person does,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.100]   tend to hold on them longer.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.780]   And last year was the first year
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.820]   that I didn't get an iPhone.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:06.980]   Just randomly decided I didn't want one.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.140]   And I finally know what it feels like
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.460]   when people complained about battery life
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:12.980]   'cause I thought everyone was tripping.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.820]   That's because I always had a new phone.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:17.700]   But the year after, oh, it starts to get horrible
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.700]   towards the end.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.540]   So right now my phone is slightly angry at, you know,
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.420]   about 85% life.
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.220]   So yeah, I have to get one anyway,
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.580]   but if that wasn't the case,
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.660]   I still would probably buy one.
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.500]   - Yeah.
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.380]   Now, and Renee, I'm a mutant among mutants
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:38.380]   because this is my, okay, avert your eyes.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:39.540]   It is an Android phone.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.420]   But this is a Google picture.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:43.220]   - I have one on a shelf right there.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.060]   (laughing)
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:45.900]   - And I have the two.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.340]   I'm fat as you are.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.740]   - Yeah, no, but it's a C.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.860]   But every, I have to remind myself sometimes,
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.900]   I'm sure you guys are in this position too,
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.100]   where it's like, oh, wow, I really wanna get the new phone.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:00.020]   Like Andy, what do you keep telling people
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.800]   about buying new hardware?
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:07.340]   If it doesn't solve a problem or create an opportunity,
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.540]   it's probably not worth upgrading.
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:12.020]   But it's so shiny and it's new.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:15.220]   But so I have the model one,
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:19.820]   the Pixel 2 didn't really seem all that much better to me.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:23.380]   The Pixel 3 intriguing, but not all that much better.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:27.260]   And now it's gonna be between either the Pixel 4 this year
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.260]   or the new iPhone next year,
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.380]   both of which seem as though, wow,
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.220]   they could be.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:33.200]   (laughing)
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.180]   Yes.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.860]   So yeah, I mean, I really do think that
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.220]   if so long as the screen's not broken,
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.580]   so long as like you've still got enough storage
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.620]   to do what you wanna do,
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:45.140]   so long as you don't look at the brand new phone
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:49.180]   and think, wow, this new night site feature
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:53.340]   or this new 3D touch feature or this new whatever,
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.260]   this would solve, so make my life so much better
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.420]   because all the times I wasn't able to take a picture
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.220]   or all the times I couldn't really fumble with this
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.980]   on the cold or something like that.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.620]   So yeah, I'm glad that more people are thinking
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:05.980]   that their default position should be,
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.820]   I'm not gonna buy the new phone until again,
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:13.500]   there's a toilet electrical interlude
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:17.340]   and that it negatively impacts the performance
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.580]   of this device.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.460]   We'll gonna be back after this next message
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.700]   from our good close personal friend, Leo LaPorte.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:28.460]   If I may, you guys seem like you could use a little
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:31.580]   calm.com, hi, it's Leo here,
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.180]   telling you about our sponsor Calm.

[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.220]   And if you're not sleeping enough,
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.420]   man, the next day your brain isn't working,
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:51.700]   you're not feeling good, you're tired, but you can't sleep.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:54.940]   And all your cognitive functions are impaired,
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:58.300]   problem solving, decision making, it's just not good.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.740]   That's why you need Calm.

[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.180]   and think of his meditation app
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.980]   and it is that the daily meditations

[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.780]   The sleepless are more prone to accidents,
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.860]   weight gain, depression.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:23.300]   Don't let your sleepless nights

[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:34.500]   I actually use the soundscapes for work too,
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.700]   they help me focus.
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.340]   Over 100 sleep stories, I love these.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:39.740]   You like having a bedtime story?
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.820]   Imagine Jerome Flynn from Game of Thrones
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:46.140]   or Stephen Fry or Matthew McConaughey reading to you.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.940]   It's so relaxing, it's so nice.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:51.020]   I love these sleep stories, plus I learn a lot from them.

[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.420]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.500]   There's all big business news yesterday.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.780]   Apple, according to Wall Street Journal,
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.860]   the Apple is in deep, deep, deep, deep,
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:39.940]   deeply along talks to buy out Intel's entire 5G modem
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.580]   business for about a billion dollars
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.820]   is the number being floated around
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.100]   and this would include,
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.220]   they're gonna get all of Intel's modem patents.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:49.340]   There's gonna be transfer of a great number of workers
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:52.380]   and personnel, so basically their entire German operation
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.700]   for building 5G modems would then belong to Apple.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.180]   That kinda makes sense because
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:04.740]   although Intel was disappointing Apple, mightily,
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:08.500]   they were disappointing Apple specifically.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.860]   So they were disappointing Apple
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.900]   according to their needs and their terms.
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.780]   So you would think that whatever work
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.660]   that they had been doing on 5G would be
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.420]   very, very good fit for Apple.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:20.860]   Also, having read most of the court documents
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:24.220]   of the Apple versus Qualcomm lawsuit,
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:27.380]   I would think that Apple would like to manufacture
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:31.660]   its own 5G chips if only despite Qualcomm.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.700]   Although the face that they would probably put on it
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.420]   is that they were Apple, we like to build everything.
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.300]   We don't like to rely on outside parties
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.580]   to make anything for us.
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.020]   Renee, does that seem to make sense?
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.860]   - Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are saying,
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.220]   oh, I hope Apple makes their own modems
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:47.260]   'cause it'll save us money.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.220]   But quite often when you can buy a generic modem
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:52.740]   from Qualcomm, that's the path of least payment.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.620]   But what is super interesting about this is that Qualcomm,
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.980]   they can put the SOC, they can put the chipset
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.100]   with the modem and make it a single unit.
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:02.260]   And there can be efficiencies in that.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.020]   But beyond that, Qualcomm just doesn't have the money
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.380]   to make anything that's not supremely popular.
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.900]   We've seen them struggle to make smartwatch chips,
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:11.860]   for example, because there's not a huge amount
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.980]   of customers for it.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.840]   So it's like a chicken and an egg problem,
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.860]   but Apple does not do profit and loss
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.220]   on the component level.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.400]   So they would love, and it's probably gonna be similar
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.280]   to ARM where they bought PA Semi, got the ARM IP license
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.780]   and then made custom chips.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:30.060]   They'll buy IBM's Infineon business,
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.560]   and they've already got the Qualcomm IP license.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.820]   It was part of the settlement,
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   and then start making their own custom modems.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:39.740]   And that's maybe five years away, especially for 5G.
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:42.780]   5G right now is not very good, so we don't really care.
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.420]   But the idea is not just iPhones.
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:47.800]   iPhones is like the common ground, and even iPads.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.760]   But if you can start putting them in watches
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.520]   and in ear pods, which there's no business
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.240]   for Qualcomm doing that, but Apple could do that,
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.760]   and then Doc Rock would have his ear pods
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.760]   and not have to take his iPhone or watch with them.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.320]   And that starts to get really exciting
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.560]   as we get into glasses and all that territory.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.600]   - And the great thing about 5G chip and mobile
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.280]   is that you could just, if Doc could basically take
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:13.800]   one of his ear pods out, put it on like a nice piece of pork
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.980]   or a steak and make a couple of calls and boom,
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:19.060]   it would like flash fry that nice thing.
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:20.900]   Now you don't want to have the thing in your ear
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.460]   when you're getting a phone call.
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.420]   But yeah, no, I definitely see that.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:28.860]   Would you like to have like a 5G ear thermometer
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:32.240]   that's more of a temperature positive interaction?
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.300]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:37.180]   I would love it if I could put a 5G chip
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:40.500]   in my ear, air pods.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.340]   English, Mr. Rock.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:45.340]   - Yeah, I would absolutely love that because again,
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.500]   you could get further away from your phone.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.380]   A lot of times when I'm working in the workshop,
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.580]   I am using them as part ear protection,
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:54.900]   part distract me from being bored
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.620]   while I am standing for days.
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.180]   So I would absolutely appreciate other places
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.780]   where you could stick in a 5G chip.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.500]   And I see more and more cars are coming
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.260]   where your car is a hot spot.
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.340]   So we are going to see more and more sort of connected
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:10.340]   devices like that.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.820]   But I think the one advantage too of Apple having
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:18.740]   all of this is in hand is they have better control
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.700]   and that last minute pivots.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.820]   When there's something changes and they want to,
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.900]   you know, do it right away,
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:25.660]   they don't have to go through 80 different hoops
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.740]   to get that done.
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.820]   They can just yell across the circular campus
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.420]   and be like, "Hey guys, down there in the Intel modem
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:35.860]   division, fix this or change that or make them purple."
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:37.060]   And I like that.
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:37.900]   I like that.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.700]   (laughing)
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:43.340]   It makes so much sense to just kind of get,
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:45.460]   go all in Intel was saying that, you know,
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:49.940]   it's intensive, and it uses too much resources for them
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:52.060]   to try to get to the 5G they're not ready for it.
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:53.660]   So they were going to stop doing it.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.460]   So, you know, Apple has practically unlimited resources.
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:03.260]   They can invest a lot in Intel's modem department
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.220]   to really just ramp up everything they want
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:06.460]   specifically for themselves.
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.900]   It's not, you know, participating in a company
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.860]   that's also making chips for all of the Windows computers
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:14.100]   in the world and, you know, all of the other phones,
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.020]   they get sort of almost this sort of exclusivity
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:20.420]   and like, you're going to help us get where we want to go
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:22.100]   and we're going to be sort of in charge
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.380]   of making sure that this happens
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:24.900]   and we're going to throw all the money at it
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.660]   so that when it's ready, it's the best,
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:31.380]   it's what we wanted, it's designed exactly the way we want.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:34.060]   It really just makes sense that Apple would try
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:36.820]   to make a move like this to be more in control
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:40.620]   of the chip modem of the future, you know.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.740]   - Yeah, the timing seems pretty good too.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.420]   The part of the Qualcomm settlement
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.620]   or at least the announcements being made
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.060]   about the settlement was that Apple was contracting
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:52.460]   to buy Qualcomm modems, 5G modems for the next few years.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.020]   But I think I made the joke that now we know exactly
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.620]   how long Apple thinks it would take for them
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:58.540]   to figure out how to make their own 5G modems.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.620]   It's exactly the term in which they've agreed
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.620]   to buy these Qualcomm chips.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:06.660]   And 5G is, it's not going to be like this switch
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.580]   from like 3G to LTE.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:11.700]   This is a really, really big, tricky deal.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.940]   And it really is going to be a few years
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.940]   before I think it becomes ubiquitous somewhere.
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:18.620]   It's a service that you're kind of expecting to find
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:22.260]   in your community and a chipset or set of antennas
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.140]   you're expecting to see in your phone.
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:26.740]   So by the time it becomes a really important thing,
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.220]   not just a luxury sort of designation
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:31.940]   for your highest end phone, Apple will be making
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:35.900]   not just 5G chips, but 5G that is integrated fully
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:40.500]   into absolutely everything that the iPhone is all about.
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:44.100]   Mark Gurman over at Bloomberg did a really long,
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:46.620]   interesting profile about Apple senior vice president,
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:51.620]   Jeff Williams, that seems a lot like he's nominating him
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.540]   for presidential candidacy for some party.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:01.340]   I mean, Jeff Williams does a lot of operations.
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:03.300]   He is in charge of the Apple Watch.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.900]   He's in charge of a lot of other things at Apple.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.540]   But a lot of this content is really about how
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:13.540]   he seems to be the heir apparent to Tim Cook.
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:16.100]   I pulled out a couple of quotes here.
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:19.780]   Jeff is a former Apple executives
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.020]   that are growing unnamed and anonymous.
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:25.460]   "Jeff is 95% operations and 5% product."
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.700]   Says someone who knows him, quote,
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.940]   "Apple has become an operations company.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.260]   "He's the closest thing at the company to Tim Cook
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:32.980]   "and you'll get more of that.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:34.620]   "If you think Cook is doing a good job,
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.900]   "then it's a good choice."
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.540]   So he's in charge of all of Apple's hardware development
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:40.900]   and design.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.700]   He does the weekly meeting in which you basically
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.940]   bend the knee to senior Apple management
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.660]   about this project that you're doing.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:52.180]   The weekly review meeting they say in the report
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:54.460]   is formally called a, quote, "new product review,"
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.300]   and quote, "but some employees refer to it
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:59.260]   "as the, quote, Jeff review, as it is he,
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.860]   "who they need to impress."
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.260]   So it's interesting that this article
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:06.540]   would happen at this time.
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.060]   If it worked, Mark Gurman, I'd be wondering if,
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:13.020]   given that we're one week away from Apple's
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.300]   quarterly results call, I think,
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.660]   that is this something that Apple would,
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.660]   Apple PR would like to put out there
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.780]   in case people are worrying,
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.660]   well, what happens when Tim Cook goes away?
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:26.280]   Is there someone who is being groomed to take his place?
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.700]   I don't know if I'm being a little bit too cynical there,
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:32.780]   but Laurie, did you read it?
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:36.220]   And what do you think about this line of secession
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:39.740]   that seems to be, like, being set up?
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.660]   - It's, you know, you could take that
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.860]   a couple of different ways.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:46.780]   It could just be, you know, a profile piece on, you know,
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.940]   a higher up at Apple.
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:52.180]   I think that it's not uncommon to have profiles
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:54.540]   on different types of people.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:58.400]   It is, like you're saying, it's sort of nicely placed
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.520]   that it's coming up right as, like a week ahead
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.520]   of Apple's earnings report.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.440]   Sort of, especially right after Johnny Ives left,
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.640]   it's sort of solidifying for Apple
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.040]   that there are people that are under control and in charge
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.040]   and not just, it's not just Tim Cook
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.560]   and a bunch of people who don't know what they're doing.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.680]   There's lots of people down the line
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.600]   that are also just as important.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   So, you know, it's all of that.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.500]   It's all of the above, you know.
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.660]   It makes sense.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:33.460]   There's always, especially, you know,
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.660]   in the Wall Street Journal, they, you know,
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:39.900]   they do profile pieces on, on exacts and stuff like that
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:40.740]   all the time.
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.080]   So this coming out doesn't seem unusual.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.840]   Perfectly positioned for right ahead
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.880]   of the Apple earnings call, I think,
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.460]   it, I don't think it means anything.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:52.780]   I think it's just something for us
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.360]   to kind of speculate on it.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.960]   In the end, it probably doesn't mean much
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.960]   of anything at all.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.080]   - Well, we don't get paid for just saying, okay.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:02.920]   Let's get it.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.840]   (laughing)
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.800]   - The amazing thing to me is that like,
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.400]   the minute Tim Cook became CEO,
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:12.240]   they had a person waiting to replace Tim Cook
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.720]   'cause that's one of the sole responsibilities of the board
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.200]   is to make sure there's succession.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.600]   And I remember there's a story inside Apple of Steve Jobs
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.040]   saying, "Tim, you've got to go to marketing
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.120]   "and work there for well."
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:23.240]   Tim went, "I don't wanna."
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.900]   He goes, "No, you're gonna run this company one day.
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:27.940]   "You've got to understand all the pieces work.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.280]   "You're going down to marketing."
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.020]   And him sort of really not liking it,
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.820]   but going there and spending his time.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.180]   And the minute Jeff Williams was given Apple watch,
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:37.880]   he is, if Tim Cook gets hit by a bus,
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.820]   this is a person that you're all gonna go to
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:42.000]   until he figured something else out.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.660]   But it's only since Johnny left that I think mainstream media
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.780]   has sort of gushed on to Jeff Williams.
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:48.980]   Anyone who follows Apple day to day,
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:49.940]   this is not news.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:52.640]   It hasn't been used in five or six years.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.300]   But just like we're seeing all these profiles,
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:56.320]   like people who really don't know Jeff
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.680]   are doing all these profiles all of a sudden.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.680]   First, they were incredibly wrong about Jeff.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.760]   And now they're like,
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.640]   "Oh, maybe we were incredibly wrong about him."
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.200]   And then it's like, "Oh, Jeff is no Johnny.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.080]   "He'll be able to do this."
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.280]   And it's like, "Oh, no, Johnny made gold watches
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.680]   "and Jeff made sports watches.
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:11.880]   "And maybe he's way more."
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.240]   And it's just, it's so scatter shot and all over the place.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.280]   And I think we're just gonna have to wait a couple of years
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.300]   and see how the person does with all the gold.
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.460]   Jeff does with all the products.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:23.800]   Current and future.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:26.940]   - Doc, what do you think of new dad?
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.020]   - I'm just gonna urge,
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:31.180]   I'm just gonna try to urge some brownie points
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:33.220]   with all of our female listeners.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:34.740]   I'm voting for Katie Cotton.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.220]   (laughing)
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:42.220]   Okay, I mean, Renee's 100% right.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:45.420]   The minute one CEO takes over the reins,
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:48.680]   they already have the air apparent.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.280]   The funny part is reading these docs.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.520]   I keep wanting to read it as hair apparent.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.000]   And I'm like, "What's Federally gonna do any of this?"
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.840]   - Yeah, what a problem.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:57.680]   (laughing)
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.680]   - But no, and so it is somewhat of a non-story
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.720]   in the fact that every company has succession plans
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.880]   and they kinda sort of know what's gonna go on.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:12.920]   But as any event, things change.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.740]   The industry climate might change.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.100]   Apple being more service oriented might change some things.
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:24.240]   So there may be room and a place for a different person.
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:27.180]   So although he might be,
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:29.340]   Williams might be the first person in line,
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:30.900]   they probably have others in place.
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:34.580]   And should the course correction require such?
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:36.320]   And, you know, Siri says,
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.180]   "Hey, turn left at the next corner."
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:41.180]   They also know that maybe it's Cotton
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:44.140]   or maybe it's Q or maybe it's,
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:47.420]   I forget, at least his last name, the EPA lady.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:51.940]   Yes, so it doesn't matter until Tim says,
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.020]   "Okay, I'm done.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.700]   I'm gonna go live in Hawaii
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:57.060]   and I just got a new condo in Doc's building."
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:57.900]   - I got with Doc.
[01:43:57.900 --> 01:43:58.900]   (laughing)
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:43:59.740]   - Yeah.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:01.220]   - Yeah, I got with Tim.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.620]   I gotta fix his mind.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:05.220]   - I would watch that on Apple TV Plus in a heartbeat.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.020]   (laughing)
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:11.100]   - Jeff Williams was asked to leave his company.
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.820]   That came from his CEO.
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:17.740]   He asked his friend Doc to move in with him.
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.460]   And two nerds with a mutual collection of iPhones
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:24.540]   and not Mac devices get along.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.740]   (humming)
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:29.340]   So there's,
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:35.140]   if people are kind of like having a facial tick
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.980]   over the idea that he's a very Tim Cook sort of person,
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.620]   realize that Apple has a very homogenous
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:45.100]   sort of culture, particularly in the upper management area.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:49.940]   And which you kind of go to Apple business school,
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.780]   actually, that's almost literally true,
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.260]   where they're not gonna,
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:58.260]   you will not make it to that level in the executive suites
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:01.460]   by being a maverick who decides that we need to make
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:02.660]   sportswear.
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:05.500]   We suddenly need to pivot towards sportswear
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.780]   and luxury shoes.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.340]   You have to, basically, there's, a session is,
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:14.660]   is handing off of not just a duty and a title,
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.420]   but also a way of doing things at Apple.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:22.100]   So it's not really a problem that you're not gonna get this,
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.540]   a firebrand maverick person who's gonna change everything
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.740]   at Apple, given that Tim is,
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:29.420]   when he does decide to hand over the reins,
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:31.900]   he will be hand over the reins of a very successful company
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:36.580]   unless he, boy, if he gets a really bad drinking problem
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:40.100]   really quickly, and also is really good at making
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.020]   exactly not just random decisions,
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:44.180]   but the worst decision possible,
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.860]   then maybe he will hand over only a $300 billion company.
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:53.860]   So it's interesting trivia to see this sort of stuff.
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:58.900]   Also interesting trivia is that this Mark Grumman article
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.940]   came up with a couple of interesting behind the scenes
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:04.860]   stories about the development of Apple Watch,
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:07.260]   given that the man is in charge of Apple Watch.
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:10.540]   He tells a story about how they discovered that
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:13.820]   because of nickel as being part of the metal
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.060]   in the Apple Watch cases, it was causing allergic reactions
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.300]   and some of the people who are testing out.
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:21.580]   And so he basically, and so he made the decision,
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.780]   that, okay, we gotta pull all of these watches.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.900]   This is one of the reasons why they were in such short supply
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:29.220]   because they basically took all of these huge piles
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:31.900]   of manufactured watches and decided not to put them
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:32.740]   on the market.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.140]   The article says that they decided to give them
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:36.180]   to employees instead.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:38.780]   I don't know how good you might have felt as an employee
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:40.860]   to say, thank you for giving me the poison sumac
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.780]   infested Apple Watch.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:44.460]   That's 15 years from the company.
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.620]   Okay, that's really, really nice.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:50.700]   But it does show that as much as we think that,
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.620]   oh, well, this is a huge Apple company.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.740]   They've got everything going right.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:58.900]   If there's lower demand, if they don't have enough product,
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:01.300]   it's because people are buying them way, way too fast.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.340]   Well, sometimes bad things happen
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.740]   and they don't issue a press release saying that,
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:07.820]   we had a whole bunch of people over here
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:10.500]   in Cupertino who broke out in a wrist hive
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:14.300]   and we decided not to, we didn't want that PR hit ourselves.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:17.740]   One thing that, now I will say that,
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:20.460]   I think that the gold Apple Watch,
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:23.660]   the was one of the dumbest things,
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:26.060]   not certainly the most embarrassing and dumb thing
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:29.460]   that Apple has ever manufactured since the Steve Jobs era.
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:32.340]   I put it in a debate with my friends
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.820]   that is possibly the dumbest tech product ever made
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.940]   with a serious intent to make it a success.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:41.700]   The counter argument was the friend made was Google Glass.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.100]   I think there were arguments to be made on both sides,
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.460]   but I was very, very glad to,
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:49.540]   in a way that I'm not proud of,
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:51.380]   that it burned and failed.
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:53.340]   The same Mark Grim report said that sales
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.340]   of the 18-carat gold edition were, quote,
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.460]   "in the low tens of thousands
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:02.500]   "and they were pretty much down to zero sales after two weeks,"
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.500]   which is why you didn't really have to wait that long.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.500]   - That was 5% of the market, which was scary.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.260]   - That's true, yeah, 18.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.020]   Also, if you, low tens of thousands
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:14.260]   is impressive just in numbers with the rest of the market.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:16.220]   And then when you realize that that was low tens
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:19.340]   of thousands times $12,000 per watch,
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:21.300]   as sales users go--
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.660]   - That's a super happy amount of that market.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:25.620]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.540]   I could still go to my high school reunion
[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.020]   with my head-held high if I said,
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:33.020]   "Oh yeah, my failed product that only netted $1.8 million
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.660]   "for the company,"
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:36.980]   and kept our chief designer happy
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:40.580]   and in his office for at least three more years.
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.300]   Well, we probably should get to picks of the week
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.300]   after another ad, but we've been,
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:48.300]   I've been ending each one of these acts
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:51.060]   with a group discussion that's related directly
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:52.820]   to the top that we've been discussing.
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:56.340]   And so before we go, last topic for group discussion,
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.100]   who saw the new Comic-Con Picard teaser trailer
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.620]   and how awesome do we all think it was Renee?
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:03.940]   - It's so great.
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:04.780]   - I can't believe it.
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:06.260]   - So great, so great.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:08.420]   The only thing I hated was the 2020 on it,
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.740]   'cause I want it like tomorrow.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:12.180]   I wanna start watching that show immediately,
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:15.060]   but he looks phenomenal and you see like,
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:16.260]   I don't wanna spoil him,
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.340]   I hasn't seen the trailer yet,
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.740]   but there's like other characters,
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:21.380]   even from other star tracks that are involved in it,
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.700]   and it looks gorgeous and they're setting it up
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.940]   in a very, very interesting way.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:29.020]   And it just feels like the star trek you remember,
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:30.900]   but thinking the next step forward
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.820]   and after years and years of prequels,
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.420]   I'm so ready for them to just keep going.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.780]   Yes, I don't.
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:38.100]   - Yeah.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.860]   - Go ahead, Laurie.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.780]   - It does look really exciting.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:47.020]   I love Star Trek and I call myself a Star Wars fan
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.540]   and I actually watch Star Trek way more often
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:51.100]   than I watch Star Wars.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.540]   And just seeing some of the characters
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:58.140]   that we get to see on screen again,
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.860]   hearing those voices that we recognize so well,
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:01.700]   popping up on the side,
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:04.020]   I'm getting chills just thinking about it.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:06.580]   I love this idea of moving forward
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:11.540]   with this very familiar Star Trek story
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:13.460]   that we've loved so much.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:17.420]   Yeah, I think, just like Renee,
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:20.900]   2020 won't come soon enough when it comes to the card.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.140]   It looks pretty phenomenal.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:26.100]   - I'm definitely not buying the 2019 Star Trek, okay?
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.540]   I know they've got, okay,
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:29.780]   I'm definitely waiting for the 2020 model.
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:31.540]   - Michael Burnham says, "Hey."
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.780]   (laughing)
[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:37.980]   - Yeah, I think, I will just end it by saying that,
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:40.900]   and this is not, I don't mean to denigrate previous Trek.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.540]   I'm just saying that I'm used to
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.740]   even the next generation being done on a certain budget
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.700]   and with a certain cheesiness in regards to sets and props
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.940]   and even when they made the feature films,
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.980]   it was like, well, I know that we've got a feature film budget
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.860]   and we're gonna be charging people 10 bucks a whack
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:01.260]   to see this, but why don't we just take the same cardboard
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:04.340]   and Bondo props that we made for low definition television
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:06.580]   and just throw it on the 70 millimeter screen.
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:11.580]   I am not used to, you have actors who are absolutely
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:17.780]   70 millimeter wide screen theatrical release good actors.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:21.940]   I'm not used, it was so pleasurable in addition to everything else
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:26.700]   to see Patrick Stewart in a real movie playing that character
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:31.060]   with real sets and real effects as opposed to,
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:33.740]   hey, I'm not gonna go, I'm not gonna do that,
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:36.140]   but there's nothing about this I don't love.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:38.340]   And I'm, Laurie, I'm pretty much like you.
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:43.180]   I'm primarily, I feel like I was raised
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:47.020]   in the religion of the Holy Trinity of Star Wars,
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.340]   but I married someone, I didn't actually marry,
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:51.380]   but I was saying, but imagine that you married someone
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:55.540]   who was a Trekkie and so you found a lot to enjoy
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:58.620]   from that faith as well and you're proud to raise your children
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.580]   as a conjoined household like that.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:04.620]   But I'm probably as excited.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.340]   Probably as excited about this one, go.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:08.780]   - You have to remember people like us,
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:11.020]   we had Star Trek first, right?
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.980]   Star Wars is 77, right?
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:15.860]   So we had Star Trek first and I,
[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:19.580]   - As a person, as a person with Jean-Lucie
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:24.300]   and hair follicles, I am absolutely ready for this.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:27.860]   And another thing that just really, really excites me
[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:31.540]   is one of my greatest memories from the aforementioned
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:35.100]   Mackerel, let's all pour out a little for Mackerel,
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:38.620]   is when I first met Rod Roddenberry
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.340]   and I got to talk to him, I was like, bro,
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:44.500]   you do not know how much your dad meant to kids like us.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:47.700]   And at that time, he was just starting to meet the community.
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.380]   He was just starting to come to grips
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.620]   with what his father really meant to a bunch of people.
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:53.300]   He didn't kind of start anew.
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:55.140]   He knew what his dad did, but that wasn't
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:56.340]   a huge part of his life.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:59.260]   So becoming friends with all of us Trekkies
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:02.540]   kind of blew his mind and yeah,
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:05.580]   again, the old school Trekkie and me loves it.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:08.940]   You know that Star Trek Live is happening
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.300]   very, very soon here in Vegas.
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:14.180]   So we're gonna see a lot more of this coming up
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:16.980]   in the next couple of weeks, especially with all the people
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:21.380]   that are making the annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:24.860]   So I'm gonna probably text Rod and tell him,
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:29.340]   just keep the pips nice and shiny for all of us.
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:32.660]   - Yep, also, I mean, again, Mackerel Expo,
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:33.980]   God rest his soul.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:37.260]   John DeLancy, who played Q, was a big Mac guy
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.180]   and he was always at Mackerel, always at parties,
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.700]   I know he's very approachable.
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   And I feel as though I showed a lot of maturity
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:49.940]   that even like the fourth or fifth time I met him,
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:53.180]   I didn't say, "Joo, what the double are you playing at?
[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:54.820]   "Retend my ship."
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:58.740]   Even though every time I wanted to do a scene with Q,
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:00.740]   but I didn't and now I'm actually kind of regretting
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.380]   that the last time I saw him at Mackerel was good.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:06.260]   Had I known, I would have definitely tried to do a scene
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:09.900]   with him and he would have chuckled very, very patiently
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:14.100]   before edging away to the Mackerel.
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.100]   We're gonna do one more ad and after that,
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.260]   we're gonna get to your picks of the week,
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:20.100]   but before those picks.
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:20.940]   - Thank you, Andy.

[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:02.740]   We're gonna start with picks of the week.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.940]   Lori, what have you got for us this week?
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:09.460]   - Well, I'm just gonna throw out this cute little thing
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.260]   that popped up a week or so ago.
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:17.860]   I'm a big fan of smart products for the home
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:21.740]   and one of the gateway smart products is a plug
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:23.380]   because you don't have to have a hub,
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:25.100]   you don't have to, you know,
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:27.700]   plug in these $75 lights and all that stuff.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.260]   It's just, it's just a plug and it turns anything smart.
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:35.580]   Your lamps and computers and coffee pots and everything.
[01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:37.740]   Satichi actually just recently,
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:42.100]   a couple of weeks ago launched a dual plug.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.060]   There's a couple of neat things about this one,
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:45.780]   the fact that it's two to go,
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:48.580]   that goes into your one plug so you get extra ports,
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.380]   which there's not a lot of smart plugs out there that do this.
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:54.900]   But this actually has, you can control it separately.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:59.460]   There are very few multi smart plug ports out there
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:03.020]   that let you say turn on plug one,
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:04.460]   but not turn on plug two.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:07.900]   Usually it's just an all on or all off thing.
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:09.380]   So this one's pretty exciting.
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:10.620]   I don't have one in hand yet,
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.580]   so I'm not sure how well it pairs
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:14.860]   with all of my smart home accessories,
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.260]   but I am gonna get one really soon.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:19.500]   And if you need me to tell you what I think of it,
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.060]   I'm sure I'm gonna have a review of it.
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.780]   So that's my thing of the week this week,
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:28.020]   just because if you haven't invested in anything smart home,
[01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:30.020]   but you're kind of on the edge
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:32.260]   and think maybe you wanna give it a try,
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:35.900]   a smart plug is the way to go because it doesn't cost much.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:39.340]   This one is a $60 one, obviously it's a little more expensive.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:40.660]   They put a little more effort into it,
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:42.020]   but you can get a super cheap one.
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:46.780]   I think Amazon makes a $20 one that it supports.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.260]   It doesn't have the home kit connection,
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.500]   but if you just wanna try it,
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.420]   smart plugs are the way to go with that kind of thing.
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:54.900]   So.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:56.180]   - Yeah, that's a good way to start
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:58.420]   and end home automation,
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:01.300]   because once you get, even when you get fully invested,
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:04.300]   now I've got like all my lights are like smart bulbs.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:07.260]   I've got like strips, I've got speakers everywhere.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.260]   And then you start to get really, really offended
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:13.300]   that like your ceiling fan,
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.660]   you have to actually get up and flip a switch to do it.
[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:18.180]   And so now you're turning off the power of the entire house,
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:19.740]   you can rewire the switch.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:20.580]   Yeah, so that's it.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:23.180]   So getting these smart plugs is gonna be a very, very positive thing
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.260]   in people's lives.
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:26.980]   - Excellent pick, Doc, what do you have for us?
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:31.980]   - Okay, so I have something that's known as a lit mobile power brick.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:36.460]   Now, what's really, really cool about this thing?
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:38.620]   And when I first, this came up,
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:41.060]   you know, Instagram has shopping now, right?
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:44.060]   So it popped up in my feed
[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:46.900]   and there may have been single malts involved,
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:47.740]   but I bought one.
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:49.340]   And I was like, that's really stupid.
[01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:50.460]   Why did you buy this?
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:52.060]   Well, the first thing it has
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:55.020]   is a really, really bright LED light
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.140]   that has like multiple do-
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:58.260]   - Like a light panel.
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:01.580]   - But here's where it gets interesting.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:05.060]   Slap the phone on it and put on it charges your phone.
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:05.900]   - Fireless.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:08.060]   - So if you're at the picnic and you know,
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.780]   you don't need the light just yet, but your phone needs a bump,
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:14.100]   you just lay it on the top and it will go ahead and charge your phone.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:18.060]   Now also in there, it has three USB ports
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:20.740]   for charging various other devices.
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:24.860]   And it is a 20,000 milliamp hour, you know,
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.900]   so you can charge three things and charge them a lot.
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:29.780]   But my favorite aspect of it,
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:33.740]   living here in the Honolulu, is it's solar powered.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.540]   So whenever you need to recharge it
[01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:37.820]   and you're out and about,
[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:39.980]   you're doing that, that hiking thing
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:42.060]   or just laying on the beach,
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.620]   you turn it this way up when you don't need the light
[01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:47.220]   or charge your phone and it will recharge itself.
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:50.180]   Incredibly, and I have no idea how they do it,
[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:52.900]   it recharges itself in a little over an hour.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:54.300]   Like it's kind of ridiculous.
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.140]   - Wow.
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:59.780]   - So 20,000 milliamp, I can't charge my 20,000 milliamp battery
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:01.620]   from AC in an hour.
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.620]   - Yeah, it's that sunlight.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:07.140]   It's that sunlight, it'll charge you up real fast.
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:11.020]   - Well especially here, we have, you know, our tangently,
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:12.820]   our sun rays are like direct, right?
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:16.060]   So Hawaii has really, really, really powerful sun.
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:18.460]   So your mileage may vary on the charging part,
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:20.580]   but here's the cool part.
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:23.100]   If you go there, and I believe Andy showed it,
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:25.660]   it says that it's 79.95.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:29.660]   Pop it in your cart and use this code, save 50.
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:31.980]   And the only reason why I know that is when I bought one,
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.940]   they said share this cart with your friend
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.460]   so they can buy one for 50% off.
[02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:39.260]   Well, all how many million of you guys watched with?
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:40.900]   You guys are now my friends,
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.340]   'cause it's a little hostile.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:45.340]   So a whole lit mobile don't get mad at me,
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:50.260]   but you save 50 and it'll come out to 39.98
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:52.180]   and just get one.
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:53.100]   It's incredible.
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:55.380]   And it's built like a tank, it's rubber.
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:57.740]   They do, if you're afraid of, you know,
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:59.340]   random companies you never heard of,
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:00.980]   there are about 90 different companies
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:02.940]   that make a similar thing on Amazon,
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:05.900]   but these guys were around the longest.
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.300]   So that's why I picked this one.
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:09.020]   And it is really a cool thing,
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:13.020]   especially if you are a traveler or outdoorsy type.
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:16.700]   Excellent, excellent pick.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:20.020]   And I have something similar and I also have
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:23.020]   a 20,000 milliamp hour battery that I just got last week.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.820]   Renee, if you want to spend the next two minutes
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:28.540]   choosing a power related pick to replace
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:30.060]   what you got in the show notes.
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:33.780]   So we get like the full four lemons here.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:36.940]   Yeah, I gave away my big, hung along
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:40.580]   the 20,000 milliamp hour battery as somebody,
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:43.300]   partly because the stranger really, really needed it
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.820]   on the train, but also because I knew that
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:48.180]   I was getting sick and tired of having
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:50.980]   a micro USB charged battery.
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:55.460]   I really needed something that had USB, USB-C instead.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:02:00.020]   So here you got your USB-C that can be used to charge it
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:04.020]   or discharge the battery or to charge other devices.
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:06.740]   It's also got two USB ports,
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:09.540]   but part of the magic of this device
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:11.940]   is what is inside the controller.
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:14.740]   So that number one, it's got enough juice
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:17.420]   and it's got the right wiring and protocols inside
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:21.820]   so that it can actually charge and power up many,
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:26.820]   not all, but many USB-C powered laptops.
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:30.660]   So it will charge a MacBook Pro,
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:33.660]   it will charge my Chromebook USB-C.
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:35.980]   That was one of the things I absolutely wanted to have
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:39.100]   'cause I was sick and tired of having to struggle with,
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:41.100]   like I got 4% left.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:43.300]   I'm hoping that I'm on one of the magic trains
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:46.740]   that the MBTA has that has the power plugs.
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:47.580]   No, I don't.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:50.060]   I've got the one that has the stupid blank sheet
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:52.700]   of aluminum stapled along those walls
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.060]   where the power plug should be
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:56.580]   and now I can't do anything with my computer
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:58.500]   for this hour long trip back.
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:01.180]   But it also has another really, really cool feature
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:05.460]   in that if you plug it in with USB-C
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:08.700]   and then it's got like many power banks,
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:10.420]   a button you click it on the side
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:14.060]   and we'll show you like what your chart level of charges.
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:16.940]   However, if you double click it, when it's plugged in,
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:19.660]   it actually will also turn into a USB hub.
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:21.780]   So these are not just like charging ports,
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:24.980]   they will also be like regular USB-A ports
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:29.980]   connected to your MacBook or your Chromebook.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:34.220]   And that's what absolutely positively sold it for me.
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.860]   They won't charge, they obviously won't charge as fast
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:38.540]   as they would if you would just had simply
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:40.540]   with charging only connected on it.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:44.420]   But yeah, if you have like your AirPods plugged in,
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.220]   it will also more slowly,
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:48.100]   but will still charge your phone off of that.
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:51.260]   But the number of times, even just in the past week and a half,
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:53.180]   where I'm like, ah, damn it, I don't have the right,
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:55.980]   oh, wait a minute, I can't connect my camera
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:04:01.340]   to my laptop because it turns out that this is also a USB hub.
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:03.660]   And for all that, it's not that expensive at all.
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:08.660]   It's called the ZMI, the ZMI USB PD backup battery and hub.
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:16.460]   Costs $55.95 on the website, that's ZMIUSA.com.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:18.820]   They will also give you a $5 credit
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:21.100]   because they have to charge you for shipping
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:22.540]   that knocks it down to $50.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:26.060]   If you buy it on Amazon, it's up to,
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:27.380]   you'll get it for 70.
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:29.380]   And I was super impatient and I actually,
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:31.140]   I wanted it in two days instead of a week.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.380]   So I bought it on Amazon.
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:33.540]   I'm very glad I did.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:35.580]   You also get, of course, little case for it
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:39.300]   and has a couple of USB cables on it.
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:40.900]   So very, very happy with it.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:44.380]   I'm hope the person who got my old battery
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.820]   is very happy with it as well,
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:49.300]   even though she thanked me profusely,
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.180]   but she was just a pawn in my little game of,
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:53.700]   well gosh, I need to replace that battery now, don't I?
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:55.060]   'Cause I can't go out one.
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.260]   I guess I'm just gonna have to have a super great upgrade
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:59.420]   to this old anchor battery that I had.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:03.620]   Okay, so we got three power related items in a row.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:06.620]   Renee, what do you got for your pick of the week?
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:08.940]   - So I got shamed, I got peer pressured,
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:11.820]   I got community actioned into changing mine.
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.740]   I decided to go with,
[02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:15.620]   I put a video in these show notes.
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:18.180]   And if you, this is a popular handsome
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:20.100]   and Star Trek obsessed YouTuber
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.860]   who took two ginormous power supplies,
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:27.940]   batteries, chargeables with him to a small island
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.180]   that disappears.
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:32.580]   It's off the coast of somewhere near Andy's probable house.
[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:34.460]   It disappears with a high tide.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:37.780]   And his only mission was to be able to deplete them
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:41.980]   before the tide came in and he lost his footing
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:43.420]   on this little island.
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:46.700]   So both of them are similar to each of their pros and cons
[02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:50.620]   and Michael Fisher, Mr. Mobile, goes through all of those.
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:53.620]   But basically they are ginormous batteries,
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:56.020]   they have USB-A, they have USB-C.
[02:05:56.020 --> 02:06:00.620]   I think only one of them has AC power if memory serves.
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:02.100]   And that's always a little bit fraught
[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:03.900]   because it has to internally convert to AC
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.100]   and then your device is probably
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.740]   just gonna convert it back to DC anyway.
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:09.460]   So it's not the most efficient way to charge.
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:12.580]   But if you just need something that only has AC power,
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:15.620]   it can be a lifesaver when you're in those situations.
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:18.260]   But if you decided that you absolutely do not want a battery
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.900]   that you can fit in a pocket,
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:22.820]   almost probably cannot fit in a backpack,
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.300]   but you wanna carry it around with you
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:27.700]   because you can't afford to go one of 14 days
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:30.540]   without charging your very hungry phone.
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:33.940]   Then check out his video and pick the one
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:35.580]   that is absolutely right for you.
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:39.220]   And now I feel like a good power charging citizen Andy.
[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:41.300]   - We're the four musketeers of power.
[02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:44.100]   Yeah, I'm not even joking here.
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:48.280]   I never feel as stress free or as like a
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:52.740]   undefeatable as when I go out of the house
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:55.380]   and I have a fully charged, really big battery.
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.100]   I know that I don't worry about finding an outlet for the phone.
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:00.140]   I don't have to worry about charging up the tablet
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.100]   or anything like that.
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.900]   And yeah, I would like to have one of those batteries
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.260]   you recommended that's about as big as a six pack
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:07.540]   or as big as a car battery.
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:08.380]   - Yes.
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:09.700]   (laughs)
[02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:11.380]   - Before we say goodbye, let's go around the horn
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:13.220]   and please everybody plug away.
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:15.900]   Let's hope everybody to find the wonderful work
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:20.260]   that you're doing outside of this podcast microphone.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.260]   - Renee, by any chance did you do any writing
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:25.780]   or any video making in the past week?
[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:27.820]   You could tell people about it.
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:31.540]   - Yeah, I did a quick story on the Apple ECG app
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:33.900]   six months later in a video just showing people
[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:36.740]   how to set it up, how to use it, where it is, how it works,
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:39.420]   what the restrictions are, what you can, can't do with it.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:41.900]   And I also did one, you know, kids these days,
[02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:44.900]   they'll know Lucifer from Netflix saying,
[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:46.700]   no Lieutenant, you're boring.
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:50.420]   But those of us, those vintage models as Doc would call us,
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:53.100]   we remember Willow from Buffy being bored now.
[02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:55.340]   So just sort of broke down the reasons why,
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:59.180]   not just the iPhone, but the Galaxy, the Moto, the Pixel,
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:01.900]   all of these phones tend to look very similar
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.260]   for year after year.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:04.900]   And it's not that they're not innovating,
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:06.620]   it's just that they're innovating in many ways
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:10.700]   that don't involve putting nodules and triangles
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:13.020]   and donut shape things on the fronts of your phones.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:16.540]   So all of that is up at youtube.com/vector.
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:18.300]   - Super duper.
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:21.460]   And Laurie Gill, where are you gigging
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.980]   or where are you writing right now?
[02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:26.540]   - I'm writing on iMore all the time.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:30.780]   We do have a show this Saturday night
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:34.420]   at our local cafe colonial.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.980]   And it's called the Speedfest.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:39.140]   So it's gonna be a bunch of bands playing a bunch of
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:41.060]   short sets of really fast music.
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:44.860]   So that's my this weekend with St. Bern, if anybody's in
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:47.220]   the greater Sacramento area and wants to come out.
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:50.660]   Otherwise head over to iMore and just look for me.
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.220]   I'm writing about smart things this week
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:54.500]   and Apple cards and fun things like that.
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:58.140]   - And Doc Rock, thank you so much for coming in
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:08:59.540]   and filling our MDC.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:01.620]   We've been doing, we've been doing the podcast together
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:03.980]   for a while on the British,
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:06.060]   used to be the British Mac network now they're calling
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:07.740]   themselves the British Tech Network,
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:10.100]   probably for tax purposes.
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:11.340]   I don't ask about it.
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:13.460]   We're just, you know, we're just hired hands.
[02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:16.460]   We're just, we're, you know, we're not even full time
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:17.300]   employees.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.940]   I'm so glad we got to do a show together.
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:24.540]   You know, that didn't involve my having to translate
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:27.980]   like naughty words in English and to naughty words in the UK.
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:31.060]   But where we're, we're, we're, we're, we're,
[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:33.620]   we're all scum people will see a redo experience you.
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:35.460]   Give you the love that you deserve.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:38.100]   - Well, first I will be taking a first round of funding
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:41.580]   for my new application, LG, not to be confused
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:44.380]   but lucky Gold Star but instead Lori Gill,
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.020]   Voice of Reason fact that LG, VOR.
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:50.900]   So I will be setting that up on Kickstarter very soon.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:53.140]   First of all, you can find me almost anywhere on the
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:56.860]   internet as D O C R O C K.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:59.940]   The extra K in the title there would mean I parked boats
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:01.060]   in my Ocolé.
[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:03.060]   Looked that word up in your Hawaiian dictionary
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:05.100]   and I do not park boats in my Ocolé.
[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:06.580]   I am yet a human being.
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:09.900]   Mostly you can find me again, all over the internet
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:11.180]   under that tag.
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:15.260]   And I am rededicated myself back to my YouTube channel
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:17.820]   and it's also YouTube.com/DockRock.
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:22.060]   And I get into tech, travel and lifestyle tips.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:24.780]   Sometimes it's reviews, sometimes it's just kind of
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:29.220]   showing you how to do odd things because I am an odd fellow.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:32.260]   So I really enjoy making YouTube videos
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:35.060]   and I hadn't neglected it for a while.
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.940]   So I decided I want to dive back into the YouTube thing
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:39.980]   because I really hate everyone thinking that
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:42.940]   YouTubers are just like teen angst.
[02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:47.700]   There are some of us plus 50 angst people out there
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:51.060]   that are maybe 50 plus 50 in age but still yet
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:52.380]   teenager in the brain.
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:56.700]   So I love to create videos and now that I'm traveling a lot,
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:00.260]   I want to be able to share my tech style with how you can
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:03.940]   travel better or just do things in and around the house better.
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:08.020]   And yeah, it's been a great honor to be here.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:09.140]   Andy, I love working with you.
[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:10.580]   You always crack me up.
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:14.540]   And it's good to be near the last time I saw Renee in the flesh
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:19.300]   was the aforementioned Mac world back in like 2014.
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:20.700]   And she's no longer with it.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:21.940]   - Quaring it out again.
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:23.860]   Anna, Anna, Kevin.
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.700]   - Anna, great.
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:25.540]   It's really, really great.
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:27.580]   Thanks, Laurie, for being my voice for a reason.
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:30.420]   I will be hitting you up with a friendie very soon.
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:32.020]   (laughing)
[02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:33.100]   - Sounds good.
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:33.940]   - Yeah.
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:35.180]   And I am Andy Anaco.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:38.060]   If you can spell my last name, you've won up on me
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.060]   from age four to 17.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.300]   But I'm an apo on Instagram, an apo on Twitter.
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:46.340]   I've also got a blog at anaco.com, largely neglected,
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:49.300]   but very, very much loved despite the neglect.
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:52.620]   But if I'm also the tech contributor to WGBH Boston
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:57.620]   public radio, my next thing is going to be on Friday.
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:00.980]   And I think it's at the 12, I'll check out Twitter
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:01.820]   for the actual time.
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:04.060]   It's 1230 to one.
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:05.500]   But if you're in the Boston area,
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:10.220]   go, we're doing it from the WGBH NPR studios
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:11.580]   at the Boston Public Library.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.180]   And it's in a coffee shop and everything.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:15.980]   So get yourself a cookie, get yourself a fresco,
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:18.220]   sit down and watch me just to calculate with my hands,
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:21.140]   even though I know that there's no cameras involved anywhere.
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:25.140]   But that's going to do it for us for this week.
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:28.660]   Hope you enjoyed it as much as we have had,
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:30.300]   much more as we've had doing this.
[02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:32.220]   But unfortunately, fun time is over.
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:35.220]   Get back to work, break time is over.
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:37.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:46.800]   (upbeat music)
