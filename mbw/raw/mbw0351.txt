[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers your apple
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   and Macintosh needs.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   Starting if you're watching live a little late because of the Xbox
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   One announcement, Microsoft's announcement of their new
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   Xbox console sometime later this year, and we covered that live.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   But it's time to Mac Break, starting with Andy Inako
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   and his friend Dennis Hopper from beautiful Massachusetts.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   I thought that we're going to be heading far upriver today
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   because I saw the show notes and we're going to be talking
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   about taxes and tax law and international movement.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   And so I think that I've got to see the circles, man.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   It's all about rings.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   The heart.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   That's a great picture.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   That's from Apocalypse Now.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   That's great.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   That's from Apocalypse Now.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   Also, he's wearing some really cool gear, which he probably was
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   too stoned to understand how cool the cameras to his wearing was
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   where.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   [laughter]
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Also here.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Great to have you, Alex Lindsay, back from his travels.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   Good to be here.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   You see you.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   Welcome.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   From Pixel Core.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Also here, Renee Ritchie, back to Montreal for him.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   5.5% tax.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   I returned to the US, Leo.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   I'm trying to get Congress to change that form.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   There's a limited amount of number of times you can come here
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   before we start thinking of you as one of ours.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   I'll be there for WWDC, Leo.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   I'm coming back.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   Oh, yay!
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Yeah, that's just a couple of weeks off.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Well, probably by the way, we will do live coverage of the
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   WWDC keynote.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Awesome.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   And maybe you will join us afterwards.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   And finally, Chris Breen, the MacDaddy, Mac911 from Macworld.com.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   Body of Breen on Twitter.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Hello, Chris.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   And his album of the week today features--
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   You want to take a guess about what that might be.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   Oh, I don't recognize it at all.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   No.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   It's a little obscure.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   It is an evening with Wildman Fisher.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   That was from Sappa Project from 1968.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   Basically, Frank found this guy who's a lunatic and gave him
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   made a double album with him.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   That's it.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Yeah, I always liked Captain Beefheart was obscure, but
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   Wildman Fisher, now you're really going all the way.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Well, Wildman Fisher is something.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   That is indeed a picture of him holding a knife to a picture of
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   his mother.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   Yeah, so I think that says enough.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   Zappa was the original media prankster, I think.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Great stuff.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   Always is.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   I'm a long time Zappa fan.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   So welcome.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Good to have you all.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   I guess the big story.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   In fact, it was going on this morning.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, was testifying in front of a Senate
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   committee about Apple's tax policies.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   Here's Karl Levin, the chairman of the committee, welcoming Tim Cook.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   This is five hours long.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   Yeah, we won't air the whole thing.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   I will.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   I have never had any ease.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   Well, one of the things he said is I have an iPhone in my pocket,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   but you just wanted to say Apple is an American success story.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   I have an iPhone in my pocket, but Apple also has, quote, a
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   highly developed tax avoidance program and they have sought the
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   Holy Grail of tax avoidance by sending up offshore corporate
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   networks.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   I've been talking about it before.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   What was it?
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   The Irish run around in the French sandwich or I can't
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   remember what it was called, but we've, I mean, this has been
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   well known for a long time.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   Apple avoided virtually all tax on 36 billion dollars in
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   worldwide sales, no US tax in 2012 on those US sales.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   They avoided nine billion tax dollars.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   Federal tax.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   Federal tax.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   They're paying state tax.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   Isn't that funny?
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   Isn't that funny?
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   No, I'm not saying you're paying when you every time you buy
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   something from an Apple store, you're paying state tax.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   Yeah, I mean, but this doesn't pay Apple doesn't pay state tax.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   I couldn't organize.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   All right.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   Apple avoided nine billion dollars in US taxes avoiding
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   twenty five million dollars a day or a million dollars an hour,
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   according to Carl Levin in taxes.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   But Congress has been very anxious to point out that, and you
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   pointed this out, Chad, a lot of members of Congress have been
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   tweeting, we love Apple.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   Nothing wrong with you, Apple.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   And nobody is, I don't think anybody is a, a, a, a
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   Vering that this is in a legal tax avoidance strategy.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   It's not even close.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   I mean, the thing is, is that it's not even close to being
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   illegal because it's, it's not doing any of the, a lot of the
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   stuff that people are talking about, the, the angles, because
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   the thing is, it's illegal, but it's kind of unethical.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   Oh, I don't think so.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   Well, here's the thing is that, is that what they're not doing
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   is what a lot of companies do, which is to license software to
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   an offshore account and send it back to them, you know, but, you
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   know, and so the thing is, is they're not, they are doing
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   things they've been doing what they're doing since the 80s.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   They are doing, you know, they are building these things out.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   Obviously they're taking advantage of it.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   I mean, a lot of them, I guess John McCain saying, Apple's
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   corporate tax strategy reflects a flawed tax system.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Yes.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   He says, Apple's three primary Irish entities hold 60% of
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   the company's profits, but claim to be tax residents
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   nowhere in the world, not even in Ireland.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   That's because it doesn't fulfill Ireland's, Ireland's
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   requirements for a corporation.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   So they're avoiding taxes entirely on this.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   A lot of this is what I would call the Kitty Cat Rule.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   What's that?
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   The Kitty Cat Rule is that your cat doesn't eat you because
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   you're a lot bigger than it is.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   You know, they seem nice and they seem sweet.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   They'd like to.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   Those cats, they sit on your, they sit on your, they sit on
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   your lap and they per and everything else.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   The moment you're one tenth of your size that you currently
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   are, they would eat you.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   And the issue is, is that, is that we all complain about
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   Apple doing whatever it can to reduce his taxes while we go
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   to H&R Block and use TurboTax to make sure that we don't pay
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   any more taxes than we have to as an individual.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   That's, that's, that's different.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   I mean, we're, we're looking at the, first of all, I agree
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   that this is a tempos and a teapot.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   I don't think that it's, and so you also have to point out
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   that Apple's official statement on this is that we would like
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   to see a revision, we would have, we would pay more taxes
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   and pay more taxes locally here to the United States of America
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   if you revise your tax code.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   So there wasn't such an incredible advantage for us to do
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   this way.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   But I think it's, it's the way that I usually look at this is
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   that it's sort of like those extreme couponing shows where I
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   don't think anybody begratches the fact that, oh, look,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   the store did not understand that, but they did it two for one
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   on this stake.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   It will be possible for you to apply this with your, your,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   your discount card with this double A, triple A discount to get
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   10 stakes for free.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   You sort of admire that.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   But then when you see someone who is able to wheel out eight
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   carts worth of like $800 worth of food for free and cleaning out
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   like all of the stakes for the entire store so that no one else
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   could get them at the 25% discount.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   That's when you start thinking that perhaps there is,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   perhaps they should close those loopholes so that it is not
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   possible someone to operate that way.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   So yes, it's, it doesn't look good, but I don't think we
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   should say that the, I don't think anybody would really should
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   really say that Apple's really trying to pull a fast one anywhere.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   But it's, I don't think it's had a reasonable...
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   But let's, let's, let's just see if, let's just see if they stick
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   by that stake.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   We would love you to change your tax laws.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   And if you went as soon as you do, we would love to pay more taxes.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   It's sort of like saying, well, I would absolutely love to pay
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   $5 an hour to park here.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   No, they wouldn't give for free.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   They would love to bring their money back to the United States.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   That is clear.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   I mean, they're, they're taking out a loan.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   They're spending a lot of money and they're taking out a loan because
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   they don't want to bring it back.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   They're taking a loan to avoid taxes.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   If it was a lot of corporations that if it was 15% corporate taxes or
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   whatever would bring all their money back really quickly.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   You know, and they would definitely do it while it was available.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   I got to point out though that unlike the coupon scam, when a company doesn't pay
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   its fair share of taxes, those of us who do pay our fair share of taxes pay more.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   But we, I guess that what I would say is that all of us, I don't know about all of us,
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   but I know for me, you know, I am not going to pay the government a penny more than I have.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   No, I have to pay as little as I can.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   And as my company grows, no, as my company grows.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   I become much more sensitive and much better.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   And you know, I have more people that I pay that make sure that I don't have to pay more taxes than I have to.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   And if I could figure out how to build my company in Ireland, I would do it too.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   I mean, you know, the thing is that I don't have to do share your responsibility to its stakeholders
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   to make as much money as possible.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   That's their job.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   I mean, it's just like the tax laws in the United States are so idiotic that I don't feel bad for them at all.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Rand Paul says, "I'm offended that Congress is bullying one of America's great success stories.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   He's offended by the tone and tenor of the subcommittee hearing to bully one of America's great success stories.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   Is not doing anything illegal.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   If anyone should be on trial here," says Rand Paul, "it's Congress for creating a bizarre and Byzantine tax code
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   that simply doesn't compete with the rest of the world.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   We should be shining a mirror on ourselves."
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   Actually, you can't disagree with that either.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   I completely agree with that.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   Apple's doing something completely legal.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   Carl Levin said, "The committee's not going to apologize to Apple.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   We didn't drag them here.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   They've come willingly."
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   I think that that's actually in a way that is an important point to make.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   Tim Cook went to Congress and said, "Let me explain this to you."
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   I would have loved to see Steve Jobs do this though.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   I can't imagine Steve doing that.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   Awesome TV though.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   I don't think he'd do that.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   I'll give you a tax.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   If he'd actually done it, it would have been fiery.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   It would have been awesome.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   The testimony, as you said, was five hours, but it just ended about half an hour ago.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   You more than welcome to watch the whole thing.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   I think a lot of times when you see something in an exercise like this, it's in lieu of
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   actually doing something about it.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   It's like you see-
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   Well, it is regrettable.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   There's no legislative body that can do anything.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   [laughter]
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   Blue holes in the tax code.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   It's important that Tim come up there and say, "Gee, if there was only someone around
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   here who could do something about this, it might happen."
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   But clearly, there isn't.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   Too bad.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   I mean, it's so- I don't know.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   Every day now, you know, as a corporation, every day you just go, "I cannot believe they're
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   doing this to me again and again and again."
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   What?
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   Taking in the state-
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   No, no, no, the way they do it.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   I mean, it's so complex and there's so many little rules and there's so-
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   It is.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   That I will admit that as my company has grown, I've grown to have a very, very adversarial
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   relationship with the IRS.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   And not in a way that I'm not in any trouble or anything else, but I got to say, "I don't
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   feel like I owe them anything."
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   And as far as I'm concerned, I'm not going to break any laws.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   We have spent a lot of time staying within code.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   But what we're moving-
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   The thing that's a little offensive to me is that here in the- there's a benefit to being
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   in the United States, that Apple benefited from being in the U.S. I think.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   And so there is a responsibility that comes along with it.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   If you didn't want to pay taxes, you could move to Trinidad and Tobago.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   You know?
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   I mean, you don't have to-
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   They are injecting probably- if you include the employees, you know, the amount of taxes
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   that their employees in-
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   Right.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   You know, they're probably injecting $10 billion of taxes a year into the U.S.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   I just hear a lot of business owners saying, "Hey, I'm- you know, they're killing me with
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   the taxes."
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   But, you know, go drive down the street that's built with taxes.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   Go on the interstate that's built with taxes.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   I mean, there- there's- there- we are constantly benefiting from the taxes paid.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   And you should definitely pay-
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   And if somebody doesn't pay their fair share-
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   But what is fair share, I guess, is the-
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   Well, and I agree, Congress screwed it up.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   It's- you know, and the thing is is that the- the- the- the- the- the- the onus right now
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   is on Congress to fix it.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   And until they do that-
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   Right.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   What they can expect is everyone will use every legal means to not pay more taxes than they
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   have to.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   And that includes the individuals who go to H&R Block.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   That includes the corporations who will move things to Ireland.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   That includes me moving my gear.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   You know, we're moving my gear from out of California because I get taxed on it every year.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   You know, like, you know, and- and- and- and- and-
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Well, it happens.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   You know, you know, and that's-
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   Just so people understand-
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   Just so people understand-
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   What happens is that Congress adds loopholes at the behest of different groups.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   It's to benefit different groups.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   And a good example that everybody's probably aware of is the mortgage tax credit.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   -You get credit for the interest you pay on your home mortgage, which Congress used as a way to
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   incent people to buy houses, whether that was good public policy or not, I don't know.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   But that was the point.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   And so, okay, we'll give you a tax break for your mortgage interest.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   We'll multiply that times a thousand tax breaks for a huge variety of arcane things.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   And then suddenly you get a tax code that even an individual paying taxes can barely understand.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   -Yeah.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   -But unfortunately what happens is individuals fire their 1040EZ and they pay the full percent.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   And a big corporation or even a small one, like yours or mine, can afford to hire specialists.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   And I know how to play the game.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   So-
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   -But I mean, it needs to be fixed.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   I mean, I think that they need to close the loopholes and they lower the overall taxes and close the loopholes
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   so that you're actually-
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   -That's not going to happen because again, Congress wants to use taxes as a way of promoting certain behaviors.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   -So I guess what I'd say is that it offends me that they blame anyone but themselves for what they're in.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   That's what- I think that's the problem.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   You know, they've created this problem.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   It's on their head and if they want to fix it, they should.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   -But otherwise-
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   -So Congress-
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   -You mean Congress?
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   -Yeah.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   -So is this a black eye?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   Let's get back to the issue of hand, which is Apple.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   Is this a black eye to Apple?
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   -I don't think so.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   -Well, it can be.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   I mean, this is exactly the sort of situation where the historic Apple position of we don't have to talk.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   We don't have to- we're going to maintain our bubble and we're going to control the news story is not going to work.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   So that's why it's not surprising that Tim Cook is willing to go out there and put that message out there.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   You can imagine five years ago, maybe even six years ago, a time when there would just- there would be a kind of a terse statement made out that,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   "Okay, well, we're not doing anything illegal.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   We're not doing anything wrong.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   We continue to excel and hire people and we're making the best personal computers known to mankind.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   Goodbye."
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   But yeah, they really do have to at least stay ahead of this.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   -Well, I think that one of the things they did really well was they underlined, you know, we do not have accounts in the Cayman Islands.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   We do not have things that are pure shelters.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   We build for worse.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   -It could be worse.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   -No, but the thing is, a lot of companies that are doing things are a lot more complicated.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   And what I think what Apple doesn't want to do is be wrapped up into a scandal about people who are just moving money around,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   you know, for no reason.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   I mean, Apple has definitely structured their company to build around it, but they're not doing a lot of paper corporations, you know, to avoid taxes.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   -Well, also, this is a pretty safe target for the Senate.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   -Yeah.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   I mean, you didn't see them pull X on it up there, right?
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   Who, I would imagine their books are not as clean as Apple, or perhaps they do the same kind of throwing money around.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   But then you've got, you know, representatives from Oklahoma and Texas and people are involved in the oil industry who say,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   "Well, no, no, no, we can't do that because that's in our backyard."
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   But rather, what are they going to do?
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   They're going to go after Apple and what, irritate Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and a few California representatives.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   -And it's easy, you know, because John McCain can ask his tech support question and you can all kind of giggle about that.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   But if you really want to go after this stuff, talk to the companies like GE and Exxon and who are doing this stuff for years and years and years.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   -Google does the same thing, almost exactly with the Irish IP and the whole thing.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   And Starbucks and Amazon.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   -I'm sure nobody does.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   -Even small tech companies do it.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   I mean, it's...
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   -I would do it.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   I don't know how.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   [laughter]
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   -Well, I mean, we're even...
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   I mean, we do more than I'm going to Sydney and we're getting ready.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   -Well, you do a lot of international business.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   -And we're getting ready.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   We're not there yet, but we're about to stop bringing the money back in.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   -Right.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   -You know, like, you know, like we're going to start structuring because I'm doing enough workouts outside the country.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   It's not that we're structuring anything to hide money.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   It's just like, "Well, if we're going to make it out there, why would I bring it back in and pay 35% when I can leave it somewhere else?"
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   -Right.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   -Cook did take an opportunity to ask about, to talk a little bit of intellectual property to the committee.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   I don't know if these are the right people to talk to, but he says, "We need much more work on intellectual property in this country."
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   He was speaking about bootleg Apple stores in China, but more specifically about the slowness of the US court system.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   He says, "As a tech company, the US court system is currently structured in such a way.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   It's currently difficult to get the protections a technology company needs because the cycle's too long.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   By the time we get, you know...
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   -Well, by the time they try to...
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   -A resolution with Samsung, it doesn't matter anymore.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   -He's what he's saying is, "We can't block Samsung because it's obsolete by the time it's blocked."
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   -Right.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   -For us, intellectual property is so important to our company.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   I'd love to see this system strengthen to protect it.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   I love it. Tim Cook gets called in the car about taxes.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   He says, "But another thing, while I'm up here, while I have your ear, let me tell you what I'm up for tonight."
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   -Good for him.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   -I like that.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   -All right. Yeah, I don't think we need to say more about the taxes, but that is the big Apple story of the day.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   So I think we should mention that. However, there are some other very...
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   But, Ken Tim's response by the text question, "Apple pays all the taxes we owe."
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   And that really is the right answer.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   You know, if you don't like it, change the law.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   Apple has real operations in real places with Apple employees selling real products to real customers.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   We pay all the taxes we owe every single dollar.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   We not only comply with the laws, we comply with the spirit of the laws.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   The tax code has not kept up with a digital age.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   And in fact, and we'll talk about this when we come back from the break,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   there's going to be a Mac made in the US, and it's not anything that exists today.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   -Duh-duh-duh-dum. -Mm-hmm.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   -Where's our squirrel? -He did say they'll be assembled in Texas.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   -Interesting. -Duh-duh-duh-dum-dum.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   Our show today brought to you by very appropriately enough, LegalZoom.com.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   If you are not a corporation, there are some real benefits to you.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   And you can do it. Maybe you've been saying, "I can't do this. It's too expensive, too complicated."
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   You can do it yourself at LegalZoom.com. LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   It's a self-help site that'll walk you through the process of doing what you need to do to set up, say, an LLC,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   or a corporation to a trademark or copyright your intellectual property to do a patent, an NDA, and more.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   And for your family, they do wills.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   So an LLC, a corporation, $99 at the starting price, a will, $69.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   You can establish a living trust there. And really, it is really important.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   I think this discussion highlights this, that you work in a way that you're cognizant of what the law demands,
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   and you do exactly what is right and not anymore. And that's exactly what this is about.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   It's not going to be tax help, by the way. We're talking an LLC. There you go. That's what I used.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   S-Corp, C-Corp. Trademarks, Chad did that. I love that.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   It's better than just trying to go out and search the internet to try to figure out how to do this.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   No, I don't think so. That would be wrong. It's a lot more affordable than getting a lawyer.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   Although LegalZoom's legal plan will get you help from an attorney. I like this, too.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   At fixed prices, preset prices, you choose the attorney and the state you are operating in,
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   and they have profiles and unedited customer reviews, so you can get a good idea of what that attorney will offer you.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   And you get to ask questions. There's lots of questions that you might come up as you fill out these forms,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   and this is a great way to do that. LegalZoom is a great way. I highly recommend it to get this work done at an affordable price.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   And if you're a startup, this is something you ought to know about. If you just had kids, this is something you really ought to know about.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   LegalZoom.com. Use our offer code MBW at checkout. We'll give you 10 bucks off, just as a way of saying.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   Thank you for mentioning us. LegalZoom.com. Offer code MBW.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   All right, let me go back to this story because I got excited and I want to read it to you exactly as written.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   But apparently, Tim Cook did mention this new Mac at the Senate hearing, but now...
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   Okay, where is this? Oh, there it is. A new model in an existing family.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   What does that mean? Is it a new iMac?
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   Mac Mini Pro. Mac Mini Pro. It'll be made in Texas, but he gave it an interview at Politico.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   He said it'll be an iteration of an existing family. It won't be just a collection of parts shipped from overseas, assembled in the US.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   That'll be parts from Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, and Texas.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   Mac Mini. That would be the easiest one.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   I think this is a marketing thing. I mean, 90% of Apple products will continue to be made in China.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   I don't know about that. I see it more as a trial balloon to see how well they could do this.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   Because if you think about all the... What's the advantage of Apple doing a US-made Mac strictly as a PR sort of thing?
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   None of Apple's customers care as yet that their stuff is all made in China, so it's not really an advantage.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   However, if they can figure out a way to reduce costs of shipping components from here, there, and everywhere,
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   if there's a specific type of device they're making right now where there are stuff where a lot of the components have to be manufactured,
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   or a key component that are expensive to ship, are manufactured here in the United States, it behooves them to see,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   well, let's try that and see how well it works.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   It also makes sense. I think it's a trial balloon.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   Yeah, it makes sense then that would be a completely new product.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   Because maybe they'll charge a little more for it too as a result of it being made in the US.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   Because you can't compare it.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   They can test that and then there's no comparison.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   So what would it be? We know it's a Mac Pro.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   Mac Pro. Mac Mini Pro.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   A new Mac Pro.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   A new Mac Pro.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   A modular Mac Pro. Do you think they'll do that?
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   I think that would be the easiest one.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   I think it displays.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   I think it's all these Midwestern Lutheran grandmas get them knitting.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   That's it.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   They're retirees.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   They have nothing buried.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   Well, they've buried into things to do, but you know, not quite so profitable.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   It's our full employment program for Midwestern grandmas.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   Exactly.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   I'm going with an education model.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   Ah.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   See, I would not think that the education model because I would think that those are more cost sensitive.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   I think a Mac Pro or Mac Mini Pro or Mac Pro Mini or whatever is something that is going after a market that's less
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   cost sensitive that you could charge more for than with things that are going to be tighter.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   It's tough.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   You know, my high school has a one-to-one program.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   The high school I get my kids go to and I serve on their board.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   We're entering freshman and used to get a Mac book.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   And Apple stopped educational discounts to any appreciable point.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   It's going to cost them $1,200 and they can't afford it.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   So they're giving them Lenovo's.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   How'd that pronounce?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   I don't know yet.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   It'll be freshman.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   It's just a good time.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   It's just a good time.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   You know, I'm sitting on the board meeting.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   I'm going, "Ah, hello, man."
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   Think of the children, Apple.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   Think of the children.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   But you know, I understand why.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   You know, these are, hey, they're ruggedized.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   There's something Apple can offer with.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   They're ruggedized.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   I was pushing for Chromebooks, to be honest.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   If there's a budget issue, get them Chromebooks.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   Right.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   But they want full operating systems and they do video and audio editing.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   These are set up.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   The Macs were set up so they could record classes and listen to them later.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   I mean, they had all this stuff that made a lot of sense.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   I think it makes me sad.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   Well, I come with education because I think it's a fairly predictable market.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   They have a season in which they sell these things.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   So along with Andy's trial balloon set up, it does give you more control
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   or your inventory when you need to make it what the size of that market might be.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   And it does allow you to make kind of that oddball Mac that you're not going to try to
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   distribute to everybody on Earth.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   It doesn't affect the chain.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   Right.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   It really is kind of its own little device.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   And that's where you start your Easy Bake Oven plant to make just these things.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   See how it goes.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   And then from there, you can expand.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   Right.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.960]   You'd also have to think that given that the one of the greatest advantages to manufacturing
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.600]   overseas is the cost of labor is that you'd sort of be thinking, well, you'd want to think
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.800]   about devices that can be mostly automated assembly.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.160]   So as opposed to fiddly like handheld consumer devices that you really do need to have human
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.800]   beings, you know, slapping these things together.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   So I think it would be a lower volume thing rather than a higher volume thing.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:10.680]   More good news, of course, Apple's inventory of MacBook Airs is gone to zero in many cases.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.400]   That's usually a sign that a new device is coming out.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.000]   Tie that with the announcement of the Haswell processors at the beginning of June, WWDC,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.120]   a week or two later.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.960]   I think we're going to see MacBook Airs now.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:30.320]   It's the 13 inch MacBook Airs that are no longer available at retailers like Amazon,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.440]   B&H, Mac connection and Mac mall.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   So what do we think?
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.440]   Retina with the touchscreen.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440]   How do you like to?
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.160]   I know about touchscreen, but I do think retina makes sense for WWDC.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.840]   I mean, that is the pros.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.760]   You almost gave me a heart attack.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.080]   I like a touchscreen.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.440]   I got to tell you, I'm enjoying it.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.480]   I have the Chromebook Pixel and I have this window.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.160]   I'm doing it to my current laptop.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   I keep on going like this.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   We're so used to touch on iOS and I admit for desktop that may be less.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.760]   I'm sorry, I test on the Pixel and I find myself now just going, I don't.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.360]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.960]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.800]   And I think OS 10 would blend itself perfectly well to that.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.000]   I think especially ones as well because they're merging them.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.680]   I think you're going to need a new version of OS 10 to do it.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   Absolutely.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   When would you release that?
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Oh, wait.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.800]   I mean, you might announce it, but to also announce a touch based computer that you can't
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.120]   touch yet.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.520]   No.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.440]   So September for that when they roll out that possibly, but I think for WWDC, you're really
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.880]   looking at the pro model.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   That's all.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.560]   That's a display, a new refresh of the MacBook Pro.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.160]   It would be lovely if they had a new Mac Pro of some kind, please.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.840]   Can they do a retina air?
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.280]   13 inch air or not?
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   I doubt it.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.920]   They need better battery technology or they need substantially better power management
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.640]   and better LEDs lighting.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.680]   Everything needs to be more efficient in order to get the battery life because right now
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.880]   the formula is still the same.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.560]   You get retina, you get lightness or you get good battery life and you can pick two of
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.280]   the three and until that formula changes, you won't be able to get products because Apple's
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.480]   not going to sell a retina MacBook Air that gets an hour or two hours of battery life.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   Curse is foiled again.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.840]   Also they need the price points where they are right now.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.520]   So they would really have to be in the position where they can say 13 inch MacBook Air, same
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:24.000]   price announced retina because they're already having some problem.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.440]   I'm sorry, I already was speaking.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.960]   It's okay for them to have the MacBook Pros with Retina displays where they're really
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.080]   a super premium pricing, as long as they still have at least a moderate to premium pricing
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.320]   model underneath it.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:43.120]   So if they were to raise the price of the $999 MacBook Air to make it a retina, retina
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.520]   display, that would be a big, big problem, I think.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.320]   I'd be happy with Haswell in a 13 inch.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.120]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.200]   The most common thing in a track book is going to be the Retina Air Leo.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.600]   It's not much heavier, not much thicker.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.240]   The Retina 15 inch is pretty thin.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.160]   Yeah, the 13 inch is pretty light.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.280]   So that'll be your Retina MacBook Air.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   Okay.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.880]   What would the resolution be on a Retina 13?
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   What is it?
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.960]   I forget what it is now.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.520]   It's not 2500.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   That's the 15 inch.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.080]   But it's pretty good, especially if you put it in the scaled resolutions, it can get pretty
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.920]   high because in the Retina resolution, there's not enough pixels for me.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.760]   But when I scale it, it becomes much better.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   I want it.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   I want it.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   I've been holding off.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.440]   That's why I'm still using this thing.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   I broke down.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   I got one.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.440]   I got what?
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   I got near.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   Oh, no, you're crazy, man.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   It's like the little shuttle.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   It's got to be new.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   I still have that any minute there, man.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.440]   I got that.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   I got a month ago.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   You was coming, though.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   I got it a month ago.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   I was like, I can't wait anymore.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.440]   I know.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.440]   I'm suffering with this.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   No, it's still.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.240]   It's just it's literally just when I'm when I'm in United economy, I just need something
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.440]   I can actually open and work on.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   Well, that's a problem.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   That's why I have 11 inches.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.040]   It's like that smallest thing that I can open so that I can.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.000]   Why are you flying economy?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   You're you're you're.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Think of all the tax savings.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.320]   I pay the 10 bucks for the extra leg room and then I use my computer on my lap and the
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.600]   15 inch hits fine that way.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   No, it works fine.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.560]   Yeah, economy plus on United is the worst thing is to have the notebook on this on the
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.880]   tray and the guy in front of you leans back.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.440]   I've seen someone fold one.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.040]   I'm just I'm just waiting for that to happen.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.440]   So I always when I want this is this is my little my little travel tip is that when you
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.400]   someone's in front of you until they put it back, you always turn your screens so that
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.240]   it will so the angle of your screen goes past where they when you have the tray open, it
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.040]   goes past that so they open it will slide behind it because I've actually seen someone
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.360]   hit that and it it's really cool when it when someone really goes back quickly, it takes
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.960]   your screen and folds it about 30 degrees and then it just yeah changes colors.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.160]   But I travel with the 15 inch all the time and I've never had a problem using it just
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.400]   because I put it on my lap and it's not as comfortable as a tray, but it works fine.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.320]   But you get the economy plus or whatever.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.280]   Yeah, yeah, economy plus is really all you need.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   That's interesting question though.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:56.400]   Renee, why do you travel with the 15 because I I switched to the iPad for most of my travel,
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.520]   most of my travel, but if I really did need a MacBook for all my traveling, I would really
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:06.400]   that's I would so totally buy something smaller because the first time I took a trip with
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.720]   with something smaller than a 15 inch laptop, that was the last time I ever was going to
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.400]   travel with a 15 inch.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.760]   So there's two reasons for that.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.040]   One is I gave my heir to my sister the same reason you know Leo gave his heir away and
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.400]   I'm not going to buy another one until WWDC and the other reason is most of my travels
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.200]   these days have been to do a lot of video and Final Cut Pro works so much better on
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.040]   a retinomac than it does on an air.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.920]   It ends up saving me time even though it's a lot of effort.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   Okay.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.760]   I I give you permission then to carry 15.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.920]   See, see, I we do production on my knife.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   We do streams.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.120]   Everybody else take one of these instead it works just fine.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.000]   You should see Andy you should see me get out of the like the TSA.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.560]   You know, when I get to the thing because I have two two retinas and a and an air and
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.240]   then two different iPads and slow it's like the slow process.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:04.760]   It's five bins every single time and geez, for me for me the fun part is like again,
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.520]   I try to travel very, very light.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.640]   The only thing that I think about that occasionally problem is when I'm when I'm doing a book
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.120]   because I'm a one man operation.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.600]   I don't have like an arm David Lean style movie production kit of a unit behind him.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.040]   The only the only times that I'm really, really heavily laid down are when I'm testing phones.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.160]   I might travel with four phones for various reasons, but the fun part is my I travel with
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.320]   one carry on is a hard-sided carry on and I can almost always tell when they get to my
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.120]   bag because that's when like the conveyor comes to complete halt because they just see
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:42.240]   this like a satellite of a nuclear plant in North Korea and they're trying to figure
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.160]   out what part of this is cables what part of these are different batteries.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.560]   We get possibly we have nine different battery packs for eight different note.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.640]   Let's let's just pop this thing.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.720]   So help you if there's a microphone in there because that's indecipherable.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   It is.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.880]   It turns out countryman mics are really popular.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   Really?
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   You say you all you take what is that?
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   You got to take them out of your bag.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   It looks like a fuse or something.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.520]   Yeah, you know, they never want to tell you what they're why they're looking at.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.800]   These are the little we use these little tiny microphones and Madonna.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.720]   Little ones that go on your face because you end up calling them.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.720]   It's funny.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   I think they look like fuses and they never want.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.760]   They never want to tell you why they pulled you out like what part of your bag.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.480]   But fortunately, since I go through the metal detector four times a month a week on average,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.760]   I through a process of deduction.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.480]   I have figured out, you know, which components in my bag.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.640]   So I start pulling them out and go, you don't need to take that out.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.600]   And I'm like, yes, yes, I do.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   Exactly.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.360]   But second rolling thing, then you have to wait for a guy to come over and start going
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.520]   through everything.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:45.000]   I just want to show you the image of what Alex carries with him when he's checking into
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   the airport.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.680]   This is from your Google plus.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.480]   That's actually a small kid.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.560]   That's that's the small kid.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   It is.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   That's his own.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.560]   He brings his own.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.400]   He's like, he's like share like a look for every single event.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.160]   I had another one in there somewhere that I that was his own truck.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.720]   That one that one was not my own trolley.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.880]   But I do check my own trolley sometimes after you halo drunk Alex, how long does it take
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.960]   you to find all the gear and re-emass it?
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.920]   After you hail a cab.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.320]   Halo jump out of the airplane.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   Exactly.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.800]   Well, the key is you keep them all tied to you.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.600]   No one promise when you hit the trees.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   Wow.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   Then you get stuck.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.320]   No, yes, I've got to I promise you this is what I'm about to say is going to latch into
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.600]   your brain and you're going to get the engineers online.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.640]   This is going to revolutionize your entire business travel.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.320]   But if you were to set us to invent a type of luggage where after you empty out each
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:45.800]   case, you can snap the cases together to form either an editing suite or a hotel room.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.200]   You got enough material to make a hotel room, I think.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.720]   You know, what's funny is that they are there are ones that we actually lock.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.280]   Some of these will stack up and make them part of the tables because we're running out
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.920]   of space and there are ones the ones that we the road the road ones that we actually
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.160]   drive to locations you can actually take the tops oftentimes and put them next to them.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.480]   They form tables and stuff.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   Wow.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   So it can be.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.560]   But this stuff is Pelican cases become kind of you've seen the Pelican case.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.800]   I've seen it in the hall.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   I would go through the hall or downstairs in the basement.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.480]   My my roll away is a Pelican case.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.320]   They make a version of that that fits in overheads and is like handed out for.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.360]   But it's specifically kitted out for like a cloth zippered liner inside.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.760]   And that's just like absolutely the best case I've ever ever.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.080]   It's totally revolutionized the way I travel after you picked it on Mac break weekly.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.200]   I bought one for my camera and that's what I roll.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.320]   You know, it's funny is with the 1510 you wonder why they made it that size.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.000]   And if you get on one of those perfect, if you get on one of those little puddle jumpers,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.920]   you know, little turbo props, the 1510 is the largest bag that you can have that'll
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   fit in the overhead.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.520]   And it fits like it fits as if it was made for it.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.560]   You know, the spending money now.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.040]   And the most important part is because it's hard sided.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.120]   If you get caught and all the overheads are full, you can hand that off and check it and
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.920]   you don't think it's going to get crushed.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.560]   And the second part is if you're like me and you like are packing like all the free
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.920]   minutes to check out and so you're desperately stuffing things into bags, you cannot overstuff
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.920]   this.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.800]   Therefore make it too large to fit inside the overheads.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.200]   And get get the dividers.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Don't get the foam.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   Yeah, I got the dividers on your suggestion.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.840]   Yeah, the dividers are the way to go.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.640]   And then you don't get the foam and there it is.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.920]   And then the key is then you take if you're checking these, then you take you take you
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   take zip ties.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.000]   So that so that you know, makes it a little inconvenient to break into them because we're
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   got a lot of gear on them.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Because anybody could, but they'd have to have pliers.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.160]   And then and then they so just it's just not that you can just open it.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   You know, you have to think about it.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   And you know, that's all you're really trying to do is make it inconvenient because you're
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.640]   not allowed to lock them anyway.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.240]   And but the TSA could snip those.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.000]   Yeah, they do because they don't look into them.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.480]   You know, you know, so why don't you just get a TSA lock because they wear out the zip
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.640]   ties are actually better.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.000]   And I mean, the zip ties aren't any more secure.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.440]   You recommend locks desert tan OD greener black.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   All of ours are black.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.520]   But Alex, important question.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.200]   How do you cut those zip ties open given that you weren't allowed to take a good question.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.840]   Here's the answer is in your own bag that you checked that has your clothes in it.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.520]   In the front pocket, you put a there's two things that are in the front pocket.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.240]   One is a Leatherman, as you can check it.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   And the other one is the straps that you use to strap all the all those bags to your cart
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.240]   when it when it shows up.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.320]   You know, so you can strap them all down anyway.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.800]   So so the straps and the Leatherman goes in the front and if you can't do that, the thing
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.560]   to remember is the way that the zip ties were if you just twist them, they will break.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.720]   So you get a fork and you stick them in there and twist it.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.640]   That's all you see in a metal fork plastic forks don't work so well, they break.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.440]   We're going to take a break this week in travel.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.680]   I never go anywhere.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   I know.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.960]   I mean, what's funny is we get our guys can talk about this for hours because it's all
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.800]   I mean, we deal with this so like, you know, Leon still holds the record.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   Leana LaHooa.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   23 bags.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   23 bags.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   They're not all hers though.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   Well, they were all about.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.000]   But I mean, one person checking 23 bags, that's the record.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.280]   And you pay 50 bucks per extra bag, right?
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.800]   Yeah, that's a lot of it.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   It's over an media rate.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.520]   If you're not in media rate, it's like 200.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.680]   Oh, there's a media rate.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.040]   Oh, I didn't about that.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.520]   I'm a media.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   So I could just say media.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   You say media rate.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.400]   You got to have you got to have a like a special media idea.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   Yeah, press pass.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.400]   Yes.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   All right.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.600]   Business card that says media media.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.000]   And I can't wear a fedora with a little thing that says press in the rim.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Would that work?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Yes.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Little camera with the flash bulb in it.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   And it's for free.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.360]   You get bus rides and taxi.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.480]   He's pulling something out here.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.440]   He's anyway, it's while you're looking, I'm going to just say Roberto is in the chatroom
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.120]   with the throwboy, Roberto Hoyos.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.200]   And he's got just four days left on his Kickstarter campaign.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.880]   They're so close to their goal of $20,000.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.040]   And they've added a limited edition backer reward.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.840]   Remember the ICO?
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.200]   It's back, baby.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:08.680]   So this is to get throwboy into the next level.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   And we love throwboy.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.640]   They've made some great twit pillows.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.480]   If you look at the rewards, there's a variety of them.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.440]   You could pledge a dollar or $5 or $10 or $20.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.760]   But if you want the ICO, you got to pledge $100.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.320]   There's only 16 left.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.240]   This is actually, that's for international backers.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:34.080]   This is a 25 left for the US limited condition.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.800]   Only 1,200 were made.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:44.200]   If you want the ICO, quick go to Kickstarter for the special throwboy chat pillow collection.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   It's right now.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   Tell your friends.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   Yeah, you only have four days.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   But for me, you're going to tell your friends.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   For both of you, I see your pillow will be shipped to Ireland through the Netherlands.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.120]   It's so special to you.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.760]   As always, as always.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.120]   Our show today brought to you by those great folks at audible.com.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.160]   I'm ready for a new book.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.360]   I just finished your book, pictures at a revolution.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   Loved it, Andy.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.360]   And then I watched all five movies.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.280]   It's about the Academy Award nominees in 1968.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.600]   It was lovely.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.200]   So thank you for a great recommendation.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   I'm really interested.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.640]   It wasn't a great story that made you so happy you don't work in the movie industry.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   Oh, God.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.960]   Just the things you go through.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.200]   What I actually came away with is huge admiration for the dedication of people like Warren
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   Beatty and others.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.960]   Because in order to make this artistic venture, the crap you have to put up with, just animals.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.000]   Even if you are Warren Beatty kind of at the top of your career, you have to be able
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.080]   to tell the studios, "You're right.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.680]   I suppose you shouldn't be making movies with me then."
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.320]   And then walk away.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   Yep.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   Pretty great story.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.360]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   But I'm looking for a new one.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.400]   Now I've got a few on my list here.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.600]   I just got Silver Linings Playbook, the novel.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.800]   See, I like reading the novels of great movies.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.360]   This is up the movie.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.760]   Well, I've seen the movie.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.240]   So now the movies messed up the novel.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   I just finished the Patrick Rothfuss series.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.160]   That's great wise men's fear is the most recent one.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   I've got the Hunger Games.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.040]   Saw the movie, but I thought I'd read the book.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.040]   Great North Road, Peter F. Hamlin.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.960]   I'm just deciding which I should.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.440]   Maybe you have a recommendation, Andy.

[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.880]   Yeah, just came out today.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.240]   Now available from the author of The Kite Runner.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.080]   But what are you-- oh, what's that control all delete?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.240]   What was that one, Chad?
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   Reboot and rebuild your business.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   Ah.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   Guess not.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.480]   I'm also known as burning down the factory for this money.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.080]   What are you listening to?
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.160]   Next up on my cue is a really neat book on the Apollo landings.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.920]   I've been looking-- usually, more often than not, when I look for an Audible version of
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.560]   one of my favorite books, I will find it there.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.960]   And really for some reason wanted to have a storytelling version of Apollo.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.880]   Could not find my favorite book, The Man in the Moon.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.680]   But a moonshot, The Inside Story of Man's Greatest Adventure by Dan Perry.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:36.120]   It is really a linear storytelling story about, again, how we got people on the surface of
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:42.400]   the moon during Apollo 11 starting with the inability to even launch a man into sub-orbit.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.560]   So it's-- when you look at this story, it's such a compelling drama because you realize
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:54.080]   that it's not really about scientists figuring out-- solving a really complex technical problem.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:43:00.760]   It really was a breakthrough in project management about breaking up a really complex task into
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.920]   six critical different areas and then finding exactly the right obsessive, compulsive, tenacious
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.400]   engineers to attack and solve that problem.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.840]   And the way that all these pieces fit together and actually made history is-- I've read this
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.160]   story in so many forms with so many different pieces of source materials and that never,
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.960]   ever gets tired to me.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:27.120]   So if this isn't my favorite favorite favorite favorite book on the subject, it still hits
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.480]   all the points that I like.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.520]   It comes very well recommended by people I trust.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.480]   And you got a good 11 hours for the storytelling there.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   The other good thing about this is that there are a couple of books that are really good
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.600]   about the space program but terrible as audiobooks.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:49.000]   The project manager on the Lunar Lander wrote a really wonderful critical book about this.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.560]   You really want to get this book to find out all the problems that had been solved to build
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.920]   something that complicated.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.800]   But he talks like an engineer.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.280]   Basically the only thing that he saves you from is that he didn't actually tell you the
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:06.480]   thread pitch of the screws used to connect one of the control yolks to the linkage.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.240]   But that's pretty much the only technical detail he left out.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.040]   This book is more of a-- it's not designed for engineers.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.280]   It's not designed for historians.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.400]   It's designed for people who have seen that YouTube clip 80 million times and think,
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.440]   "Oh, gee, I wonder how that happened?"
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.520]   And there's a good way to find that out.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.800]   I love being of a certain age that I can actually remember that moon landing.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.280]   I'm watching those Walter Cronkite broadcasts.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.920]   Now we'll follow a lesson going to limbo.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.480]   I love them.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:38.000]   There's so few times when for my generation it seems like kids, you're not going to remember
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   this.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.440]   But when I was a kid, people of the same sex could not marry.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.640]   I know it seems stupid.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.960]   I know it's a fact of life now, but let me tell you what it was like.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.400]   That day when we-- you got that news report, then this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, two
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.600]   men or two women could marry each other.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:01.400]   I really wish that-- I'm envious that when I was a kid, man had-- human beings had never
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.800]   stepped foot on another celestial body.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.200]   And now for the rest of my life, I will live in a world in which human beings have walked
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.920]   on the surface of another celestial body.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.400]   Well, and one of the things that I got from that Hollywood book, Pictures at a Revolution,
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.200]   was how-- because Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was one of the nominated films, how controversial
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.520]   interracial marriage was, and illegal in fact, just before the movie came out.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.120]   You should read this book just to realize how controversial this was.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.760]   And they thought, well, we can make this movie.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.480]   It'll never play in the South because it's just too controversial.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.960]   And then you watch the movie and it's almost humorous.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.120]   And they had to make Sidney Poitier, who's the black fella gun I get married to, the
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.160]   white girl, they had to make him like Mother Teresa.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:51.520]   He was a doctor who went-- graduated from Stanford and worked at the World Health Organization.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.800]   Also critically, he's not American.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   He's a foreigner.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   Right.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   It's really interesting.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:02.320]   Anyway, that's why I love Audible because it brings new ideas to life.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.880]   I can't wait to the Robert Carro book.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.360]   I listened to the first three Johnson books.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.240]   I can't wait to the fourth Johnson book is available on Audible because those are great
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.240]   too.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   And I find that these long biographies and history books are kind of hard to read.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.680]   I fall asleep if I hold that book.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.680]   But when I'm in the car at the gym or doing the housework, I can get through long books.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.520]   That's my big-- looking at my house.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   It's like the moment-- well, I'm out of NPR.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.040]   I'm out of Twit to listen to.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.480]   And then I just start going through these books.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.800]   And right now I'm listening to a Rwanda ink, which is a part of my stuff.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.680]   It's great and I'm interested in that.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   Here's the problem.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.080]   You're only going to get one book and it's hard to choose.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   But think about this way.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.200]   Yeah, every month it's an exciting time when you get that new credit and get-- what am
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   I going to get this month?
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   It's a hot ink.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   All right.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   Wanda ink.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   That's another choice.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   Moonshot, Rwanda ink.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   There you go.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.680]   Audible.com/Macbreak, you're going to love it.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   Start today.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.400]   That's all I can say.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.480]   I listen on my Asonos speakers, so I have it throughout the house.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   I need to get some Asonos speakers.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   You could.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   The house resonates.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   They're expensive.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   I'm going to get it and then I hold your breath.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.280]   I can't go back to Alex.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   It's like the hue lights.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.080]   Your house has to be wireless.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.080]   Have you played with the hue yet, Renee?
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.080]   I have them.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.080]   I got them for Christmas.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.960]   Well, we talked last week, but I said up.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:27.720]   And if this then that, that when the sun comes up, my lights start pulsing in multiple
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.880]   colors, I turned that one off quick.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.160]   One of my writers is Georgia.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.680]   Both her and her husband have iPhones and now they're, you know, they don't want to set
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.160]   it up so you leave the house and they turn off.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   They're trying to duel for control of the device now.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.000]   You need more than one iPhone.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.160]   I just, yeah, that's the geofencing.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.160]   There's the stuff.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.760]   I just have a few does is so good.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   I bought more bulbs.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   I have nine now.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   I've been in my bedroom.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   I have this idea.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   I need about 20 of them.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   I have about 12 so far.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.000]   So hue, Asonos, pretty soon the whole house is just going to live, have a life of its own
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   long after your death.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Future Leo, the future.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.040]   The future is here.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:09.680]   You're watching Mac break weekly Renee Richie from imore.com Chris Breen from Macworld.com
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:17.200]   Alex Lindsey from the pixel court.com and Andy and Akka from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.360]   Old media.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.160]   I loved it.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.600]   Marissa Meyer along with the announcement that they're going to update Flickr.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.720]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.960]   I love that she said, and we're consolidating all 500 Yahoo!
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.640]   employees in New York City in the old New York Times building and saying, "Isn't that
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   great?
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   The new media moving?"
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   I don't feel like Yahoo!
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   Is to media anymore.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.320]   Yeah, they're not old media.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.440]   They're kind of like middle aged media.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.040]   So two big Yahoo! stories that are kind of relevant to the Macworld because I think a lot
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.760]   of Mac folks use Flickr.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.600]   A lot of photographers do.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.400]   Complete Flickr redesign and boy, a big change in the pricing that I'm not sure I really
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.680]   like.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.400]   And then they're really going to make Flickr ads supported regardless, right?
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.640]   You have to pay $500 a year if you don't want ads.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.040]   Nobody's going to do that.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.040]   Nobody's going to do that.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   Well, people are really committed to that.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.400]   Well, those of us who are grandfathered in on the pro accounts can keep going.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.760]   So we'll be every year we'll pay 50 bucks.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:18.120]   There's a lot more, twice as much actually.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:24.640]   We're grandfathered in, but new users either get ads in a terabyte or no ads in a terabyte.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   Or is it $50?
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.840]   Oh, $50 a year for pro.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.760]   Yeah, see, right.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.920]   But Waskill, you have to have an existing account.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.840]   You cannot sign up now for that.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:39.600]   500 bucks, but isn't 500 bucks for unlimited storage basically to duplicate what you get
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.520]   with a pro account?
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   No.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.120]   No, yes it is.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.760]   Because if you're free, this is the other thing.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.800]   We get a terabyte as pro users.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.920]   No, you get a few years.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.160]   The pricing structure is that it's like a good news, bad news sort of thing.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.960]   I'm making sure that I look such as, hopefully I don't misspeak.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:06.480]   The good news is that before the changeover, a free account was very limited, very useful,
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   but very limited.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.440]   You can only see most recent stuff like 100 pictures that have been posted.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.960]   They're all being stored, but only 100 the last 100 would be accessible.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.360]   Now a free account gives you one terabyte of storage, which is, and they have a little
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.880]   like, a cute little like web app sort of thing.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.440]   So you can see how big are your pictures?
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.080]   They are 8 gigabyte, 8 megapixel phone pictures.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   Great.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   You can store 350,000 of these pictures for free forever.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.900]   They have a new service called Doubler that costs 500 bucks a year with a cap of two
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.760]   terabytes.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:48.000]   And what they're trying to do is make sure that people don't take advantage of free
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.600]   storage for 8 cajillion photos forever.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   But who's going to pay 500?
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   I mean, you go to Smug mug or somewhere.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   That's crazy.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   It's complicated.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   Most people are.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.800]   So, okay, now I did get it wrong.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.360]   So if you are your grandfather, as the pro account, you still could do $25 a year pro
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.360]   account.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.280]   No ads, one terabyte.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.480]   If you pay $50 a year, you get the top of the line program.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.600]   That's no ads.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   And unlimited, I guess.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.920]   I don't know.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.480]   Because remember, 25 bucks a year was only the old cost.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.280]   If you bought two years in advance, I think the actual annual cost was $35.36.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   Right.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   Something like that.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280]   So it's not as though they increased.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.120]   They didn't increase the price a whole hell of a lot to give you that.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.640]   Well, and you're a big flicker user.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   What do you think?
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.880]   Do you like the new flicker, Andy?
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   I love it.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:47.120]   I still, flicker, I think has always had the, for me, has always had an edge over other
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.440]   things because sometimes you do want a service that tries to be everything.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.040]   And flicker, I think, was the best there was at everything.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.000]   There are other 500 PX was great.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.840]   If you wanted the best presentation, you could get Instagram was better for social,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:05.520]   all the other things for Amazon Web services better for if you wanted to do deep links.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.080]   I know I'm on Wi-Fi right now because my network.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.640]   Yeah, you boy, we used to used to look so good.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.600]   Sorry about that.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.160]   Well, I thought in honor of my Apollo pick, I'm giving you a simulation of what it was
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.840]   like to have a lot of video from the Apollo crew module.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.120]   Well, there are 180,000 miles away from Earth.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:31.920]   But it's so the advantage is that I like having, I like uploading my pictures.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.880]   I like being able to write more than two sentences about it because sometimes I want to kind
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.720]   of blog about it more than anything else.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.760]   I want to be able to have control over who gets to see it, whether it's the entire world,
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.520]   my friends and family, just my family, that sort of stuff.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.080]   So point for point for point for point.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.960]   If you want to make use of your pictures, I think that Flickr was the only one that really
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.520]   covered all those bases in one service.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.960]   If you want to put all your photos in one place, that's always been for me the place
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.760]   to put it.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:03.400]   The only bad thing about it is that it's always had this 2005, 2006, 2007 interface.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.920]   And now they have something that's really, really lovely, very, very pretty, I had it
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.080]   in front of me and then I navigated away from it so I could.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.960]   So you pay $50 for a year and the only thing you get is no ads.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.800]   And the 500, it's only one extra terabyte in.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.480]   And you double the amount for one terabyte.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.760]   So there's no unlimited at all anymore.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.480]   Except the people like us are grandfathered in.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   Right.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.640]   But given that the service doesn't support uploading to begin with, you're always talking
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   about JPEGs.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.840]   A terabyte, it's an awful lot.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.320]   That's one hell of a lot of pictures.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Why would you pay me that?
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.760]   I'd show $450 more for two terabytes.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   I don't know.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.120]   Well, also, is there anything about video in there?
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.960]   It seems like the basic account gives you three minutes of video.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.720]   Does you get more video from 500 bucks?
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:59.360]   They've expanded this top to bottom where now there's also they've expanded the limits
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.360]   for HD video.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:06.120]   Now you can get 10 or like a Vimeo sort of effect, longer videos, higher resolution.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   And again, it still comes up on your normal cap there.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:15.400]   Part of the reason I don't know, it's so-- it's cuckoo-cuckoo because it's not linear.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   It's a very crazy thing.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:21.360]   And as a pro user, they actually encourage you to discontinue your pro account and go
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.920]   back to the free account.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.800]   And they'll rebate you.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.640]   And so both-- neither of these are available if you're a pro user.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.960]   Makes the kind of sense that doesn't.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.440]   It's crazy.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.400]   Now Google also redid it's Google+.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.400]   I think it's beautiful.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.200]   It took me a little while to get used to it.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.560]   I spend most of my time, most of my social time on Google+.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.560]   I am now.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.560]   I've been using it a lot.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.560]   I've kind of loved it.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:49.040]   I love the new-- when you go to share and it kind of just pops into a window that you
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   can-- anyway, it's--
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.800]   It's very lovely.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.960]   It's pretty cool.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.040]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   I think that it's-- this is a bit modern.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.720]   It's a two lane highway now.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.960]   Now, one of the things you guys--
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   Three.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.320]   Depending on your-- on your opponent, you're on a retina and you're seeing three.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:15.480]   One of the other things that's interesting from an Apple point of view is Hangouts.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:20.680]   They're going after a unified messaging solution, which really pretty much goes directly against
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.360]   Apple's messenger messages.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.760]   Well, and it's really set up that you can do anything.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   You want to call someone, you want to have a video chat, you want to have a text chat.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.320]   It's all-- it's really becoming kind of a unified experience.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.320]   Right.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.400]   One killer more than even an iMessage killer.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   There's been so many things.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.040]   And on top of everything else, it's almost like having a private social network just for
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.880]   this one conversation you're having with your two friends and it can go on forever.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.320]   That's one of the things I like about it.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.080]   This is like one solution for 100 different things.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.640]   And if Apple finds a need to improve messages at this point, that's a huge win for every
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:58.320]   Apple user because I think that's been kind of a stagnant after a while and sort of trying
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.480]   to encourage the friends of mine that only want to be connected via iMessage to sort of
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:07.160]   could-- I talk you into using something else.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.320]   It's hard because the Apple stuff is all integrated.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.600]   I mean, I guess the problem that I have is that it's so easy to have the right device
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.400]   in my hand because you're using a system that only works with one.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.720]   It's cross-platform for iOS and Android, but there was nothing for Blackberry or Windows
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   phone.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:24.480]   So it's not really anything killer yet until I think they go everywhere.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.640]   Because you want to make sure you include that 5%.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.400]   Now, supposedly they're going to add SMS messaging, which would then make it fully cross-platform.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.840]   I mean, not as full-featured on Windows or Bibi Blackberry, but-- So you remember I asked
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:45.120]   about the 50 billion apps, how do they know-- do they really know the 50 billionth?
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:50.000]   And by the way, Google, of course, responded at Google I/O with 48 billion downloads.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   E2, E2, E2, E2.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:05.760]   So there's a post by a guy named Benedict Evans who actually charted all of this and plotted
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   the data sets.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.360]   And actually, that looks like they're pretty parallel, doesn't it?
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:14.080]   Like Android and Apple growing roughly the same pace.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.440]   Well, Android's growing a lot faster.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.240]   I mean, it's just the raw number of people getting into a lot of devices.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.720]   Well, do you think it's going to be a hockey stick that this elbow is going to turn into
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:28.600]   suddenly-- I think it's going to keep on going up.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.520]   Anyway, and Chad, you said they talked about how they counted it?
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.520]   Right.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.960]   So they talked about which apps they counted.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.120]   Because Apple never revealed this information.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   Right.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.640]   And he says through an email correspondence they did.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   And so--
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   This is from the next web.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   They actually wrote to them.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   Right.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.920]   And so if you have bought an app, that counts as an app download.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.800]   And then if you install it on multiple devices--
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   Correct.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.720]   So if you install it on your iPad, your iPhone, then that's one download, app download.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.440]   That's both Google and Apple do it that way.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.440]   Correct.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:09.880]   And then also, their apps that they include bundled on the device is not counted in that
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.880]   number.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.480]   So whenever you have the iPod app, that's never counted.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:20.120]   On top of that, the apps that are given to you by Apple for free, so like the podcasting
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:24.560]   app, that would count because you have to go and download it.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:31.120]   And then that's pretty much true for both Apple and Google in terms of bundled apps
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.120]   on the device.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   So if your Google does offer--
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.840]   For download some of its bundled apps--
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:36.840]   Correct.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:37.840]   Whereas Apple does not.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   Correct.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   Correct.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   And--
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.840]   That's on counts.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:47.480]   Apparently the 50 billionth download was buy OK go, buy OK go.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.960]   Those guys.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.400]   I love these guys.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.080]   They made a word game called say the same thing.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.600]   This was the 50 billionth app.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.440]   They're like a Renaissance band.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   Renaissance groups.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.320]   I mean, not only do they do those great videos, and they really became big because of that
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.720]   treadmill video that they put on YouTube.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   Still amazing.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:12.440]   But now they have a word game app with, by the way, it's free with in-game purchases.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.960]   Add freeze to 99, 20 bananas for a buck.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.600]   I've bought enough donuts for a lifetime.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   I'm not buying any bananas.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.600]   It's like grandfaldywindleo.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.160]   You should get a limited donuts at some point.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   I should.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.400]   I had a scare last night.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.320]   I was trying to get Simpsons to work.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.080]   And I guess the origin servers were down because it wouldn't let me log in.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.920]   I thought, no!
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.360]   So I have a dream.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.040]   Maybe you can help me with this dream.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.160]   I want to make a giant printout of my Simpsons land.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.400]   So in order to do that--
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.480]   I'll just have to do high risk screenshots.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.480]   This is going to be so hard.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   I'm going to do that.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.920]   And then move it.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.760]   And then stitch them together with Photoshop.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.120]   The hard part is taking photos.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.480]   And then you have a big-- yeah, I'll do that.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.480]   Then you have a big printer.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.640]   I don't have a huge printer.
[00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   I have 19.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.600]   I have that Epson 19 by 14 print.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.240]   I can get-- there's a guy in-- there's a guy I know.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.480]   A guy who knows a guy who can print it on a cloth that's like as big as mine.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   I have a small dream.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480]   It's a dream.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   So send me all the components.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480]   We'll put it together.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   I'll stitch it into a big photo and then I'll send you the big print.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   And I'll have it printed.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.480]   And I'll make this high resolution.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.200]   So you want to print it at one to one scale?
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   So I can walk around in it.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200]   Part of it.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.200]   It wasn't there Steven Wright.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   Hey, Omar.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.200]   Hey, Bart.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.880]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.200]   Here in Petaloma, we used a signed company, Barber Science, to print out the OMG Craft
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   Set.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.620]   And they could print it on vinyl so you could keep it with you because paper's going to
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.620]   crinkle.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.620]   Good thinking?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.800]   I wonder if Photoshop would stitch that together automatically.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.800]   You know the stitching function there?
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.600]   I'm going to do this week and tap down.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600]   No, that's what I was planning.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.200]   Just throw it in there and just hit go.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   No, I will.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.440]   That's exactly what I'm going to do because I'll just make sure I have a little bit around
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   each edge that's overlapping.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   About 20%, 30% overlap.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.840]   Yeah, it should be able to stitch it.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840]   How about a tattoo?
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   Even in sections you might have to do it.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   A tattoo would be good.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.120]   But the key is to get the land because it's so perfect right now.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120]   It's so perfect.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120]   And you want to capture that moment?
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.120]   I want to capture it.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120]   It's perfect.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   Before it all goes, before everyone starts rebelling.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120]   Yes.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   It's small.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.120]   Completing.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120]   Completing.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   It is my little utopia.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.240]   By the way, do not recommend this program.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.000]   It's available on iPhone and iPad.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.720]   I do not recommend this because I've spent so much time.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.360]   I've spent way too much money.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.200]   But really, if you think about it, the amount of time I've spent on it is really the cost.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.720]   It's Leo's Candy Crush.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.800]   It is Candy Crush, which is I will not play.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   No.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.880]   I will not play Candy Crush.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   I really manage my--
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.800]   Another freemium app that I will not play.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   I have to do things that will stop quickly.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   Like, Plants vs. Zombies, Field Runners.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.680]   Well, I'm trying to finish this game before Plants vs. Zombies 2 comes out because I know
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   I'll be completely consumed by that.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.440]   Tapped out is so great.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.520]   Anyway, so I need an invention.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.520]   I really do.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   Anyway.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.360]   That was my Plants vs. Zombies.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.320]   Yeah, now I'm all I can think of as harvesting corn.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   All right.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.560]   Let's move on.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.520]   Let's move on.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520]   We have a shadow title.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.120]   Yeah, all I can think about is harvesting corn.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.160]   It's kind of sad when you get to a certain age.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.640]   Oh, that's what I was going to say.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.040]   It is a utopia.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.320]   And that's why I like it.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.860]   Because as rough and crazy as this modern world of ours can be, I know they'll always
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.000]   become there in spring.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   They'll always be donuts.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.680]   There'll always be donuts.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.840]   Here's another example of change I don't like.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.440]   How many times have you and I gone down to that Union Square or the Apple Store across
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   from Virgin?
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.880]   Well, I used to go almost every day because it was a block from my office.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   Well, you've moved out too.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880]   I have.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.400]   They're moving it to Union Square.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.840]   They're moving it one block.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.600]   I don't care.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.400]   You know, my complaint about that is, but not tall enough.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.040]   There's not enough Apple.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.200]   According to the San Francisco Chronicles website, the SF gate, they're going to do
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   in San Francisco.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:07.000]   It really is in many ways their flagship store, because San Francisco is so close to Apple.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.520]   It was on Stockton and Ellis right there on Market Street.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.360]   It was a nice location, but it wasn't a pretty store.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.480]   It was one of the first Apple stores.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.800]   This one's going to be more of a glass box, kind of like to compete with some of the
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   new works.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   It's one point out.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   The Ginza store is like four stories.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   Five stories high.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   This looks like a mere two stories.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.880]   You know, I'm wondering if it's a limit to the height that they're allowed to go.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.880]   Because I think that's the same height as the old Levi's.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.200]   They're probably doing one of those little things.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.160]   In San Francisco, there's so many building codes that a lot of people will literally
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:44.320]   just put the roof right where it is and then raise everything below it and build everything
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320]   under it.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.240]   That way it's not a new construction.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.200]   So I bet you that's what they're doing there.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.160]   There actually, this is a big year for Apple retail.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.800]   20 stores in the US will be renovated this year and they're opening 30 new stores, mostly
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   outside the US as they continue to have huge success.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   We just thought a new one.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   Did you?
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   In Montreal?
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.400]   Yeah, right across Montreal Island and then on the mainland, they just put a new one on
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   Brassard, which is amazing.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.600]   I mean, I have to say with the whole stores, the idea of running one retail store kind
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   of overwhelms me.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   We don't have one.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   I know.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   We think about it.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   We talk about like, what would you sell?
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.600]   Like live streaming equipment.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.240]   Oh, you know, like, like, like we do solutions.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.240]   We're really good at it.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.080]   You know, we have some skill stick to your knitting.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.080]   We are pretty, you know, when we built, we're now building our business.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.800]   I told Apple, I told Apple, I pulled them aside.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.240]   I said, do not open retail stores.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   Look what happened to Gateway.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   It's a terrible idea.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   Look at Dell.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   Look at Dell.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   It's a horrible idea.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240]   I know I'm a visionary.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.880]   On a square foot basis, again, Apple is the killer.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:47.280]   New record retail revenues, Horace Dediyu at Asymco has new, a new graph.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:54.440]   It is doing twice as well as number two, which is Tiffany, three times as well as Lulu-Lemannath-Letica.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:01.040]   Seven percent growth in visitors, a new record revenue of $57.6 per visitor.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.520]   I'm way over that average.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:09.640]   The average revenue per Apple store per quarter, $13 million.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.200]   Now it goes, it's a little peaky if you look at that graph because of course, Holler's
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:24.760]   or yeah, average visitor per store, a quarter million per store per quarter.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.760]   That's significant.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   Those are good numbers.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.480]   Just in case you're wondering if you're wondering how to measure these things, those
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.600]   are it's up like the 30 percent.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.120]   Employment has studied at about 110 per store, although the San Francisco store will have
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.600]   400 employees.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.400]   I still have no retail vice president.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.560]   I guess they decided not to hire Ron Johnson back.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.200]   I was kind of surprised they didn't bring him back.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   I guess.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.120]   Profit per visitor, $12 a quarter.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.840]   Apple store openings by country, US is brown in this graph.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.040]   It's the big one, but then you see Sweden.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040]   Who doesn't total store?
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.040]   Who has a total store?
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040]   There's a number of openings.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040]   New stores per year.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040]   Really amazing.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.560]   Don't you love how the analyst has to factor in?
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.160]   It might be limited by the fire codes.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.120]   How many people?
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.720]   How many retailers have the problem of?
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.760]   Unfortunately, fire codes prohibit us from allowing more than four people per square
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.400]   foot inside the store.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.440]   We'd like to make more, but the law prohibits.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.560]   They definitely have Facebook machines.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.640]   I will say I've been to a lot of Apple stores around the world and they're always in the
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.880]   most outrageous places.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.080]   You know, the one in New York is just outstanding.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.280]   Have you guys been to the fifth avenue or the one in Soho?
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.120]   No, the one in the train station.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120]   Oh, Grand Central.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.680]   It looks like Grand Central is the Apple store.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.280]   Like, is it because it's opened into it and it just looks like, well, we have an Apple
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   market.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.320]   Yeah, it's like there's a grand staircase at either end of Grand Central Station.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.920]   It's intended that as was intended just to move commuters in and out of the place, but
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.520]   one of them happens to be now the entrance to the entire Apple store.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520]   That's incredible.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.080]   It's like the first time I visited, I really walk past that staircase three times.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.320]   I figured, well, no, this can't be the entrance of the store.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.480]   There must be an elevator or a slight no, then.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.800]   Like a cathedral.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.280]   One of the things Google rolled out at Google I/O is a Google All Access music service.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.840]   It's kind of a radio service like we thought Apple would be doing any day now.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:22.120]   Apparently, Apple still aiming for a summer rollout of some sort of I radio.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:28.280]   According to a Paul Sloan running in CNET, the issue is with Sony trying to figure out
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.800]   how much Apple would pay for songs that people listen to a tiny bit of and then skip.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.800]   I do that a lot.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800]   I do it too.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800]   Skipper's dilemma.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.640]   Well, my thing is, I think that Google, I don't know, I'm really a big fan of Spotify.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.520]   So if I'm going to do something that's more like that.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.520]   I mean, I think that--
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520]   Did you try the Google All Access?
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.520]   It's very Spotify-like.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520]   I'm going to try.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   I love it.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.080]   I think it's better than Spotify.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.160]   For me, it's better than Spotify.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.560]   I don't want a separate app.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.200]   I want all my music in one place.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:01.040]   I love the fact that-- I love the fact that I can sort of borrow an album for under subscription
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.920]   and then after realizing that, well, actually, you've listened to the full Sweeney Town Broadway
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.400]   cast recording, Sweeney Todd recording eight times of the past week.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.400]   Okay.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.840]   So I don't move that into something I've actually bought.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   Right.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   It's $7.99 if you subscribe before June.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.240]   Chris Green, you're a musician.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.360]   What is the attitude of musicians towards this kind of stuff?
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.800]   I think that-- I mean, I love streaming services.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.800]   I have them all.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.800]   As a listener.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   Except this one.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.880]   And I really think it's wonderful.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.440]   And I think the real advantage of Google coming up with this and Apple, depending on how
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.880]   they handle it, is that people will finally say, oh, this is a legitimate thing.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.520]   I think a lot of people have not jumped on to something like Spotify or MOG or already
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.680]   or Rhapsody because they're sort of that psychological barrier of, oh, I have to give
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.200]   them my credit card and sign up for this thing.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.640]   If you're already part of Google's ecosystem or Apple's where you just click a button and
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.720]   say, oh, yeah, I want this as an option.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.800]   It's terrific.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.000]   And then especially if you use Sonos, you do have that integrated experience where you're
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.120]   not using an app at all.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.440]   You just have your Sonos app.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.760]   And you just say, yeah, I want to listen to this album.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.920]   Oh, it's on Spotify, great.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.200]   I'll listen there or it's on Google Play.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.480]   I'll listen there when they bring that in there.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.680]   So I do think that a lot of people are going to jump on this thing more than they did.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.400]   So I think there has been this attitude of rent my music.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.640]   No, that's obscene and I won't.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.440]   Having companies like Google and Apple in there, I think it's going to make a huge difference
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   to this.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:33.920]   I think there was also this kind of feeling like maybe this is illegal or anyway, the kind
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.000]   of continued presumption that they're not paying enough to musicians.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.760]   That's why I ask you as a musician because Spotify doesn't pay very much for.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760]   Right.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.160]   Pandora's Pandora's the worst.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.240]   So they say they're the best.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.840]   They say we pay more than half of our revenues to musicians.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.600]   Well, that may be.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.680]   But no, if you look at, they'll graph this out for you.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   So I think they did Lady Gaga track or something where they said, now this is what we got from
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.640]   us down right a sale.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   And here's what we got from Spotify for the quarter and it was like $6.31.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.720]   Well, I think that the issue is I think we're very quickly moving towards where the community
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.720]   is the content.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.080]   You know, and if you don't, if you're not using your content to create community, you're
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.160]   going to be in, I mean, Lady Gaga arguably already does that.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.400]   She's very huge following.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.160]   And so the people who come into your concerts are paying your bills, not the people buying
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.160]   your album.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.000]   And I think that as we move to the subscription services, this is going to become more.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.400]   And although, according to this article and seen that, one of the reasons music labels
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.320]   like Apple perhaps better than Spotify or maybe Google is that there are other revenue
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.160]   opportunities, Apple will always say, you like this song, you can buy it.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.960]   So they've got iTunes, so they've got the sales bill.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   And Google has that.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.240]   And I don't know if they do that currently in the all access, but they could.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.200]   Apple also has told the music labels that it plans to build out its iAdd business, including
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.880]   the potential of adding audio ads into the radio stream.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   That would be awesome.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   Oh, wait.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   No, it wouldn't be.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   No.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.560]   I mean, I guess right now, I mean, there's definitely things I'd love to see in a new
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:11.360]   service, but unless, you know, a lot of the social searching and, you know, the ability
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.640]   to have individuals really get playlists, I think one of the problems right now is that
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   in Spotify is fine.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.200]   You can share your playlists and everything else.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.320]   But I think that what's missing right now is a financial incentive for people to share
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.880]   playlists where they're actually getting a little bit of something.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.720]   And that would, if we really got into that where people could make their own little business,
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.200]   when I say little business, I mean, like to make an extra $200 a month or something like
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.120]   that on the fact that they built up this huge following and you create, I think this moving
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:46.200]   defining ways to socially share and generate new, you know, interest in music is something
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.480]   I think is missing from all these.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.400]   And I don't, I don't see anyone doing it, but I think that that is the only missing
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.800]   because right for me right now, Spotify completely killed my interest in buying.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.480]   I mean, there's the two, the two like media crushing apps, in my opinion, is flip board
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.200]   and Spotify because when I got flip board, I stopped reading magazines.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.880]   And when I got Spotify, I stopped buying music.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.640]   I think Pandora did that for me.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.840]   Pandora did it for me because I kept on stopping me from skipping.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.320]   I was like, yeah, you can only skip as soon as I could get Spotify and download like tons
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   and tons of music.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.360]   And listen to whatever I want, when I want how I want, I was like, I'm done.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.520]   And songs on Sonos is fantastic.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.960]   Love songs, I also have that and songs that has all these curated streams.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   Pandora repeats a lot.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.400]   I have, you know, if when I listen to Fleetwood Max station, I'm going to get the same five
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.600]   songs in the first half hour every single time.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.720]   Yeah, I use Pandora for discovery, but I kind of stop using it because most of what I like
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.000]   to use music for is really to have control over my playlists.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.040]   And that's the reason why I do, you know, I do have a Spotify account.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.520]   The reason why I don't really use it that much for like regular regular playlists is
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.560]   that I like the fact that at some point I own this song, it is an unlocked DRM file that
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.960]   I can do whatever I want with on whatever app I want with from now until two days before
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.960]   I'm forgetting.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.520]   And I don't like the idea that I won't have access to this really carefully curated playlist
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.720]   I've been spending years putting together unless I keep coming up with that monthly
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   feed.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:13.080]   Yeah, although that I have to say that is my number one listened to Spotify playlist
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:19.560]   is Andy Inako's one song which you put on Google plus like two years ago.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.600]   I don't remember when you did that, but you said if you could only have one song that
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.920]   you would listen to and there's hundreds of songs in it.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.920]   It's great.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.720]   It's a Spotify playlist.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.720]   So thank you.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.720]   I should do that again.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.720]   That's always useful.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.720]   Awesome.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.520]   It does show you like how scary different it is to be marketing music these days because
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.160]   I love the fact that I have lots of Twitter followers mean that if once a year every couple
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.560]   of years I say recommend one song and one song only you can't say this album or here
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560]   are three.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.840]   You have to put all of your marbles onto one song.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.000]   I get some of my favorite songs and my favorite playlist are things where people just had
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.160]   to say I will give you only one and this is it.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:02.280]   And the ability to sample it for 30 seconds to see what it's all about or go on Spotify
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.160]   or on Google Play and listen to the entire thing and know that yes, I know why this person
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160]   like this song.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160]   It is awesome.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.960]   And the other thing you should do it every year because it changes.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.440]   My one song would not be the same this year that it was last year.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.600]   It was the one song I really liked last year.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.560]   I will definitely do that tomorrow.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.040]   I don't want to put up that call.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   All right.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.400]   I'll be watching and you'll put it on Spotify as a playlist.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.200]   That was it was like you could see groups.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.320]   You could crowdsource a playlist, right?
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.400]   I like to curate it a little bit.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.800]   Not a big bit.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.760]   Just they're there somewhere again.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.720]   If it's a wild man fisher song, maybe people don't want to encounter that.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.320]   Oh, come on.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320]   Christmas tree.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320]   Come on.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320]   Christmas tree.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   No, no, no, no.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.320]   Merry go round is awesome.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.760]   Put that on the list, please.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:53.760]   Well, okay.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.120]   So if I was thinking of Russia's Tom Sur, would you let me put that one on?
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.120]   Yes.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120]   Okay.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   Of course.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.120]   Checking.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   Come on.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.400]   Russia's I was just listening to Russia.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.400]   I was just listening to it.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.040]   It came on the radio or something like that.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.040]   It's one of those songs.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.040]   I haven't listened to the song.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040]   It's a long time.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   It comes up on the radio and you're going to go.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.400]   Our show today actually Tim Cook auction ended $610,000.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.200]   Just thought you'd like to know some quickies here.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.720]   I'd be asking him anything for you, Leo.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.040]   Did you buy that?
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.040]   Good man.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040]   On the corporate.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   Bidding me by 10 grand.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   I was very upset.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   It really should have been a journalist, right?
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040]   Because what a great chance to get a great exclusive interview.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040]   That coffee would have been really short.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   Yeah, I know.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.800]   Exospeo's are the worst.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   The worst.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:45.400]   US Air Force expects to save $50 million by buying 18,000 iPads.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   Well played.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.400]   Well played.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.360]   It's called government math, my friend.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360]   Excellent.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.760]   This is why they're asking to have before more money.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:03.520]   One pilot says it was an iPhone that almost brought down the plane that killed the navigation.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:08.800]   And it was a no, you know, it was a regional airline.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.360]   I got something in my nose climbing.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360]   A thousand feet.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.400]   Well, you don't want to be the guy.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.240]   The company is going haywire.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.600]   No one's turned their own until a flight attendant persuaded a passenger in row nine.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.160]   Such BS to switch off the iPhone.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.320]   The pilot told the NASA aviation safety reporting system.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.560]   The timing of the cell phone being turned off coincided exactly with the moment where
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.520]   our compasses started working again.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.800]   This pilot is over 70 years old.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800]   C9.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.800]   I probably can't remember what was actually going on in the first place.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.840]   I've heard about these things.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.840]   You show phone.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.000]   No, they're going to bring the plane down.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.920]   They got iPads in the cockpit with it.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.920]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.920]   No one turns their phone off.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.320]   Here's the problem is that 30% admit that guy don't turn our phones off.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   I don't even think about it.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.960]   I mean, it's like the only the only people to turn the phone off is the people you don't
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.360]   want to be the guy responsible for bringing the plane down.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   I'm not.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360]   I'm not going to feel that way.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.800]   Learning decided if I fly enough, I have to think about it.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   When you have a turn, you do.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.800]   I'm excited.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.080]   If the plane's going down, I've decided that I'm going to put my hands up and go, "Whoo-hoo!"
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080]   All the way down.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   That was sweet.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.040]   I was sitting in so pilot on my way home and he didn't turn his phone off.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.080]   Oh, yeah, there you go.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080]   No.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.800]   But Alex brings up a value proposition.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.080]   If you turn the phone off, like when you're asked to, that means that there's maybe less
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.400]   chance of causing the plane to crash.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.680]   However, if you leave the phone on and it does cause the plane to crash, you won't
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.720]   have to wait for the phone to boot up to send that last SMS to your family.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   Exactly.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   Now that is some thinking.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.320]   They'll never trace it to you.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.120]   They will never say to you, "This guy's phone."
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.120]   Oh, sure they will.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120]   No, they do.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.160]   They would find out whose phone is on.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160]   And I mess with them.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.840]   The problem is, is they're going to find out whose phone is on.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.560]   It's going to be 100 people on the...
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.800]   If they could figure out that Denzel Washington drank three vodka's in flight, they could figure
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.160]   out whose iPhone that was out of all when they know.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.360]   Because they walk through trying to figure it out.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.720]   The funny thing is, is that they're going to have little detectors.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   The only person, there's like a...
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.640]   We call it the penalty box, which is that if you get caught using your phone when they're
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.280]   taking off right before, like when they're taxing around, then the stewardess will sit
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.960]   there and show the flight attendant will sit there and make you...
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.280]   The watch you turn it off.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280]   Right.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.280]   But outside of that, everyone's off.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.280]   So the key is, it's like this thing.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.280]   And we're...
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.280]   You know, anyways...
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:28.320]   I've got Johnny Jett, our travel guru, yelled at me because I said, "I put it in...
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.000]   I put it in the airplane mode and I put it in the stand, but I don't...
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.560]   Told press and hold it.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.560]   Slide the turn off."
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.560]   I'm texting all the way to 10,000 people.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.560]   You're...
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.560]   You're going to bring the plane?
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.560]   You know, there's money though.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.680]   So on the last flight from LA, the pilot's doing his thing and talking about Wi-Fi.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.560]   And he's like, "As soon as we take off, you can..."
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560]   You can...
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.120]   I can't remember his name.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.280]   I apologize if you're listening because he...
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.480]   I could have sworn that he'd said Macbreak.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.480]   Oh, sure.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480]   Like you can get in a Wi-Fi and out on Macbreak.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.120]   A lot of pilots listen.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.440]   And when I got off, he was from Southwest and I were going crazy right now, by the way.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.440]   And he said that...
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.640]   He said, "Did you hear my Macbreak mentioned?"
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   You know, and so...
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.440]   He said Macbreak on the Southwest.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.240]   Oh, this is South West.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.040]   So when you get to a flight...
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040]   When we get to a flight...
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   10,000 feet.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040]   You can...
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.040]   You're not a lischen of Macbreak.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   Right.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   It's great.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.040]   With Alex Lynch, the guy in Rohnon.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040]   But it went by so fast, I wasn't sure if anyone had really said anything and it turned out to be.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040]   Well, plus also Alex.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.040]   Alex, Alex, we've also determined that you're someone who does not listen to Macbreak.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.040]   Listen to the instructions.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.040]   See, now I will.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040]   I'm never going to get...
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040]   I really should not have said that.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040]   I'm sure.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.040]   I'm just speaking as I remember.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.120]   I do turn off the phone more often than not.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.640]   Only because I think that on principle, it's a good idea to do what the flight attendants
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   tell you to do.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   Yes.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.960]   Because there was this PBS special on like on Airline Crashes that just stuck with me.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.800]   I must have seen it when I was 16, 17, 18.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.920]   And it's basically if you just listen to what...
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.920]   If I had to tend to sort of categorize you when you're bored as the person who listens
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.520]   and does what you tell them to do and the person who's just going to cause problems.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.720]   And not that they're going to like say, "Okay, people who listen to us, go to the door that
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.520]   I tell you first on the slide."
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.040]   Go to the lunch with the fire on it.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.600]   Well, I just don't want to get scolded.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.600]   That's all.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:19.600]   I do admit that when spending a lot of time in airports, you do watch people argue like
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.600]   in Yale.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.360]   And you really have to understand is like everything...
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.960]   Every person that you talk to from the person that you're picking your ticket up to, to TSA,
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.080]   to the flight attendant, they have an enormous number of subjective decisions to make.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.080]   Subjective.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.120]   As in, they can make the call on the ground.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   They can hurt.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:43.560]   And you messing with them is not going to improve your experience of your trip.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:47.080]   So they're good universal rules.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.400]   One of them is to smile to people in the service industry.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.760]   If for no other reason than for every person who smiles at them, there are probably three
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.640]   people who gave them a hard time for no adequately explained reason.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.560]   Again, they could use them smiling.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560]   Yes.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.840]   We're going to take a result in the first class upgrade yet, but I'm still hoping.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.120]   Before you switch with your 9-5, Mack Markerman's usually got good sources.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.000]   Flicker and Vimeo integration and iOS 7, he's saying.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   Ooh, okay.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   Let me think about that.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   Flicker and Vimeo.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.600]   Now, YouTube has already integrated where you press a button and uploads to YouTube.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.600]   That kind of integration.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.240]   Yeah, this would be Share Sheet the same way that Twitter and Facebook is.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240]   Share Sheet.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   Good.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240]   I like it.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.120]   We're going to let Alex and Zico do you want to quickly do a pick before you run?
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.120]   Last pass.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.120]   Okay, thanks.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.600]   If you haven't used it, you're crazy if you haven't used it.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.480]   Doug Dalton made me try it and I complained about it because I was like, "God, I can't
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.440]   keep on forgetting my password and everything, but now that I got it working in the world."
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   We share them.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.320]   You can share codes with everybody so I can log in and grab all the codes for all of our
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.960]   elementals and everything else.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   It's great.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   Last pass.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.960]   Last pass.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   Buck a month or free if you're cheap.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   I put my mom on it.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.120]   The whole company's on it.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.480]   She had a file on her desktop.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.160]   She came to visit last month.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   Said passwords.doc.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:03.040]   Says that mom, "We're going to work on this."
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.400]   And then I thought I had a scare because she called me from the airport saying, "My
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.760]   laptop and my iPad were stolen on the security belt."
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.400]   And I freaked because I had not removed, I set her up on LastPass, but I had yet to remove
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.120]   passwords.doc.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.800]   And I thought, "Did I give her a login?"
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.960]   And I immediately changed all her passwords and then I realized, "Oh, it's in my trunk.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   It fell out of the suitcase."
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.200]   The only thing you have to be careful with the last pass is making sure that you turn
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.200]   it off so it's not auto.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.280]   You never put your password into it.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.440]   Just have a good password that you can remember, but that's hard to guess.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440]   Exactly.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.440]   Which I have.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440]   Okay.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440]   Bye bye guys.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   Good.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay from PIXELCORE.com for taking a break.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.480]   Come back with the rest of you guys' pics.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.520]   In a moment, our show today brought to you by the good folks at Shutter's Stock.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:52.440]   I did a blog post, first time in almost a year yesterday, to promote the fact that we were
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.120]   going to do our live coverage of the Xbox thing.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.520]   And I thought, "Oh, I forgot I got my Shutter's Stock account."
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.840]   And I got a nice little image of an Xbox controller drawn.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:07.320]   It's actually pretty nice if you go to leoville.com/Iguysblog.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.640]   I don't know how to go there and see.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.560]   It's in the news section so it doesn't show up on the front.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.680]   But it's really cute.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.560]   And I reminded me how great Shutter's Stock is.
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.440]   If you need images, if you're a blogger, every post, I know this.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.600]   Every post has to have an image.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:28.800]   If you have a publication, boy, I just tell you, it is a really great source.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.680]   20 million high quality stock photos, illustrations, vectors, video clips, all royalty free, all
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.840]   very affordable.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.600]   And they have a great search engine, which I have to say I'm really fond of, which lets
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.080]   you search for anything.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.680]   So I searched for Happy Xbox.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.320]   And I got the little controller.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.160]   I love that.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:58.040]   You can search by not just subject, but by color, by emotion, by all sorts of stuff.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:04.160]   The emotion, the color is a spectrum tool that lets you, if you're a designer, put together
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:11.000]   all of the collateral that you want in a certain style, you can save it into your lightbox.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.520]   And by the way, it's free to create an account and to have a lightbox and share the lightbox
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.160]   with other members of your team to collect ideas.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.240]   So I've been doing that for a while on my Shutter Stock account.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.560]   I collect all of the different images that I want into a lightbox.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.840]   I think I might want to use it to a lightbox, so I have quick access to them.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.800]   Shutter Stock is a great deal with great images.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.240]   They have a variety of ways to get individual image packs.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.920]   What I did is a monthly subscription.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:43.600]   My 25 images a day is probably overkill, but 25 images a day, a subscription.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.560]   And you can get 30% off any of those packages right now.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.440]   If you visit ShutterStock.com and use our offer code MACBRAKE in the number five, again,
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440]   it's free to sign up.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440]   What did you look for?
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   Bunnies?
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.280]   These animals and wildlife.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.720]   So you see there, there's photos, there's vector art.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.960]   It's because you've got 20 million things, it's the variety is astounding.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.440]   It's fabulous.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440]   Try it.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.920]   ShutterStock.com, free to sign up, free to make a lightbox and play with a spectrum in the
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.920]   search tool.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.920]   Actually, I should update this.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.480]   It's now 25 million stock photos, illustrations, vectors and videos.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.040]   ShutterStock.com, they add 10,000 images a day, so there's always going to be something
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   new.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040]   Look at that gorilla.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   I like that.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.480]   I'm going to use that on my next blog post.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.560]   It's actually, you know, I've been trying to think of ways to kind of stimulate creativity
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.360]   to get me to post more.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:37.320]   And that's, I make a lightbox with images like that gorilla saying, now write a post about
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.760]   it that this would be applied to.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.920]   And it really is fun that way.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.600]   Yeah, it really gets going.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.160]   And because there's so many images, whatever your creative mind is thinking of, you just
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.320]   find it, something there.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.640]   Macbreak 5 is our offer code for 30% off when you do decide to buy.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.000]   It's Tam Nalf or ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.760]   Our picks of the week, we heard from Alex Lindsey because he had to rush off, but let's get
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.080]   over to Chris Breen and besides Wildman Fisher, what is, what's turning you on these days?
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.800]   Well, besides Wildman Fisher, I am, I am, I have a device that you could listen to Wildman
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   Fisher.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.560]   And all its digital glory.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.840]   So you get every nuance of Larry's spectacular vocals.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.680]   And it's called the Dragonfly.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.480]   This is a $250 USB digital audio converter.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.280]   It's USB, so comes on, little cap comes off there.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.520]   It's Tyncy.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.760]   It's Tyncy.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   And the glorious thing about it is that in your laptop, whether you have a computer, whether
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:43.360]   you have a Windows PC or a Mac, the sound circuitry in there is kind of not so great.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:47.640]   And so if you're an audio file kind of person and you're the sort of person that would purchase
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:53.320]   a digital audio converter box to put next to your computer, you don't have to anymore.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.880]   You can get this USB stick.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.280]   It supports 44.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:02.000]   148.2 kilohertz and 96 kilohertz.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.880]   It makes sure that the audio data is transferred perfectly.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.640]   And you just simply plug it into your computer.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:16.040]   You plug in a 3.5 millimeter plug in there.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.560]   And you can use it with headphones.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.920]   It also has a variable output.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.740]   So if you want, you can plug it into powered speakers.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.980]   You could plug it into an input on your very expensive receiver or amplifier.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:31.780]   And it really does improve the sound of your music coming out of your computer in glorious
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.780]   ways.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.820]   And not simply that you have to use FLAC files or on VORBIS files, but it improves the
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:43.020]   sound of MP3 files, AAC files, certainly AIFF and WAV files.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.900]   It is expensive at 250.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:50.260]   But if you really care about the music coming out of your computer, it's a wonderful device.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:56.740]   You know, I have that setup where you have my MacBook retina and the 27-inch display
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.020]   and you keep the retina closed.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:01.620]   And I didn't want to put-- I wanted to put the sound to come out of the USB port because
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.340]   I didn't want to have to take sound out of the laptop.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.820]   So I got a DAC.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:06.980]   But it wasn't one of these.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:09.340]   It was from FiIO.
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:10.540]   But there is a difference in the quality.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:13.140]   I mean, you might say 250 bucks.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:15.780]   But the quality of the chips use the DSP chips in these.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.860]   It varies widely.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860]   And you're a musician.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.740]   I'm impressed you if you say the Dragonfly is the best.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:21.740]   That's the one.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:22.740]   It's a good thing to have.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.420]   Thank you for the recommendation.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:27.420]   Mr. Renee Ritchie.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:32.540]   You kind of teased it already, but my pick is the new Google Hangouts app.
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:36.700]   It's a bit confusingly named because Google Hangouts are part of Google+, but the Hangouts
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:42.540]   is a new, distinct, separate app for iOS that launched last week right after Google
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.100]   I/O's keynote.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.780]   And it's basically what we said earlier.
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:49.540]   It's a way to combine a lot of different Google communication tools in one.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.020]   So you can text messages.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.300]   You can do text messages in a group messages, video calls.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.820]   You can do Hangouts.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:00.580]   One of the things I like best about iMessage is that I can do it on my Mac and on my iOS
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.580]   device.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:05.660]   And with the Google Hangouts app, when you do text into there, if you have Jabra set
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.540]   up in messages or another client on your Mac, you can do conversations on both at the
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:14.500]   same time there too, which for me is a big productivity boom.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.220]   And I've tried it out with numerous people.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:18.780]   The video quality is great.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:19.780]   It's fast.
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:24.540]   It seems to keep everything in nice, chronological order, which can't always be said about every
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.220]   text-based app.
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.220]   And it looks the design.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.220]   I mean, Google's been raising their design game on iOS for a while, and arguably, iOS
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.300]   apps look-- Google apps on iOS look better than the Android versions these days.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:40.420]   And that's not always true, but the Google Hangout app is gorgeous.
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:43.460]   There's still a few bugs because it's brand new.
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:49.460]   Let me try to call myself, and then said I wouldn't take any calls from me.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.780]   I was not available for myself.
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:53.500]   Why did you try to call yourself?
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.500]   It was accidental.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.060]   When you started up, there's these big pictures at the top.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.620]   And some of them are online and some are not.
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:03.700]   And it's kind of confusing as to why they specify those people as featured contacts,
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.180]   even when they're not online.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.180]   And the search is not great.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:09.700]   I was searching for somebody-- like I was searching for Marcus, and it showed me 100
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:13.060]   Marcus's, even though they weren't the ones I talked with the most.
[01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:16.500]   So I accidentally hit my own name as part of the Hangout setup, and it tried to call
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.500]   me.
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.780]   But that's a small growing pain.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.460]   Google will fix that out, fix that quickly.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.820]   But it's a phenomenal app.
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:28.260]   And hopefully, it's the beginning of a big arms race in terms of cross-platform communications
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.420]   amongst all the major players.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.420]   I agree with you.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:33.580]   It's only good for us to have the choices.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.660]   And I, of course, immediately installed it.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.260]   And I absolutely love it, too.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.820]   I mean, the good.
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:44.580]   What frustrates me about messaging is that I really kind of have to have one app for SMS,
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:50.820]   one app for IP-level chat, another app that works best for video.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:54.740]   And then an app like Path, which is for-- I don't even necessarily care if the person
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.340]   I'm saying this message to is available right now to see it.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:00.340]   I just want at some point them to see this really cool picture.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.300]   And man, it's one app that does absolutely everything.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:08.460]   If I get my entire circle of friends to switch to Hangouts as their usual group, hey, I'm
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:12.300]   going to be 10 minutes late, but I'm circling the parking lot over and appetizer without
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.900]   me app, it would be this one.
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.540]   I'm adding you right now.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:18.380]   It's actually-- it's funny because I know we'll use it with me.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:19.380]   I'll use it with you, Lee.
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.380]   All right, I'm going to add all you guys.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:23.980]   I already circled you, Andy, so I don't have to add you.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:24.980]   You go.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:25.980]   And I could put Renee in here.
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:29.980]   What I'll start-- what I'll do is I'll start a Hangout with the three of us.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:33.020]   And then that way, it could be an odd chat, too, right?
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.020]   Absolutely.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:35.020]   I mean, it's an all the time.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.020]   Are you?
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:45.100]   And because GTalk was my preferred messenger, and it still has limited XMPP support, so you
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.060]   can still use it with Trillion.
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:52.540]   And just like Renee was saying, that it will plug in with normal clients.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.700]   And I think Google's going to add more and more capabilities.
[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:56.980]   And we're going to see this in Messon.
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.300]   We use the Hangouts thing all the time.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.900]   We use it for scrums, for our tech team.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.860]   We use it for editorial meetings.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:06.620]   We use it, I want to hang out four or five times a day, and they just-- they work really
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:07.620]   well.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:09.460]   I think I haven't circled you.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.460]   I can't believe it, Renee.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:11.460]   I apologize.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:14.860]   I'm going to add you to my circles right now.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:18.060]   Until the Twitter Hangouts come out, this is going to be the best thing going.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.060]   Twitter Hangouts?
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.060]   No.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.060]   All right, I'm adding you now.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.060]   160 words.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.300]   160 spoken words leaving me right now.
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:29.420]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:33.580]   Much like Renee, my pick was something we discussed today, which was the-- which was
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.420]   the revitalized flicker.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.700]   Again, I recommend it to people all the time.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:42.420]   And I'm glad that actually it looks like it was made in the 2000s instead of 1998.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.700]   So instead, I'm going to recommend Stephen Sondheim's Finishing the Hat, which is not
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:51.380]   an ebook, but I didn't want to run upstairs to the TV room to grab the book.
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:55.100]   I don't know why, but I'm sort of on a Sondheim jag for the past two or three weeks, just
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:59.420]   like listening to every single one of his shows kind of in order.
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:04.860]   And yesterday, I finally got to Sweeney Todd, just listening to it from start to finish.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:10.740]   Unfortunately, in a public place, and because the lead role is a baritone, I don't want
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:16.140]   to go-- when he gets to the point where Sweeney is serenading his razors about how many people
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:19.660]   you're going to kill, you don't want to be in the middle of a coffee shop and distractively
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.300]   start singing along with it.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:24.580]   That way, you will definitely get a circle of emptiness around you.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:29.860]   Anyway, it's such a great book, even if you're not really terribly a fan of Sondheim or musical
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:35.300]   theater, because this is a creative person who's spent 30 years writing, writing, writing,
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:41.380]   and doing wonderful works, writing about the experience of writing each and every show
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:45.540]   and talking about each and every decision he made in here.
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.740]   The show company has a patter song in the middle of it.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.500]   I'm not getting married today.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:54.180]   That's just a total tongue twister for this poor actress to have to sing or to sing.
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:56.860]   When he talks, he breaks it down and says, "Here are the lyrics to it."
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:00.260]   If you notice, here's how I constructed this to make it singable.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:03.780]   If you just put random words in there, it's impossible to do, but if you actually balance
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.340]   out the syllables, you can actually do it in small chunks.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.980]   Also, you'll notice that in this song, she's really losing her mind.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:14.660]   That's why there's disconnected thoughts and none of her lines rhyme while she's doing
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:18.820]   the patter bit of it, because I didn't want her to have the sort of-- and you're like,
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:19.820]   "Wow!
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.580]   I knew you had to think when you're writing songs, but I didn't.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:23.580]   It's cool.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.580]   He really thought about all of this."
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:26.580]   That's cool.
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:31.140]   That's exactly what it is going through this book and saying, "Wow."
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:35.500]   And every chapter sort of prefaced with a few pages about here is where I was in my career
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:36.500]   at this point.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:37.860]   Here is how I learned how to do this.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:42.540]   Here's why I chose to write the lyrics for Gypsy, but not the music.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.540]   Oh, man.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.860]   Such a great, great, great, great stuff.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:48.140]   Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:50.060]   His face was pale in his eye was odd.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:54.700]   He shaved the faces of gentle men who were never that after were heard of again.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.700]   It's raw.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.700]   Oh, Sweeney Todd.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.700]   Have a little priest.
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.700]   Have a little priest.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:00.700]   I love that one, too.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:01.700]   It is a best soundtrack.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:02.700]   I want a proper bass.
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.700]   I want to get an old sunbathe.
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.300]   It was my dream.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.260]   I saw Len carry you do it on Broadway.
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.260]   It was my dream.
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:11.260]   Oh.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.260]   Yeah, he was very good.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:16.340]   It's my dream someday to play Sweeney Todd in some community theater production.
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:22.180]   I was just thinking about yesterday, either one of the Sweeney or the judge because I can't
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.180]   do it.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:24.260]   I got the mutton chops for the judge.
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.260]   You do.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:26.260]   You're perfect.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.260]   You're a two woman.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:28.260]   You're a two woman.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.940]   Sweeney Todd doesn't have to be able to sing.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.940]   That's the other part of it.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   He's doing it.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   It's good.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940]   I can do it.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.580]   You can Rex Harrison your way right through it.
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:36.580]   Exactly.
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.580]   Exactly.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.580]   I love Sonheim, too.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.860]   I'm going to check out that book.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:40.860]   That sounds great.
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.860]   Perfect book.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.300]   And we'll be doing the Petaluma Player's version of Sweeney Todd sometime in the fall.
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.220]   So make sure you stay tuned.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.060]   Anyone who knows sets and costumes and can run a light forward.
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.060]   We can do it right here.
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.460]   We'll have the VFW haul from 730 until 930.
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.460]   We'll be running.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.460]   Swing your eyes.
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.460]   Oh, sweetie.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.260]   If somebody has a barber chair, we can borrow it.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:03.660]   I promised a hose of that.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:04.660]   And a strap.
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.660]   What's more with feeling?
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.660]   It's great.
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:12.620]   Chet has an uncle who used to work in the barber in his chair.
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:15.340]   You got these straight razors.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:18.940]   This is a game that I credit Sarah Lane with addicting me to.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.020]   And I'm sad she did.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:23.300]   It is the hottest game right now, I think, on the iPhone.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.300]   You could play it on the iPad.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.860]   Actually, it works pretty well on the iPad, but it is an iPhone only.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:27.860]   A game.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:28.900]   Say it with me.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.300]   Dots.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.100]   Never before has a game so simple, been so fully addictive.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:37.420]   The idea is you connect the dots.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.740]   It's nice if you can make a square.
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:41.020]   You get a little extra on that.
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:44.460]   You get 60 seconds to connect all the dots in an array.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.060]   This is the training I'm just showing you the tutorial.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.140]   And as Charles Eames once said, eventually everything connects.
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:56.020]   It's really kind of bejeweled without all the cruft.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:58.180]   And it's really addictive and really fun.
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:02.660]   And I'm working hard because Jeff Needles, our intern, is really good at it.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:04.860]   And I'm trying to get as good as Jeff is.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.500]   I don't know how you get the things to coerce into squares.
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.900]   That's what I really want to know.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.220]   So the longer you connect, the better.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:12.700]   But a square is extra points.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.420]   You guys play this yet?
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:15.420]   Don't.
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:16.660]   I'm staying away from it.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:17.660]   Stay well.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.340]   Stay well away from it.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:24.060]   If there was anything that could get me out of the Simpsons tapped out, it would be
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.060]   this.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.220]   And it's 60 seconds to shot.
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.220]   That's it.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:28.500]   I mean, it's very straightforward.
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:32.540]   And so as a result, you know, it's what's your top score, Jeff?
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.100]   Is he around?
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.460]   What's your top score?
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.580]   He's like really good at this.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.580]   500.
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:41.380]   As you can see, I've got 57.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.260]   Josh has five 40.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.260]   Josh has five 40.
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.100]   He's the number one in the brick house, I think, right now.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.100]   Number one in the brick house.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   Wow.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.900]   Well, I can tell what you guys are working hard on.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.900]   No.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:54.900]   All right.
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.060]   So we got to beat Josh and needles.
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:37:59.540]   I got a dog.trophy.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.540]   You get trophy.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.540]   You don't want to.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:04.700]   It's in very much in the Lauren Bricters style of gaming.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.820]   It's very clean, very simple.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:07.820]   Isn't it beautiful?
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.980]   I just, it's just something so nice about it.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.460]   The typography.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.460]   It's so clean.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:18.380]   It is a really nice little mobile game and yeah, highly addictive.
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:21.020]   If I join up with Facebook, we'll see what the other guys scores are.
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:25.100]   I have it on my iPhone and my iPad mini.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:26.340]   I haven't played it on this one yet.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:29.060]   That's why we have a fresh start here.
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:30.540]   Dots.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.060]   And we're going to start a Dots league.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.060]   That's right.
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.700]   Is there, I don't think there's a lot of music on it actually.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.180]   I can't remember.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:38.180]   Is it very musical?
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.820]   I don't think so.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:40.820]   No.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:44.180]   It's really, it's not about the music.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:46.660]   It's about the experience.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:48.300]   It's about the experience.
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.660]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.660]   All right.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.660]   It's like that.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:54.660]   That's all.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.620]   Although that could get kind of addictive too, couldn't it?
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:59.260]   It's the Merwin game almost.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.260]   The Merwin game?
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:01.260]   Merwin.
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.260]   Oh, Merlin.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:04.260]   Leaves and bloops.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:10.660]   R2D2 only communicated in Beep some bloops and people thinking he's adorable.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:17.340]   Actually, now that I've got the music going, I think I'm going to be better.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:18.540]   I never knew there was music.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:19.540]   This is good.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.540]   I like it.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:21.540]   All right.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.940]   And two years later, that's why the alien invasion was such a success.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:26.940]   I'm sending us this technology.
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:27.940]   Call me ender.
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:31.260]   Our higher four higher brain functions.
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:33.820]   Thank you everybody for joining us on Mac break weekly.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:39.340]   Thank you to Chris Breen, the hair of Breen lives on on Twitter as does the body of Breen,
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.340]   but only one's official.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.380]   Yeah, the official is the body of Breen.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:44.380]   That's correct.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:47.660]   And you can read his Mac 911, com Macworld.com and a lot of his other writings.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:49.500]   He is the Mac Daddy.
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.860]   And we are at we love him.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860]   We love him.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.860]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:54.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:57.860]   Thank you also to Renee Richie of imore.com for joining us this week.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:58.860]   Good to have you.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860]   Thank you.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.860]   Leo, pleasure as always.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.860]   See you at WWDC.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.860]   Absolutely.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:05.100]   Andy and I go Chicago Sun times.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.900]   You're staying at home for the WWDC.
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.980]   Are you coming out here?
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:08.980]   I don't know yet.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:12.620]   I might come in just for a barnstorming little trip.
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:16.340]   I'm not going to buy my plane ticket until I know how many nights I can stay.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.700]   But we'll talk to the bursar.
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.860]   I definitely want to come in.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:22.140]   Talk to the bursar and see if we can cut you a check.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:23.940]   Always nice, but yeah.
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.980]   No, we get to benefit out of it.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:28.420]   I don't want you to think my going is conditional upon.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:32.860]   Even if I came in on my own patar, I certainly want to be there for nays.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:37.740]   If we can do our first all meat wear edition where everybody is actually around the table
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.740]   at once.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.740]   That's worth it.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.620]   That's worth the cost of Virgin Atlantic.
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:48.260]   I'm trying to coach for 81 hours.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:49.820]   Actually here they have coast to coast.
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:50.820]   Patar is now.
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.820]   So you'll be your set.
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:53.980]   And we've got party invite with your name on our nays.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:41:00.420]   For next year for next year 10 bucks you'll be in patar plus.
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.340]   All patar rides are nonstop.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.540]   So that's one of the upsides.
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.380]   And I mean up side.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.220]   Thank you, Andy Renee.
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.620]   Chris, Alex Lindsey and Abcensha.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.620]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.620]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:15.020]   Normally we're a little late today because of the Xbox and that's what normally do at
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:20.780]   11 AM Pacifica 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC on Tuesdays on twit.tv.
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:21.780]   Watch live.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:26.620]   We love it if you do, but we do make on demand audio inversions and video versions available
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:31.980]   after the fact of twit.tv/mbw.
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:37.060]   And wherever finer podcasts are aggregated stored and delivered to your portable player.
[01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.060]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:39.820]   But you better get back to work because you know what?
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:42.060]   Break time is over.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.580]   This is much longer than the federally mandated break time.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:51.580]   Thank you.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:54.160]   (upbeat music)
