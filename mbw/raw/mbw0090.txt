[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.360]   This is Mac Break Weekly, our 90th episode,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.760]   unless I've counted wrong, joining us
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.840]   from his aviary in Baston.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   Mr. Andy Enaco, the bird is back.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.080]   >> Hello bird lovers everywhere.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.720]   And to that one bastard who wanted me to kill every bird
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.360]   in the yard, what a black, black, coastal you have.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.920]   >> Hey.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.280]   >> I don't hate you, I pity you.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.880]   >> I --
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.480]   >> I would have said you a fruit basket
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.120]   to give you some little glimmer of open peace in your life
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.280]   because clearly you have none.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.920]   You see, join the world and you seek to crush it.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.520]   How unfortunate for you.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.720]   >> We got one email from a guy who said it's beautiful.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.160]   It's piercing in my car, it's piercing.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   But I think the bird moved off a little bit.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.080]   So I think he's actually going to be fine.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.920]   And we'll EQ him a little bit.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.280]   So if Andy's voice doesn't sound quite as bright as always.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.920]   >> Give him the whole American Idol
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.200]   for top three finalists treatment.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.520]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.320]   >> We can make this sound like something for God's sake.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.240]   We'll fix it somehow.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.120]   >> I want to -- it's a complete rat hole, but I just saw somewhere
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.720]   that Paula admitted that American Idol's kind of set up.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.440]   Tonight's the night.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.960]   Did you write the finale?
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   >> I don't know.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.320]   I saw part of it last night where I'm just thinking, you know,
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840]   I've met with five years of training.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.440]   Either one of these guys could be decent singers.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.560]   >> That's cold.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.280]   Alex Lindsey's laughing, laughing at these guys.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.240]   He's also in Boston.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   >> In the Boston area, where are you, Andy?
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.040]   Where exactly are you?
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.760]   >> You know where Dedham is?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   >> No.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.160]   >> Well, then you lost the best reference to where I am.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.240]   I'm in like South suburban Boston.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.760]   It's like about 20 minutes away.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.040]   If you know where Dedham is, I'm right next door to Dedham.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.200]   >> You know what's funny?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Dedham's where Paul Thorat, who does Windows Weekly, is.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   >> As a matter of fact, I've had lunch with him a couple times
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.640]   at Panera Bread.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.520]   Panera Bread turns out the chain of like bakery cafe restaurants
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.600]   turns out to be like the geek clubhouse because it has free Wi-Fi
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.920]   and soda fountains with free refills.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.680]   So just the other day, I got recognized at the Panera Bread
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.080]   by a fellow geek who came there to basically poach there
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.280]   all afternoon with Windows.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   Basically alternating trips between the fountain, the Wi-Fi
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.440]   table, and the bathroom for about eight or nine hours.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.960]   And so it's a good place if you're trying to get
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.440]   an opinion of something you know nothing about.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.480]   You'll find someone with the right stickers on their laptop
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.280]   that says, oh, I bet this person knows about the new Ubuntu.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.120]   >> I'll ask him.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.280]   >> Also here from San Francisco, Mr. Merlin, man.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.160]   Hey Merlin.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.480]   >> Hello Leo, how are you?
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.520]   >> I'm well, the little baby is so sweet and beautiful.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.280]   >> Oh, thank you.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.880]   She's starting to move a lot and that poses a challenge.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.920]   >> Is she walking or just crawling?
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.360]   >> Well, she does this kind of very enthusiastic rolling.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.800]   So strength plus curiosity makes it very interesting evening.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.320]   >> And have you decided, her name's Eleanor.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.400]   Have you decided Eleanor, Nori, Ellie?
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.440]   >> We've been calling her Smokey or Smokey.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.160]   Or now we want to give her an old timey name.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.040]   Like Smokey Knuckles.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.880]   >> Sparks.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.680]   Cookie.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   And also--
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   >> The one who keeps barfing milk on us
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.880]   doesn't fit on a Disney license.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   >> I think it's a Native American name though.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.680]   >> It does, yes.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   Stands with barf.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   >> You can find out what it means in the Massapoyet language.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.560]   I could help you out with that.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.160]   >> And how is Malachi doing?
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.480]   Is he rolling around vigorously?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.960]   >> He's not-- his big thing now is he's learned how to grab.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.840]   So he-- you have to be kind of careful of--
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   he nearly pulled-- Carlito was having a little wine,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.200]   and he's really figured out how to grab the wine glass.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.560]   >> Uh-oh.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.720]   >> And so he loves to grab anything that's within--
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.960]   >> I know who he takes after.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   >> That's a magsafe.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.040]   Did you get a lot of grabbing of the magsafe?
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.520]   >> He grabbed--
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.640]   >> I get a lot of grab power cords.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   >> Well, that's good now that you have the magsafe.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.240]   You're actually better off, aren't you?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.080]   >> Yeah, we were fortunate enough to--
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.040]   someone bought him one of these little bouncy chairs.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   It's like a little wire chair, so it bounces any time he moves.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.560]   And he's figured out how to use that to a point where he's
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   almost crawling with that thing.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.800]   And he starts hopping with it.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.760]   He's kicking his legs and doing his thing,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.800]   but that's about it right now.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.300]   >> So--
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.680]   >> We took him to the Legion of Honor to look at some good art,
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.000]   and he found that very fascinating.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   >> Excellent.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.680]   >> Excellent.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.920]   >> And he had-- any of it.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   It was close.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.480]   That's it.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.120]   Nothing like dropping, putting--
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.600]   taking a 15th century painting and having him throw up on it.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   You know?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.240]   >> Oh, yeah, you wouldn't want that.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.480]   You wouldn't want that.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.720]   Well, let's talk right now a little bit about some of the
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.400]   stories in the Mac world, because there are quite a few
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.240]   and some interesting stuff.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.880]   I thought a lot of stuff going right at Apple's market.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.640]   But let's start with the good news, which is that Apple is
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.080]   doing really, really well.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.960]   Some interesting stories in the news this week.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.760]   Let me look at the Apple.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.240]   This was from, I think, E-Week.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.640]   Now, I thought I bookmarked it.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.960]   Apple's sales, essentially.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.080]   Apple is doing so much better than Windows right now in
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.840]   sales.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   It's like 60%, 6% market share of computers over $1,000
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.760]   in the last quarter.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.680]   It's stunning.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.160]   This is from NPD.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.080]   I didn't bookmark it, unfortunately.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.320]   Let me get this for you.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   So I can give you the exact numbers.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:23.840]   Apple dominates $1,000 plus market with 66% share for
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.760]   brick and mortar sales.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.400]   Apple does very well in the laptops.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.480]   In fact, essentially, laptop sales for Windows are flat.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.640]   Apple's are up.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.200]   It's a very strong time right now for Mac and Tasha's.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.720]   Almost to the point where you start to think maybe Apple is
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.120]   starting to actually get some traction.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.680]   It's been 4% and 5% market share for a long time.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.480]   Market share, according to NPD, in retail notebooks for
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.040]   June 2007.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.480]   I guess it takes them that long to get that information.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.800]   17.6%.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.200]   What do you think it's going to be due for June 2008?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.760]   Did they mention the price point for laptops that are
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.600]   that they're figures based on?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.280]   They said anything over $1,000, but nothing Apple sells is
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.520]   under $1,000.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.640]   Yeah, and also, if you go into best buy, if you go into
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.120]   office max, it's hard to find a lot of Windows notebooks
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.400]   that sell for more than that.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.120]   The sweet spot for Windows Vista notebooks right now is
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.600]   about $700 to about $900.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.560]   Let's see here.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.840]   I don't doubt the numbers.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   It's just that that's one of those things I was trying to
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.120]   figure out when I first heard that report.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.080]   Because I've obviously, anytime you see a statistic like
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.880]   that, you want to rush into Times Square.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's heavily qualified, isn't it?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.200]   But they say if you include all PCs, it's 14%.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   If you include those of more than $1,000, it's 66%.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.600]   So clearly, there's a big market still for
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.360]   sub $1,000 PCs, right?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.880]   Yeah, that's pretty obvious.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.640]   I mean, it's such a dramatic spike that instantly you
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.320]   want to rewind back and figure out what happened around
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.360]   that time to get people to get either more confidence in
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.120]   the Mac or less confidence in Windows.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.720]   I haven't seen that measurement before, though.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   I haven't ever seen anyone say, people spending more than
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.040]   $1,000.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.560]   This is how much, have they put that number out before?
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.400]   I've never seen it before either, no.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.120]   I haven't measured it.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.320]   So we don't know whether it was really a spike or whether
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.800]   Apple was always doing relatively well in that area,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.440]   which would be--
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.760]   Well, they're doing well in general.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.320]   Notebook systems, 64% increase in units, 67% increase
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.680]   in revenues.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.360]   The fact that the revenues are up that much more
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   suggests perhaps that the MacBook Air is selling pretty
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.160]   well.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.720]   20% increase in notebook shipments overall for all the
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.080]   market.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.440]   So everybody's up, but Apple's up more than anybody else.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.560]   60% unit growth, 67% revenue growth.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.160]   This is on all systems.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.800]   So I would say their market share--
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.160]   Here's total market share from February 2007 to February
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.320]   2008 went from 9% to 14%.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.640]   I mean, that's significant.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.680]   That's significant.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.360]   I mean, that's a 50% growth.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.880]   Yeah, but again, I'm really enthusiastic about this.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.400]   This is really great news.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.880]   But it's kind of like, again, I keep
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.480]   coming with these similarities.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.400]   But anything that dramatic has a cause behind it.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.280]   Yeah, Vista.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.680]   Well, yeah, but are that many people dumping--
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.360]   Yeah, but I think that the people who--
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.960]   Vista's more translating into people who are--
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.320]   Vista's more translating into people who are holding off
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.120]   buying new PCs as opposed to jumping ship and going Mac.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.680]   Don't you think?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.960]   Well, but I think that the people who are buying--
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.080]   Ah, no, I think not.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.880]   I think that there's two things going on.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.240]   I'd really deal in both worlds here.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.400]   I think people are worried about security in Windows.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.360]   That's part of it.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.680]   And I think people have heard a lot of bad things about Vista.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.160]   And when they go to the store to buy a new computer,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.440]   they're not going to go to the trouble to get XP.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.080]   They're going to get a Mac.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.760]   Yeah, oh, no, I disagree with that.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.280]   I mean, again, they're going to the store
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.920]   because they don't want all the trouble of switching
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.040]   from Windows XP to Windows Vista.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.840]   But they're OK with having all the trouble of switching--
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.120]   making a Titanic switch and operating systems do something
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.480]   that's totally foreign.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.280]   You're also saying that they also have no problem.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.880]   In many cases, spending twice as much for a notebook
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.600]   as what they might have been willing to spend for Windows XP
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.240]   or even a Windows Vista.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.400]   But seriously, 1,200--
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.160]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.680]   One more thing, and then it's your $1,200 Mac book.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.480]   Compared to a $600 crap book from HP,
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.320]   I think people are starting to say it's worth--
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.160]   I need to spend that much more because they've
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.680]   had the experience of buying a $500, $600 computer.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.720]   And it is not a good experience.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.840]   Well, instead of comparing it to a $599 AMD processor,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.360]   compared to a $899 Core 2 Duo, I mean,
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.040]   you can get a very, very comparable piece of hardware
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.000]   on the Windows side to what Apple
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.520]   would charge $1,300 for on the MacBook side.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.640]   All right, Alex, your turn.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.840]   I think that there's a couple of things.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.440]   One is I think that the fact that you can run both Windows
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.920]   and Mac on the same machine makes a big difference
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.520]   because I think that now people don't have to choose.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.400]   They essentially, if they're going to get a new computer,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.520]   they can buy a computer where they've--
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.440]   if Windows keeps on going, the direction is going,
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.160]   well, I can just use a Mac, but I don't really
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.920]   have to learn how to use a Mac anytime soon.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.360]   I can still use all the stuff that I was using before.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.840]   Also, obviously, in this economy and every other economy,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.480]   you have the people who have money
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.800]   can make a choice more on how the experience is,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.720]   rather than the cost.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.520]   And so they are making a choice of that they
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   want to go that direction because they have the money to spend.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.080]   They're not buying the cheapest computer they can find.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   They're buying the one that they want.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640]   Merlin, you have a thought on this?
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.560]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.600]   I mean, there's that really interesting little short,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.320]   George Lake off book Don't Think of an Elephant,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.840]   where he does kind of an analysis of recent elections
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.480]   talking about how Democrats tend to lose these elections
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.920]   because they don't understand the whole concept of framing
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.880]   and that the Republicans have been really good about--
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.280]   anyway, this is not a political comment.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.640]   I think I might disagree with Alex because I think there's
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.200]   a frame and place here that is really substantial.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   And I'm realizing this more and more as I get out of the house
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.640]   than I talk to people.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.720]   I realize more and more how much inside of a bubble I am
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.320]   as a Mac user and how much--
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.120]   I don't know, Alex, I think that the decision making
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.920]   that you're describing happens on a certain level,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.240]   maybe for design type people.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.200]   I know that's a cliche.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.800]   But I think for most people, it's not even a question.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.840]   In the same way that it's not even a question for me,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.480]   whether I would use a Mac or Windows,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.360]   I think it would require a substantial breaking of the frame
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.000]   for a lot of people to stop using Windows.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.920]   Because Windows is a computer.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.840]   I mean, if I artistize my mom--
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.400]   I'm sure it happens.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.000]   I think part of this also is that there's just more room
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.400]   to grow for Apple.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.080]   But I think about the way my mom used to refer to the internet
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.880]   as her Netscape.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.720]   And that was her entire view into the online world
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.600]   was this one application that she used.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.400]   And I think for a lot of people, there's nothing there but Windows.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.240]   And I'm not saying this in a totally valued judgment-free way.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.320]   I mean, it's the same way that you think about something like--
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.360]   It's sort of a-- I hate to say it as devil you know,
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.440]   because it sounds like I'm trying to make a value judgment.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.200]   I just think that it's something that's so much--
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.960]   the kind of computer you use as Windows.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.240]   And it's-- I just don't think people want that kind of tumbled
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.880]   in their life.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   And they're much more comfortable staying
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.360]   with something that's familiar and under $1,000.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.600]   I just think for most people, that's--
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.240]   the Mac just seems weird to people.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.920]   The more people I go out and talk to,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.800]   Mac just seems so weird to so many people.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.640]   At the same time though, I mean, I'm telling you,
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.240]   I talk to people on the radio all the time.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.440]   I can't tell you how many, all of a sudden,
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.400]   how many switchers I'm hearing from.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.280]   Now partly, they know that I've been encouraging this for years.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.960]   I think you're seeing the-- it takes a little while
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.320]   for that train to leave the station.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.840]   But people are starting to get this security thing.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.720]   And they're starting to say, hi, do I really want to get Windows?
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.920]   I'm going to get a new computer.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.800]   Do I really want to have to deal with all this?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.760]   Plus, you add Vista and the negatives
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.120]   that I'm hearing about that.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.320]   I think people are saying I'm ready to make the switch.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.600]   In terms of disclosure, I should say,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.440]   I think this is cognitive backlash.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.520]   I think this is the fact that I have been so gogolite
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.760]   about Macs for so long.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.440]   And it's still the only computer I'd ever use.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.960]   I don't make any apology for that.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.720]   It's just more that as I get out and I go and speak
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.760]   to groups and stuff like that, it's apparent to me
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.200]   how incredibly deeply ingrained Windows
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.680]   is in the culture of business.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   And I think that that then becomes very normal.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.600]   And it becomes actually normative, if you like.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.760]   And I don't doubt what you're saying is true.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.320]   Because I think, yeah, but I think the way
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.080]   that's happening is one person at a time.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.240]   I think the ads help.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.040]   I got to tell you, the thing that makes a difference
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.160]   is when I have somebody hold the MacBook Air
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   or when I show them an application on the Mac
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.720]   or where they go, wow, that's like my iPod.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.240]   That's really cool.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.440]   I'm not sure it's happening on a mass Hollywood movie level.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.120]   I think it's happening.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.760]   There's also that halo effect from the iPod and the iPhone.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.120]   Yeah, I don't have to talk about it.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.640]   If you were looking for reasons for this,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.520]   you can check them off.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.920]   Again, I just think that the jump is too big
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.720]   not to have a much better reason than simply, oh,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.160]   well, Vista is tanking so people are jumping ship.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.440]   So what's the reason?
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.800]   I agree with Merlewind.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.320]   The problem is that there are two different hurdles
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.880]   you have to get someone to switch from Windows to Mac.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.640]   The second hurdle is getting them to appreciate
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.400]   that the Mac is actually a much better platform.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.480]   And that's actually easier than the first hurdle,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.880]   which is to get them to care that there's
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.400]   a difference in the first place.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.840]   And we've all been in a situation
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.720]   where we have this one expert in the family
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.000]   or in our circular friends who's an expert on bicycles
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.880]   or an expert on music or an expert on TVs.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.040]   And you think, oh, great, well, I need to buy a new bicycle.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.600]   I'll talk to my friend Josh and he'll tell me
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.000]   exactly which kind to get.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.120]   And they have so much information
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.440]   and they do want to put you in the best thing available
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.640]   for your price range, but they quickly cause you
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.120]   to retreat back into that, look, I want two wheels.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.240]   I want a handlebar, handlebars.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.160]   I want a bell on the handlebars.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.680]   That's it.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.520]   Thank you for your help.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.720]   I'm so confused at this point that I just don't care anymore.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.760]   Well, what all right, I'll add another data point to this.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.560]   iPod sales, which everybody has said are going to be flat now.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.920]   We've saturated the market, maybe even trending down.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.840]   In fact, they have been trending down.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.880]   According to, again, NPD and Piper Jaffrey,
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.000]   senior analyst, Gene Munster, extrapolating on April sales,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.560]   Piper has now increased its predictions for iPod shipments
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.040]   to as much as 10.5 to 11 million units by the end of June.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.440]   That's an increase of 1% quarter to quarter a turnaround
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   from what's been a 6% drop in the last couple of quarters.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.960]   So even iPod sales are going back up.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.200]   I mean, not by a lot, but 1% up versus 6% down
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.640]   as a big turnaround.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   And this is in what everybody's saying is a bad economy.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.560]   Right.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.640]   So what's going on?
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.000]   That could also be that kind of that lipstick phenomenon
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   that they talk about, you know, on a pig.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.240]   No, there's a term for this, but lipstick sales always go up
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.600]   at the beginning of a recession because it's something
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.600]   you can spend $10.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.840]   So I mean, I guess, you know, there's all these kinds of
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.800]   questions whenever I'm kind of like Andy, I think where when
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.280]   I hear data like this, there's like that's a fascinating
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.240]   outcome and there's all these slightly orthogonal views
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.760]   into that data I wish I had.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.960]   Like for how many people that they looked at,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.400]   is this a first laptop purchase?
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.920]   For how many of those people were more than five units bought?
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.840]   Because I think that's the really amazing ground war
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.760]   that Apple seems to be winning is the people who are buying
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.920]   one laptop at a time.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.760]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.160]   I mean, you look at it's almost like, hey, you know,
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.400]   for its sales are doing great as long as you account people
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.160]   who are buying it for rental car companies.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.280]   But I think that that's an important market because I think
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.480]   that when you look at businesses, businesses that are running
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.720]   Excel and Word, the computer they bought in 2002 is probably
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.040]   doing it just as good as it now as it did 2002.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.120]   If you're not interested in doing something that's going
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.880]   to push the computer a little harder, you know, you can
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.840]   last unless a virus is just, you know, tore the inside out
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.480]   of your computer.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.920]   You can last for a long time.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.280]   Can I say just one last really, really disheasing too?
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.720]   And this is just something-- I might have said this
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.040]   in a previous episode, but like I finally had this breakthrough,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.120]   at least in my own head, about the whole Windows and Mac thing.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.240]   And it's-- I think I've said this before, but it's just to me,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.360]   there's a critical difference here between what you're buying
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.520]   on, right?
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.800]   And it's like it's sort of like the bike guy you were talking
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.480]   about, Andy, where like, you know, if I need to get--
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.400]   I need a bike that gets me to the convenience store and back.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.600]   And like, maybe sometimes I'm going to leave it out in the rain
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.280]   or whatever.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   You know, you're not going to spend a lot of money on that.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.240]   But if you're somebody who goes, you know what, my ask can
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.440]   really feel the difference.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.400]   And shaving off those extra five ounces, you know what?
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.280]   And this is true.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.160]   It's very true with bikes.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   When you get a lighter bike, it starts getting crazy expensive.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.480]   Are you talking about shaving your ass?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.080]   Because if you are, I'm going to have to edit this out.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.960]   OK, listen.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.200]   I am going to start shaving my ass, and I do not want to get
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.240]   a lot of flack about it.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.320]   I like to be streamlined.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.400]   I feel like a comfortable seat, and I don't like a lot of friction.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.040]   Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is if you're--
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.440]   I mean, and this sounds so snotty, but you're
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.360]   used to this for me.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.800]   But like, when you're a Mac guy, you're
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.600]   willing to spend a little bit more for a certain kind of thing.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:11.880]   Right?
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.760]   For a long time, people thought Mac people were crazy.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.720]   Because they're spending all this nutty money on a computer
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.880]   that they could get the exact equivalent value out of for half
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.040]   the price with a PC.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.360]   But then the iPod came along, and the iPhone came along.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.280]   And you look at something that's a complete commodity product
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.000]   that nobody cares about anymore.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.160]   And suddenly, they found a way to add value to that
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.400]   by bringing design and build quality.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.880]   Right?
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.560]   I mean, people who look at an iPhone and go,
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.080]   the build quality, this thing is insane.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.760]   And anyway, I guess what I'm saying is, again, it's a framing
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:40.960]   thing.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.560]   It's a Lakoff framing thing, where if you don't see that,
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.880]   it's almost like if you're deaf, why would you buy stereo records?
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.160]   You can't tell the difference, or why would you pay more for stereo
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   records, put differently?
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.360]   So I'm just saying it's a completely different personality.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.920]   It's a completely different approach.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.440]   And it's really hard to compare.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.520]   And I think sometimes somebody goes, you know what?
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.320]   I'm starting to care a lot about the gadgets in my life.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.760]   I'm sorry this is turning into a speech.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.560]   But I think there is a point where there's an inflection point,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.720]   where people say, you know what?
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.200]   I do kind of care about this stuff.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.120]   And I do kind of like what this guy is doing with this computer
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.200]   that I feel like I can't do, or I'm not doing it in such a fun way.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.160]   And I think that happens.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.240]   I just-- I've become really skeptical about the whole switching
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   thing.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.440]   He weeks at Joe Wilcox, who writes the Apple Watch
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.520]   column, talked to NPD.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.560]   He talked to Stephen Baker, who is the Vice President of Industry Analysis.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.040]   And he says, any way you look at it, Baker says, I'm
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.720]   actually growing the Windows desktop ain't.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.480]   No matter how you look at it, Apple is outperforming Windows.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   He says that one of the reasons Apple's succeeding in these above $1,000
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.640]   market is if you don't give people a choice, people will spend more.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.280]   They're willing to spend more.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.160]   Apple appeals to the right segments, multiple computer
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.080]   households.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.120]   And this is what you were saying.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.640]   Computer consumers were buying a second, third, or even fourth computer.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.720]   Apple has better distribution because of all these successful Apple stores.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.880]   You just open one in Boston.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.960]   I want to get a report from you guys on that one.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.120]   And just open one in Vancouver.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.920]   He says, Apple's retail stores aren't just places to buy Mac products.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.960]   They're part of a larger end-to-end value chain.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.320]   And with it, the promise of a certain kind of experience.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.560]   What Apple drives home, this is a product we own from factory to finger,
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.880]   says Stephen Weeks, exert some control so you get the best experience.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.280]   People want that now.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.720]   And I think in a tough economy, maybe when people are spending money on something
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.480]   like this, this is maybe they're more cautious and critical about what they're
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.120]   buying.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.600]   They're not just running out and getting what's out there.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.200]   I think you actually kind of hit it on the head earlier on there.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.640]   When we focus on if we're talking about people who are out there
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.800]   with more than a thousand bucks in their pocket for a notebook,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:58.720]   they probably are aware that they can spend $700 to $800, $900 at Best Buy or Office Backs.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.640]   If they're in the market to spend $12 or $1300,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.800]   they're probably the sort of people who are looking for value added features
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.200]   or looking for the better build quality, who are looking for that car.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.720]   >> And currently, they're more of them now.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.680]   That's what I understand.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.120]   Where are they coming from?
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.840]   There's more of them and they spend their money.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.920]   >> Well, it's also just gadgets.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.640]   Gadgets are, I mean, like this sounds stupid and I haven't researched it.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   >> I think they're gadgets are lipstick.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.440]   >> I think you're right.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.920]   But also gadgets are getting better.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.280]   I look at the gadgets that I had a few years ago and like gadgets are getting sexier looking
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.160]   like across the board.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.920]   I look at the evolution of the MP3 players that I've owned since 1999 and it's
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.720]   mind-blowing.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   With the possible exception of, there was one blip where there was a Rio that I had,
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.400]   this is a Rio that I got in 1999 that was like mind-blowingly great and so ahead of its
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   time.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:53.800]   But not long after that, to buy the six gig creative, the creative weighed like six pounds.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.360]   The jukebox, you know?
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.600]   And now a couple years later, you come up with an iPod.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.880]   It's like, I think all of these gadgets are getting so much sexier and so much more of
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.760]   a design aesthetic is coming to this than was there even like 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   >> That's like Apple.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   >> That's raising it.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   So you're right, Leo.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.680]   I think it's raising expectations about like this is also, and like this maybe Dushi,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.880]   but like it's a lifestyle thing.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.800]   Like people want to be seen with certain kind of like high status items.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.720]   So I mean, I think that's starting to come into play.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.920]   >> Apple's a Cadillac.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.760]   It's the BMW.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.600]   Now there is now, and this is another, I think, measure of how well Apple's doing.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   There are now started people starting to take aim at it.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.560]   Napster just came out this week.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:37.200]   Six million DRM-free MP3 songs, 256 kilobits.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.360]   That's three times more than Apple can offer without copy protection.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.280]   It's probably more than Amazon's.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   Obviously the labels are saying, you know, go get them, Napster.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   Go get Apple.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   Take down iTunes.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.040]   I think they're going to get a lot of attention.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.480]   They have a very, now have you guys trying it?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.880]   Because they have supposedly a very nice user experience, but compared to say Amazon.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.760]   >> Doesn't like Safari, according to two seconds ago.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.320]   >> Yeah, we have, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:09.040]   >> I tried it on Firefox last night, and it's an example of what I call a web 1.9 storefront.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.000]   Where you can see exactly, say, oh, we know you're trying really hard there, but oh,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   so close.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   >> It's got a coat of light blue paint in Helvetica.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.760]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.800]   It's that used car where you say, oh, how nice, you painted the tires black and you raised
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.080]   the gas pedal a little bit to make me think the acceleration was better.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.240]   >> Do they make it kind of look like an application though?
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.160]   I mean, it's still in the browser.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   >> It's very framey.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   It's very boxy.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.800]   It's not remarkably easy to get at its features.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.240]   As a matter of fact, you would think that given that Napster is painting all of its, I think,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.840]   painting its future on this MP3 store, you have to kind of look on the front page for
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.080]   the button that takes you to the MP3 store as opposed to the button that takes you to
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.840]   the send us $10 a month forever and let you borrow some of our music store.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   I don't know.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.920]   I don't think it tries to be a middleman between Amazon's approach, which is not to be anywhere
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   near as flexible and nice as the iTunes desktop application, and yet making it easy to find
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.760]   and purchase the stuff that you want.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   >> And iTunes.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   >> And cheapers.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.400]   >> But Jam is on the cheaper and Napster is 99 cents.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.240]   >> It's not letting me even see what's in there without registering.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.040]   >> I hate to be that guy, but that's--
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   >> That stopped me.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   I went right there and I said, what?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.600]   I can't even see what they got?
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   >> Right.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.600]   >> Stop me?
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   >> That's not a good sign.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   When the salesman won't let you look at the merchandise, walk away.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.440]   I think that I've said this a thousand times on the show, but I really think that people
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.840]   or they get excited about that they have a whole bunch of songs, but they're being
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:41.480]   able to have a standalone application that manages everything for you is a big deal.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.000]   And I think that no one's going to get any kind of major--
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.920]   now, I mean, if Napster starts working with something like Adobe Air and builds something
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.120]   that is standalone, that is easy to use, that accesses all that stuff, that I don't
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.520]   have to go to the web page, I don't have to do all that stuff, I think that they could
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.320]   possibly get some traction, but they also have to have good players that easily integrate.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.680]   And it's that whole integration thing that Apple has so well locked down that I see this
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.520]   stuff and I'm like, yeah, that's great.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.960]   And I'm not-- it'll get a lot of press and people will say a lot of it and then a year
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.240]   from now it'll have six or seven percent of the market.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.440]   >> Well, I think it's not just Napster that's taking A-M and Apple now.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.000]   Did you see what Netflix is doing?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.480]   And this doesn't just take A-M and Apple.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.760]   This takes A-M and Blu-ray and everything else.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:30.280]   For 100 bucks now, Netflix went to Roku Labs, which makes the Roku player with a very good
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.680]   device, $100 you can get a Netflix movie player.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.160]   And I asked them to send me one and as soon as they're available, I'm going to give you
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   a review.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.640]   But this is an interesting product.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.760]   Connects to your broadband and suddenly instead of going to your computer, which I've complained
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.200]   about to watch your Netflix streaming movies, you can watch it on your TV.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.680]   >> Yeah, it's interesting though that you can't-- it's not really aimed at Apple TV because
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.160]   all that's delivering to your TV set is the movie.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.760]   You still have to make your selections via a computer.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.480]   You can't do it through the Roku?
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.280]   >> I have to double check this.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   I don't have mine yet.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.960]   I've talked to people who claim to have had to have it and they say that you use your
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.560]   desktop application to essentially set up your picks just like you set up your playlist.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.680]   Just like you said your list.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.440]   I don't know that for fact myself.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.600]   I thought that was surprising to me because it's-- it would greatly simplify the device
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.120]   in that the user interface would be simplified down to nothing.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.760]   Input would be have to be slim down, basically down to nothing.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.120]   It has no hard drives so you're always streaming.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.120]   >> Well, that's really what this is though, is an interface to the streaming movies on
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   Netflix.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   >> My only concern is that I--
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   >> I'd also like to see what the quality is.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.960]   >> Well, what I like to see is the quality because when I tested the Netflix streaming
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.680]   at my house, it looked like they took the movies and shaken and stirred them.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.440]   It was like I literally would have to--
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.680]   >> But you're a snob.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.200]   >> No, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.680]   My wife couldn't watch it either.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.240]   My wife was like I can't watch this.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   It's giving me a headache.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.320]   And now I'm sure that like I'm here with my cousin's house and he's got 20 megs up in
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   the house.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.080]   >> It may be a bandwidth thing, yeah, because I tried to watch it on Wi-Fi and it took
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   terrible.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   I'm sure it looks gorgeous.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.520]   It would look gorgeous here.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:25.000]   But at my house with a standard DSL, it's not super fast, not super slow.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.720]   I just don't-- I was unwatchable.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.400]   And so unless they fix that-- and I think that video streaming is really something I'm
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   not very excited about.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.000]   I know that the industry is very excited about it, but progressive download, even though it
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.200]   might make you wait just a little bit longer, means you get a better image.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.160]   And the streaming is all security.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.240]   It's all them trying to make sure that it doesn't sit on your computer for any longer
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.640]   than it has to, because you might steal it.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.400]   And that mentality is going to have to leave before we see any kind of real quality, in
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   my opinion.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.000]   >> I have to say, though, that-- I mean, this is the first shot, obviously, and it's
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   going to get better and better and better.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.080]   But the price point, it's nine bucks a month for Netflix.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.720]   The selection of movies is huge.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.400]   It was like 10,000 movies.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.000]   There is going to be a class of people.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   This is going to be very attractive, too.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.480]   But what I wonder is that, most of the people who would be in the market for this box don't
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.880]   they already have cable boxes and isn't delivery by a cable box of way, way more natural way
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.960]   to deliver this service than something I have to pay, not only have to pay 100 bucks for,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   but also pay 10 bucks a month just to have access to.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.920]   And also, I've just been looking up, there's a New York Times article that also says that
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.040]   you use-- you have to use a desktop or laptop to make your selections, but then you just
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.960]   simply-- you have a list available on the Roku box that you pick from.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.520]   So basically, there's a lot of money that have to put into this.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.760]   A lot of money that have to keep putting in month after month after month just to have
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.640]   the ability to see these movies.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.040]   So I think it remains to be seen whether this is the way that people want to consume that
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   kind of content.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:30:00.200]   Of course, if they ever got the Holy Grail, if they got deals in with Hulu.com, if it
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.760]   were possible for me to grab last week's episode of "House," and then the episode,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.760]   it was a two-parter.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.560]   So the episode that came before it, because I might have missed that one, that would be
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   a world beer.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.080]   I mean, being able to watch Hulu in an on-web interface would be nifty.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:22.120]   Well, I'm just very excited about the idea of there being more ways to get TV into my
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.960]   TV without a cable subscription.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.360]   That's kind of all I'm trying to do.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:33.760]   I wish they could incentivize the business development people to go and just cancel their
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.360]   cable for a couple months.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   I know this sounds like a typical internet guy thing, but like, and really you say to
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.680]   encourage them to say, "You know what?
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.960]   Just for fun, why don't you go see how a teenager gets their media from?"
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   Exactly.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   Here's why.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.680]   For one month, I want you to go out and for a couple of reasons.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.040]   I want you to understand a couple of different things.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.360]   I want you to understand, first of all, that I'm sitting around drinking wine, and I want
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.080]   to watch an episode of "The Black Adder" that's not available anywhere.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.720]   There's one place I can find that and I know where to get it.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.200]   And it takes me a couple of minutes.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.960]   So pretty much I can get anything I want, like whenever I want it.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.560]   Second of all, I want you to go and look at some of the applications that people use
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.840]   to find these things.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.640]   And I want you to see how quickly you can find incredibly well-organized information
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.560]   about all of this stuff in anything, a way that I want it.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.600]   I want you to see how there's portability from site to site and app to app about these
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.760]   protocols, that there's standards in place that make this very easy.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.840]   People all named things a certain way.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.080]   There's all kinds of stuff about this that's made it incredibly easy for people to get
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.680]   access to what they want in a very quick and organized way.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.600]   And watch how I can select multiple here.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.040]   And I can say, actually, no, I don't need that particular episode.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   Or you know what?
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.240]   I'd love to have all of this season except for this first one, which I already bought.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.800]   Anyway, you see where I'm going with this.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.680]   I think there's so, so much to learn from the way people are already behaving.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.320]   But rather than doing like, how do we, and I'm sorry to be a broken record with this,
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.280]   but rather than how do we just keep remaking the same boring mistake in exactly the same
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.000]   boring way, why don't we go and figure out how to take
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.920]   behaviors that are already incredibly well ingrained in people who don't owe you anything
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.080]   and then figure out how to monetize that.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.920]   Yeah, I mean, the birds, quote the birds.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.880]   The birds likes it.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.520]   I think that the garden, go ahead, Randy.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.240]   No, no, I was listening to the birds.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   I love the.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   They're much more.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.240]   They're not.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.520]   They're about as interesting to me as the future of streaming pay video on the internet,
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.160]   because I keep waiting for this thing to come.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.640]   And now I'm just basically resigned to the fact that at some point I will go to five
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.800]   friends houses within the within a two week period and I will see that the same boxes
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.960]   in three of them.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.520]   And then I'll know that it's actually here.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.040]   It's time for me to actually look at this stuff.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   Yeah, because we say I see it.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.080]   I can't, I wish I had the money back and all the gas that I've spent returning all these
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.280]   boxes that have been sent to me, you know, going to go into the FedEx and drop them off
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.720]   after I get my one month trial.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.320]   And then I'm initially sort of interested in it.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.800]   And then to me, the big thing about this, this Netflix box is, okay, nine and nine bucks,
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.920]   you're finally in the ballpark of something that people are reasonably willing to spend.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   Cheap.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.920]   It's simple.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   Right.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.040]   And it gives you 10,000 movies for now.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.840]   Is it an additional line bucks a month to your?
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.520]   No, it's your regular Netflix subscriptions.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.640]   If you're already a Netflix user, you're already paid for it, right?
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.760]   See, my question is how long is it going to take for you to blow through all of those
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.840]   10, all the movies in that 10,000 movies?
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   Because they're pretty jolly.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840]   Right.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.120]   So what Netflix is that they have everything that's ever been published on DVD.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.000]   You will never run out of stuff to watch on it.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.920]   Yeah, but you have to wait a lay mail it to you.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.160]   Oh, for God's sake.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   What are you doing with your life?
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.760]   You're so if you're that desperate to see the Simpsons movie.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.520]   It happened all the time.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   No, it happens all the time.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.040]   In fact, it happened the other night.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.400]   My wife had just read an article.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   She wanted to see Marnie, a Hitchcock movie.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.880]   I said, well, it might, you know, we could probably see, I didn't say we could probably
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   download it.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.920]   I said, which we might not be able to because it's an old movie.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.120]   It's not going to be on the torrents.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   That's for sure.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.080]   So I said, let's see if it's on Netflix.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.880]   It was now we didn't have that experience.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   You were talking about Alex because my because I was watching on wifi on.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.800]   I was trying to watch it on a Mac, which meant I had to use Windows emulation.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.400]   And so it wasn't a good experience.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.880]   It was very, it was too slow to watch.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.000]   But we ended up ordering it from Netflix.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.320]   However, had that had that quality been decent, had it been on my TV, I think we would have
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   watched that.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.520]   And I think we would be doing more of that.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.360]   I just, something's going to break any somewhere.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.480]   Somebody's going to come up with the right thing and it's going to take over.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.640]   I realized that, of course, just specifics on this specific device, they're not going
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.400]   to make DVDs available day in date with the day they ship on DVD.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.800]   We're asked, I can put in an order for the Batman sequel right now and hope that then
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.200]   hopefully they'll send it to me on the Tuesday at actually ships and then get it two days
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   later.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.680]   We're asked, I just have to wait for them to decide that they've already gotten as much
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.840]   money as they can out of the DVD version.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.440]   And I was ready to get revenue from streaming.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   Well, but in that situation, you're running.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.320]   We're waiting for someone to iPod this.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   We're waiting for somebody.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.840]   Yes, I turn that into a verb and yes, I expect to get eight cents every time that's used
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840]   now.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.240]   But the definition of the word to iPod something is to take an idea that's already been floating
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.960]   around this already been actually built sold to people and finally do it in a way that
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.280]   actually turns it into a viable successful product.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.400]   I think this might be it just because a price point in simplicity.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.960]   This might be the one.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:21.560]   And I think that Apple still if the media industries weren't so afraid of Apple, I think that Apple
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.560]   would still be the one to do this if they were going to create some kind of subscription
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   service or some kind of.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.960]   Well, they did.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.960]   They did Apple TV.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.520]   It was too expensive and too complicated.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.560]   Nobody bought it.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:37.360]   Well, but the iTunes movie store is selling lots of movies.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.160]   But what I'd love to do is pay my Netflix like subscription and have access to big collection
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.120]   of movies that Apple makes it work.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.760]   The Netflix read Hastings said, we didn't call it DVDs by mail.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.560]   We called it Netflix.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.360]   I think what he's saying is this is our long term strategy.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.600]   Yeah, and it may work.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.760]   I just think that it's going to be a long time before streaming actually is watchable.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.400]   You know, again, I want to see what this looks like.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.480]   If it looks as good as standard definition television, I get it kind of instantly.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.040]   If people start doing this, there's a model for it.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.360]   Netflix can prove, look, they're not pirating it.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.840]   I think they could make a good case.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   This is, you know, cinema now has been trying this, but they've missed that piece that gets
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   it to the TV.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   I think that's going to be key.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.760]   I mean, we're doing, I'm going to do what any sensible geek is.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.960]   I'm going to turn my Mac mini into a media center.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:40.120]   And that's, you know, I just got an Elgato ITV 250 and it's going to end up being, and
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.880]   I'm going to put that Xbox media center on it.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.480]   I'm just going to end up being a complete home entertainment unit that downloads stuff
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   as well.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.720]   In fact, I probably could watch Netflix streaming on it if I could just figure out how to do
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.800]   it on a Mac.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.040]   Yeah, I just think right now, I think that your live video out of, out of Twitch live looks
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.400]   better than the Netflix movies.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   Yeah, I should.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   God knows it should.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.600]   I mean, you know what I'm saying, the video quality.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.600]   No, it is.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   I agree with you.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   I agree with you.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   That's the problem.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   That's the problem though.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.240]   HD, I mean, you know, I think it's just a question of, is, are people, enough people
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.640]   going to have enough bandwidth soon enough to do this?
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.040]   I think you need to stream HD.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.400]   I think that if you can get up to a point where you're able to stream 960 by 540, which
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.040]   I guess is technically HD, I think that would be enough.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.600]   540p, that's HD.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.320]   That's, it's technically an HD codec.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.960]   I mean, it's technically not a standard app.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.600]   But really 720p is what we think of as an HD.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   720p or some people will say the real HD is 1080p.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   Right.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.560]   And 1080p is really enough to get a very good experience.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.440]   I'm happy with it.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.160]   Everything below about 40 inches or 40 inches.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.360]   You get a great experience with 960 by 540.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.240]   And so the thing is, is that if you can get to that point, streaming that, now you really
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.400]   have something that I think is, is pretty interesting.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.360]   I watch a lot of 480p on my 50 inch plasma and it looks fine.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.040]   I mean, most of the stuff I'm getting from the iTunes stores 480p, right?
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   Right.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.360]   Until, until you compare it to something, until you pop a Blu-ray in and look at it.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.840]   The Blu-ray looks a lot better, but you know what?
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.800]   When I'm watching the office, it's fine.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   It's fine.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   I don't need better than that.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.840]   And, and you know, not that I would do this, but when you download stuff, you know, from
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.720]   the internet, it's usually not 720p.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   They don't make those, they don't want those files to be that big.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.120]   It's usually, you know, 480p or maybe 540p.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.600]   And I think they all look pretty good.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.880]   It's usually not even that.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.160]   If you're looking at a DVD that's been ripped, what you're really looking at is something
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.720]   like 640 by 360.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   Right.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.520]   And it looks fine.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.320]   And that is the problem for DVD.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320]   That's the problem.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.240]   You know, that's the problem that Blu-ray has is that you're talking about people being
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:52.320]   able to upload videos or download them or whatever at 640 by 360 and a large portion
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.280]   of the population not caring.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:00.320]   Apple and CBS are being sued over Mighty Mouse.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.280]   I was wondering, but you know what?
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   It's funny.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   It's not Mighty Mouse.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   It's suing them.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   They're saying to save the day.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   It's not.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   You know what?
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   Huh?
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.080]   The original or the Ralph Bakshi version.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   Neither.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.120]   Did Ralph Bakshi do a Mighty Mouse?
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.960]   It's in Lysergic, Mighty Mouse in about 1987 that I watched every Saturday morning.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.160]   It was crazy and it was subversive and it was so much fun.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.520]   I knew I was too old.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.680]   Dang, I missed that.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   Did you see that?
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   Have you ever seen that Andy?
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   Did you watch it back in the day?
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:36.240]   Yeah, I didn't watch it back in the day because it's sort of fell into my band.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.000]   I was playing against Twin Peaks.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.840]   I'm like, you know, this guy is a genius or he's stoned out of his mind.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   Are you saying no sense?
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.440]   He made no sense at all.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.240]   As a matter of fact, there was a little problem.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   He was like that.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.600]   That's how he did for the cat.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.800]   But it was one of those really, really freaky, like ultra right wing uproars.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.680]   There was a scene in one of the cartoons where Mighty Mouse is in a bed of flowers
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.520]   and he sniffs the flowers and to animate that he's actually sniffing the flowers.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.760]   He's like white dots come from the flower into his nose and he starts acting all loopy.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.080]   Oh, gee, they're glorifying drug use and cocaine.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.880]   And of course, they all the left all they want.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.880]   Oh my God.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.880]   Look how desperate they are to pins.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.160]   Of course, three or four years later Ralph back.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.360]   He said, yeah, I actually, to be honest, I was thinking.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.240]   And Lucy in the sky with diamonds was absolutely bad.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.920]   So the company is a company called Man and Machine.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:39.400]   They are selling or sold in 2004 waterproof chemical resistant mice to labs and hospitals
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.600]   called the Mighty Mouse.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.440]   And then okay, there you go.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.440]   Good for that.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.640]   Now here's the interesting thing.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.360]   Apple licensed Mighty Mouse from CBS, which owns the rights to here.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.240]   I am to say today.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.040]   Apple thought, oh, all we have to do is get CBS to say yes.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.120]   Well, you know, we know who they really have to fear the mighty fine pudding and pie filling
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   company.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.960]   Here's the, this is boy.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.920]   This is where you get our cane.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.200]   Man and Machine says CBS didn't have the right to offer Apple to license because it's
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.400]   in a different category.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:18.720]   CBS's trademark is for a cartoon mouse and the Mighty Mouse is for a computer mouse.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.920]   And so this will be interesting to see what they're suing both CBS and Apple.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.200]   So it's really, I mean, it's really improper.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.720]   I mean, in some ways improper research or improper.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   Somebody screwed up.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.280]   CBS didn't give gave away rights that what they're arguing is CBS gave away rights that
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   they didn't have.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   And that's true.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.760]   When you look at a trademark, my trademark for LLC is in, you know, in media over the
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.440]   internet streaming media audio and video over the internet.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.600]   It's not a, you know, it doesn't mean if somebody wants to make a mouse named a twit that I
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.360]   could license them that name.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   Right.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.640]   It's a different category.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   I like the Mac.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:57.520]   World editorial about how crappy partner AT&T has been for Apple on the iPhone.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.400]   Philip Nichols says, or Michael says, you know, I was, I was the guy who said the iPhone will
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.520]   never happen because Apple would never give up so much control to any company.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.120]   And he said, all right, the iPhone happened, but I was right.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.080]   Apple's really, really AT&T has just not been a very good partner.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.320]   Now the latest thing is somehow those AT&T Wi Wi Fi hotspots that were supposed to be
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:24.840]   free for iPhone users at the Starbucks no longer are apparently AT&T changed its web
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.940]   page.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.200]   At one point saying it would be free or actually part of your iPhone calling plan in a few
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.680]   hours later, they took that out.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.280]   Computer world had pictures of both the offer and the non offer.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   Sounds like they got some crackerjack management.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   Whoops.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.800]   AT&T told the New York Times, a human error, man.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:52.200]   There was this flower and the white dots were coming out of it and I don't know what happened.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:58.080]   So AT&T did say that iPhone users will get access to hotspots, but they didn't say when
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.080]   or what it says.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.760]   You know, this is the kind of thing that would never happen at Apple.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.640]   The thing is, is that like for AT&T, I mean, I'm spending money with you already, you know,
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.240]   a fair bit of money, you know, with you all the time.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.280]   It would be kind of nice if my eyes was connected to the, to your Wi Fi.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.520]   Is that too much to ask? I got a year free hotspot, you know, T mobile, but buying an
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.680]   OLPC.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:24.600]   And I gave up, I gave up great reception with Verizon for unbelievable crap with AT&T.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.480]   And, and what I'd like in return is maybe just some free Wi Fi every once in a while.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   It'd be nice.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.200]   It'd be nice, you know, just even cheap Wi Fi.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.280]   Even give me a discount.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.240]   You know, I mean, that's, that's the issue.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   We were talking about.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.240]   Go ahead.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.440]   I was trying to feel like I must be like the biggest big shot of them all because I hear
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:45.960]   so many really just not just bad comments about AT&T, but just I want to get a whole
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.560]   big protein filled breakfast in.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.560]   So I have the energy to yell about AT&T.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.800]   They want the way that these people want to yell about AT&T.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.920]   But I've had great service and I'm starting to think maybe they know that I need and I'm
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.440]   the most powerful eight people in this universe.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.440]   You know, that they're going to say, you know what, maybe that's the reason I have to
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.440]   know that's right.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.440]   I got to take it.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.080]   I got to take responsibility for the lousy service and the lousy speed transmissions you
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.200]   guys are getting because 80% of the bandwidth capable of the iPhone is being diverted to
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.360]   my phone just to make sure that I can stream YouTube like in the car, moving at 80 miles
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.400]   an hour and still have perfect 30 frames per second video.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.080]   We were talking last week about how Apple might pull the plug on AT&T and as we see these
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:30.560]   deals they're making in Italy and in Australia and India where there is, it is a non-exclusive
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.280]   deal with these phone companies.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.480]   In fact, it looks like Apple doesn't have a single partner in most countries except the
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.680]   US.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   So it should be interesting to see if Apple finally pulls the plug on its lousy part.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.720]   I thought this was a great editorial from Philip.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   Let's see.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.640]   Another editorial I'm going to pass along to you about .Mac.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.800]   Want to know what you think this is from CNET News is Tom Crazit.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.160]   He says, "Apple is missing a golden .Mac opportunity."
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.440]   We've said this for a while, that .Mac just isn't what it ought to be.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.880]   I've actually got an Apple script that posts that article about once every six weeks writes
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.720]   it for me and changes the dates, changes the names.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   I'm on three.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.240]   I won three awards for it.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   I like .Mac.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.680]   Now that back to my Mac kind of works.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.600]   It's like loving your drunk dad.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   It is.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   Great all the time he's going to hit you.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   I'm a copac.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.280]   They're going to poke me in the eye with a much blunderstick.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.320]   They've listened to my emails.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.160]   Apparently it's selling pretty well.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.880]   So .Mac revenue, $529 million in three months.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.080]   So that's not so bad.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.840]   But it does seem like they could do more with that.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.720]   What would you guys do to make .Mac better?
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   Make it free.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   Or make it.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   Make it.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.960]   So that's why I said so low that people that Apple will just basically be charging for accounting
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.120]   purposes to make sure that they don't have to take a tax hit for the added feature value.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   Make it cheap.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.800]   And then if you want more storage, give them a gigabyte or give them two gigabytes.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.680]   If you want more storage, then they can make that up.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.480]   They do very well, I think.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.280]   I do think that having something that just comes with your computer or is $2 or $10 or
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.280]   something.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.160]   But it's a much smaller amount.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.400]   And then I actually use it a fair bit.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   And I do.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   I'd pay for it.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   I'd love it.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.400]   I pay for it.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   I pay for extra storage.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.040]   It's a solid place that I can just throw things really easily.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.200]   My iApps integrate with it well.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   That type of thing.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   I like being able to just hit a button and have iPhoto send everything to something that
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.680]   I have integrated with my iWeb.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:49.120]   And I'm one of those guys that I don't like to do web design or web building or web anything.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.740]   So being able to just kind of have it happen and get up there so that my family is happy
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.880]   and seeing pictures is a good thing.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:03.280]   Yeah I mean if they stop selling it as this bakers dozen of disconnected utilities and
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.400]   simply put it on the poster and say .Mac is the glue that connects every bit of your
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.240]   Macintosh and Windows experience together into one big sticky ball of rice and charge
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   no more than $50 a year for it.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.960]   And it becomes the way that everybody swaps files.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.560]   Becomes the way that everybody shares files not just between other people but between
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.720]   themselves and their home Macs.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.480]   I just I mean I'm with everybody else.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.120]   I just think that there's a huge pile of potential here that Apple is just leaving back on the
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120]   table.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:39.280]   Rumor time from in gadget word on the street they say we mean the internet.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.240]   Apple will begin exclusive use of BLU LEDs blue LED displays and all of its Macbooks come
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:50.440]   from 2009 according to the Chinese language paper economic daily news the computer makers
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.640]   Taiwanese supplier of LED backlight units Ken Moss will increase shipments in the coming
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:00.760]   year of the brighter longer lasting better dressed components.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.480]   I like LED screens I have to say that's that's to me the biggest selling point in the air
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:10.200]   is not the size it's that beautiful rock solid screen it makes me want to buy a new Macbook
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.200]   a pro I really like those screens and I'd love to are these did you know about these
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.080]   blue LEDs anybody or this is something different from what they're using.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.680]   I'm afraid I don't know.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:26.600]   I know my screen is really really bright it's like amazingly bright which what are you using
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.080]   on the Macbook air shut up.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.320]   Oh it's really bright Leo and it's really right you think it's not going to get brighter
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.400]   and then you make it brighter people say wow that screen is bright right.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.000]   I like I mean to me it's not so much the bright it looks like it's painted on.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.600]   Do you know what I mean it just really feels solid and I think that that's.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.600]   Hey B you should take that to a genius that sounds to me.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.720]   Well it makes sense because there's a little flicker in all in all fluorescence isn't there
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.160]   some there's some flicker but the LEDs they're just rock solid the colors.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.160]   Boom.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   Boom.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   I could be wrong.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.080]   We're going to take a break and come back with your picks.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:08.160]   Gentlemen I've got a physical pick I'm going to show the folks at home.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.960]   There's a Kleenex cot sex or no.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.760]   I took a second knuckle.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.760]   Okay.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   Stop when you reach resistance.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   First.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.520]   It's the word.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.280]   I'm sorry to continue.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.840]   You notice it makes me my hand goes to my nose.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.880]   First word from the folks at audible audible.com slash Mac break that's the place to go to sign
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.800]   up for audible if you're not already a member what the heck haven't you been listening don't
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.280]   you know how great audible is it's audio books.

[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   and that's to me what makes audible unique you know there are a variety of I used to
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.080]   listen on books on tape but some of them were just like the guy I don't know where they
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:54.080]   got him off the street I don't know he would maybe it was Ben Stein I don't know but it
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.920]   was just boring he would talk like this and now these books are so good they've got the
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:04.400]   best readers they've really perfected this so you're listening to a lively engaging story
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.320]   that really it makes you feel like you're part of it it is a completely different experience
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.840]   than reading and frankly I've come to prefer it thank goodness there's audible 45,000 plus
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:20.200]   titles in every possible category I have one to recommend unless do you have one Andy
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.440]   because you always have some good books and I like your recommendations I always yes I
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.560]   do have one this week something I believe I have been getting lots of emails about the
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:34.360]   book that I told people I was going to recommend this week oh that's right yes you feel about
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:39.040]   that we were going to talk about Richard Dawkins the God delusion yes I got some I got some
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.640]   emails about it that I have bought the the new updated edition of the God delusion on
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.200]   my Kindle I want to read read it from start to finish because it's been it's been like
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.440]   I read it when first come out in the hardcover enough people are our list are really looking
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.160]   forward to what I say about it that I really think I should take it a little bit more seriously
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.160]   than here's what I remember from a year and a half ago so I'm going to read it all over
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:04.160]   again from start to finish I'm on chapter four and I will talk so we'll talk about it next
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.920]   week so I'm going to give you I'm going to give the probably the subject we can all agree
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:17.320]   on a little religion called Star Wars possibly influenced by the success of the BBC radio
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.840]   workshop recording of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy National Public Radio commissioned
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:28.040]   a complete retelling of the Star Wars as a radio drama not an audiobook not you know
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:32.520]   just taking the soundtrack and re-editing it but a restaging it as an radio drama and
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.800]   Mark Hamill was in it right yeah Mark Hamill was in it Anthony Daniels was in it a C3PO
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.600]   yeah it was it was like a long recording session and then like weeks and weeks of audio editing
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:47.240]   to add the sound effects in lots of us who are of a certain age received this big brick
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.320]   at Christmas that we just have to do it our hands like oh my god this has got to be the
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:52:00.080]   Star Wars radio drama you're the most awesome uncle ever I did do that yes so so yeah so
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:05.000]   my pick is the star with the dramatized version of Star Wars apparently was written by George
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.080]   Lucas according to Audible that's enough keywords that you should be able to find it came out
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:13.320]   shortly after the movie I mean it was it was in the early ages it was a few years after
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.960]   the movie the movie I remember listening to it yeah like 88 one or so yeah eight years
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.640]   according to Audible's website it says it came out in 81 so this would have been coming
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:28.760]   out at the very tail end of the the the immortal trilogy Audible also says that it it causes
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.040]   40% jump in NPR listening ship I think that's how a lot of people I have an image
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:39.320]   show has nothing to do with gardening what the hell is this I have I have whatever the
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:44.800]   opposite of a distinction is of having the NPR coffee table book from the 1990s kidding
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.760]   and it was a turning point for NPR that was they brought in a huge number of people who
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:53.680]   weren't just you know hippies with you know Indian blankets they did a really good job
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.360]   though I mean this was well done yeah let me play a little I'll play a little bit of it
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.440]   I don't know whether this is in the middle of the beginning sometimes these ex groups they
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:08.360]   start too early we just play a little bit of it this is from the NPR dramatization yeah
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.280]   I think this is right at the beginning but you can see I mean they put a lot of work in
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:26.920]   there's music reading I could tell I could tell what don't bother me with small fry where's
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:33.240]   the juice I'm thirsty all right name that actor I could I recognize his voice even swim
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:37.360]   it's not like swimmer but it's not but it's another guy like that me beefy face I could
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:44.440]   all right I guess it's this is the kid who tormented Skywalker in the where's the party
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:51.480]   Star Wars hi I am Luke right yeah go back to lover hey boys guess what Skywalker was
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.920]   doing hey sitting in the tech dome playing an academy recruitment team this is not this
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:02.400]   is not your father's Star Wars yeah this is it's been a while since I saw the provenance
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:08.280]   on this particular title but yeah it goes it's like a lot of the books books based on movies
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.440]   you actually get access to earlier versions of the screenplay a lot of scenes that a lot
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.160]   of scenes that weren't in that were written but never filmed or cut earlier on have been
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.720]   restored it's a much bigger canvas a much bigger had fun they have six hours to do it
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:26.120]   instead to yeah exactly I mean I I'm the sort of guy who god knows if you made me a random
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.960]   line anywhere from the movie I can probably recite all the dialogue from that point onward
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.760]   and then start raming the credits all the way down to all the way down to the eighth guy
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:40.840]   who operated the the the gimbal pod on whatever and even even I find it interesting and engaging
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.720]   and again it's it's one of these great things you just leave it in the car and then you'll
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   when I'm spending extra 60 bucks on gas just because you're idling in the driveway because
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.080]   you want to hear you want to hear the rest of this that's just a good example of how audible
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:57.920]   really goes beyond just books I mean everything is on here a lot of radio drama a lot of dramatized
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:03.240]   books as well audible dot com slash Mac break our recommendation I think a very good one
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.600]   Star Wars the dramatization by George Lucas this would be a very good one by the way to
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.440]   use your credit on because it's it's a kind of little bit pricey so yeah I'm trying to
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.320]   I'm trying to find the really the ones that are really gonna make audible hurt I'm hoping
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:19.240]   I'm hoping that after a search if I keep up this campaign they'll eventually like limit
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:24.480]   it to no more than twenty five dollars and thirteen cents never never you know you don't
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.960]   really want to learn conversational Hebrew but this one costs hundred seventy three dollars
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.720]   and you just want audible to feel some pain over the prices are set by the publisher by
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.840]   the way not by all the way let me let me tell you go to audible dot com slash Mac break and
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.920]   you can listen to this and many many other wonderful titles it's going to change your
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.000]   experience your relationship to your commute to your workout to your gardening because suddenly
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.880]   you'll be you'll be transported to to tatoween among other places audible dot com slash Mac
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:57.600]   break we thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly in the entire to network
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:03.840]   we really really do thank you audible dot com okay now let's get to some pics what do
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.040]   you say I was gonna pick something that actually kind of went out of business.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:13.520]   First you guys think that about the screwy.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.800]   Get the tech TV that's the no I was really excited about this flickery thing you know
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:29.320]   flickeries oh it was a it was a really cool flicker client kind of that would allow you
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:35.560]   to kind of browse flicker and use flicker it was beautiful Mac client was really cool
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:43.840]   and just yesterday flicker suspended the guys API key and that's it okay so it's not
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.120]   it's not the great news is that the guy if for to pay the registration fee the guy does
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   accept flues.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:55.320]   So for beans maybe six beans when I remember those guys.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:02.080]   Flickery was just really nicely done I feel kind of bad that it seems I guess what happened
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:09.440]   probably is that flicker decided hey this is better than our stuff and so you better
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.000]   people aren't going to our website it's from a time I got a call you on that I think that's
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.080]   I don't think that's what happened thought no no flickers all of us.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:21.480]   What about the mashup they love that stuff I think if they're if it's killing their
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:26.240]   API and hurting performance I just I'm knowing the flicker folks I know that's really far
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.240]   far.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:31.720]   All right good I'm glad to hear it then so flicker help this guy out help him make it
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.480]   you know because I think it's a really it's nice to have this client it's it's a it's
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:43.880]   a eternal storms dot a T slash flickery FLICK he put the E back and flicker FLICK E bar
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.760]   why puts the E back and flicker that's what they don't like exactly the guy the guy the
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:55.200]   guy who created flicker his family was killed by a letter E one day no like no he's we're
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.360]   not allowing ease so I'm not going to make that my pick because it doesn't do anything
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.640]   but I do have something that I just got sent from doctor bought it's actually from the
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:08.000]   folks at blue who do really cool microphones and we've talked about the snowball before
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.880]   this is the snowflake and look at this it's it blew makes the prettiest microphones ever
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.280]   it's a great design isn't it yes have you seen it oh yes I don't have one yet but I've
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.800]   seen it it's just really it's clever it's a ball kind of like the snowball but it's
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.920]   got a table stand and then it swivels it's a USB mic so this would be a great choice for
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:31.200]   podcasters it'd be good for Skype for anything where and because it hasn't it comes in a
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.720]   nice little stand you can you know you can tilt it you can orient it you could even sit
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.800]   it on a laptop if you want and it's got the USB connector on it I just really think it's
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:46.040]   a they've done it once again they do the best design out there but anybody about it you
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:51.000]   feel like you're using like a really great high quality old timey broadcast microphone
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.400]   but then when it's time to like pack up and go you basically turn the ball when I'm
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.760]   donated degrees fall it folds flat into a receptacle that's shaped like the like the
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.840]   microphone and you basically now have this nice little compact slab of technology that
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:06.640]   fits right your bag perfect for your notebook I haven't used it yet and vouch for I can
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.400]   watch for how cool it looks I can't watch for how cool it actually looks right onto your
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:14.960]   I'll just show people who are watching at home you just look it right onto your laptop
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.120]   like that right onto the screen it is so pretty well I can tell you one thing I mean
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   blue is used blue mics are used by professional recording studios all the time and this is
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.080]   a very high quality mic company the snowball didn't have a lot of headroom it's one of
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.160]   the reasons we didn't recommend it wasn't very good that you know if you overdrove it
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:36.360]   I haven't tried this in the you know I'm an overdriven it but it but for for 60 bucks
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.680]   this is going to be every bit is good in fact probably better than anything you get in that
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:47.880]   price point so it's the blue snowflake microphone you see USB microphone and very cool I think
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:52.360]   the folks at Dr. Bot for setting it along to a Mac break weekly Dr. Bot has always been
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.660]   a great place to get Mac and touch stuff I just yeah look at it so cool so I'm recording
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:02.000]   this from the snowflake actually so this is I mean it's not going to be as good as the
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.920]   Pro mic I use the high all but this is what the snowflake sounds like in fact most of
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.160]   the time you're going to use it probably on your notebook computer this right here on
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.800]   the notebook and I'm so I'm sitting at the notebook looking at the screen and I've got
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.240]   the snowflake right next to the camera so that's pretty typical of what it's going to
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.300]   sound like that's that's that's my pick of the week Andy you got one for us I got one
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:28.360]   this is a this is a free utility that I've been sort of looking for for a number of years
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.640]   like I think I missed the boat on this by about a year but I was really thrilled to find
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:40.880]   it this is a screen saver called script saver all it does is it when whenever your machine
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.760]   goes into screen saver mode it will simply run an apple script that you specify and then
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.560]   when it went for whatever reason whenever your machine wakes up from sleep it will also
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.060]   run an apple script that you specify because there are all kinds of things you can do to
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.220]   say look I'm walking away from this computer I'm not using it right now please do something
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.780]   useful for me while I'm gone one of my thing as anybody who operates a podcast and does
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.380]   things via Skype you realize that the convict just like you know Catholic Mass is a convocation
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:12.860]   before you get started the convocation for any podcast that starts with Skype is oh damn
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:18.140]   you Skype damn your eyes burn burn burn I hate you Skype yes that's pretty much how
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:25.520]   every show here begins and for me one of the problems with Skype is that I might have
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.480]   two or three Macs going at any one time I might have left Skype going on one of them
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.200]   and so I'll be sitting sitting in front of my Mac book in the living room expecting to
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.400]   expecting a call for someone to Skype in for do a podcast but even though I've logged
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.720]   in on this machine about three minutes ago Skype still thinks I'm logged in by it three
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.000]   days ago on the one upstairs and so it directs all those incoming calls over there that
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.100]   happened as we missed out there was an anti-annocollus Mac break weekly exactly
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:56.660]   I'm like well this is this the meeting where they decided I'm fired this is correct or
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.980]   guy you were sitting there for an hour exactly and so so with script saver all I got it so
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.100]   I have the same screen saver so to speak running on every machine that I use Skype on which
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:11.000]   is when you go to sleep please quit Skype perfect to make sure that there that Skype never
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.480]   gets left running on a machine I'm not using and you don't get that you don't have to lose
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.620]   out on your screen saving because you can also set an option saying run the script and then
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.240]   kick in the screen saver of my choice you still get that cool red baron screen saver
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:28.820]   going on and it's good I mean I have another I actually had I've had to write apple scripts
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.960]   that do multiple things you can also have it fire automator automator actions if you
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.520]   want because it is apple script is apple script but I mean there are things that on
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.360]   one of my desktop Macs I have it tidy up the desktop because if I'm going to be leaving
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.040]   for if I'm going to leave you alone for 20 minutes please make my desktop look good by
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.560]   the time I get back I've got another one that says please run a backup don't wait for the
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.160]   regular morning backup if you got a half an hour of out of time on your hands please use
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   it to back up all the stuff I did this morning it's one of those things where you use it
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.080]   and again it's a resource that you'll then start exploiting whether you're an apple
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.160]   script programmer whether you just use automated actions it's something that you're really really
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.840]   going to use and it's free you can just go down to the guy the author has a WordPress
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:18.920]   blog so if you go to swan man SWANNAN.WordPress.com from there you'll be able to find the link
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:26.320]   for script saver cool and it's free and it is free free free I love apple script free
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:33.000]   as the birds you might say the birds I'm not going to kill despite you that was one guy
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.720]   just one just as I said we have dr. Gregory house listen to the podcast good good to hear
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.560]   from him I hope your life turns around but realize that you know belittling other people
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:47.360]   is not going to prove your own live sir mr. Alex Lindsey have you a pick for us I do I
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:53.880]   do in fact one I just I was shown this morning so I was at my cousin Brad's and he showed
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:00.640]   me this it's a it's a Java it's actually a Java app and and it is zero Alex's so it is
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:08.160]   called molecular workbench and it's a little geeky so this is at mw.concore.org/modeller
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.120]   and what you can do is essentially you can once you download it you it'll work on Mac
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.880]   or PC and once you double click on it you'll get this interface that is really designed
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.640]   for schools is designed for people who are who are learning about simulations you know
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.040]   molecular simulations and so you have you're essentially daughter would love this because
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.440]   she's doing a camera right now and there is a lot of super accurate simulations going
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:40.560]   on inside of it so it's not just a bunch of little animations it's actually a it's actually
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.320]   doing the work you know it's actually making the simulation and I and I just started playing
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.440]   with it this morning but it's just really slick when it comes to you know showing different
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:55.480]   whether it's water or air or how how all of this stuff works this is a great little application
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:00.600]   to to play with you know and it's just something you can kind of do to with there's lessons
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.040]   that are built into it so that you can you know there's actually things that you can
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:10.640]   walk through and it's everything from you know DNA structure to you know physics to
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.760]   you know some of the chemical you know these chemistry pieces but it's a very very interesting
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.000]   little little application so once again it's called molecular workbench and and when you
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.280]   go there you're going to see demo models and simulations and there's just an enormous I
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:28.480]   mean some of them are you know everything from fluid dynamics to rotating drum mix or
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:34.320]   electroscopes cyclotron in concerned pool I'm playing with it right now this is so cool
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.000]   and then the things that you're seeing in a lot of those some of them are animations
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.440]   and some of them are actual simulations and so there's a it's it is it's a really really
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:50.000]   great little application for kids to play with but you know I'm for me to it's uses
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.960]   science yes I'm gonna I'm gonna send a link right now to Abby because she's she's taking
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.720]   biochem now and it's loving it and I I know she just would love this to play with this
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.240]   it's really cool I think I think it's great when when I know that one of the reasons that
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.120]   I got so into science when I was when I was younger is my parents encouraged it you know
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.960]   and it was just like once they saw the flame was the flame had lit they just kept on throwing
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.720]   paper at it yep and I you know sucked up a lot of information you know I want to at a
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.440]   very young age so it was it was it's definitely finding this is a virtual paper that you could
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.000]   throw at the fire we're so proud of little Alex he's committing arson at a third grade
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.440]   level you know let me tell you you have no idea what would happen when I expose the sodium
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:40.280]   to the oxygen what does pyrophoric mean dad let's see what I can do it's good news we
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.960]   don't need to walk the dog anyway it's like it is more like son what are you doing with
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.600]   the potassium nitrate the charcoal and the sulfur you know playing with the science experiment
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.480]   Bob dad you haven't been I can use here did that make parts what would that do with
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.080]   that sounds like a fart combination it is it is I think that's as good as you can think
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.680]   what's gonna say on the show what no it's it's it's just makes black powder you know black
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.600]   powder you know we made in college it was really fun is a contact explosive which is
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.800]   not very difficult to make I was gonna do it with my kids and my wife talked me out of
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.000]   it but it but it doesn't it's not explosive when it's wet was liquid so you can use it
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.200]   and paint it on things and then as it dries it becomes explosive let me tell you if you
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.640]   paint that on the bottom of the little stoppers on the toilet seat that's what I'm thinking
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:31.720]   but it's really awesome or just when people walk on it you know are they anyway there's
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.200]   lot so it's what you so you try to say is listeners keep an eye on the twit YouTube channel
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:42.960]   they're gonna be some awesome videos very very soon yes senator or the bathroom is just
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.160]   out there to the left we do have a sixth camera input I'm trying to decide where to put that
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:57.080]   camera and you've just given me an idea Chuck Barry Cam that Barry man how are you today
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.760]   what's your pick on God I'm doing tremendously well I have a daughter that we photograph a
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.080]   lot and what there this is okay so first of all just in terms of throat clearing like this
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.280]   is not an app that I have used a lot it's an app that I'm fascinated by and it's a service
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.280]   that I'm fascinated by we take a lot of pictures of our daughter and we want to make books
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.480]   to give for our family there's all kinds of ways to do this flicker has a bunch of really
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.520]   great relationships with companies you know the same folks you make move cards you can
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.960]   make the I forget the name dazzle or schnazzle or something you can make books there is a
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.360]   thing I learned about from Kevin Kelly's cool tool site a long time ago a site called Blurb
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.040]   that I guess a lot of people know about yeah have you used it for I've never used it but
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.600]   I you know I've seen their books and their gorgeous books I've seen I mean like so I've
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.520]   seen at least photos of these and I've read enough accounts to go wow this is a pretty
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.840]   good high quality make it yourself book yes and the idea is you know there's all the services
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.400]   like Lulu and Blurb and so on I encourage you I would say go Google for cool tools Blurb
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.800]   for a nice review from Kevin Kelly the wonderful Kevin Kelly but you would use Lulu for more
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.880]   of a text heavy book and Blurb if it was a photo book apparently Blurb you get a pretty
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.760]   high quality and I haven't done this yet but it's a very good here's what I love and this
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.280]   is why it's my pick is I've been dealing around with an application if you use Blurb
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.800]   here's the neat part so a lot of these services or services that I've been familiar with you
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.520]   create a PDF that meets specs which is okay right you can go and lay something out in
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:28.080]   pages or you know whatever your in design what I what I'm really intrigued by is Blurb
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.200]   has an application and in this case it's an OS 10 application called book smart and book
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.240]   smart is an app that you download and it's got it's a really a pretty nice like Mac application
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:43.480]   it walks you through the process of saying I want to make a book of this size I want to
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.240]   make a book and at any point you can go in and go manual with this but the the wizards
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.160]   pretty good and they'll say like I want a book of this proportion and in my case I'll
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.120]   say I want to make a photo book and I didn't want to make a baby book that looked kind
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:59.200]   of cute I want to make a photo book and now do things for me pull in all of my all the
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.560]   germane photos from I I thought you do that by tag yeah yeah I looked for my case I went
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.840]   to Flickr and I said pull down all the photos that are tagged with my daughter's name and
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.680]   so it's all there and then you get a nice drag and drop interface it'll warn you if
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.400]   it's too resolution too low resolution for the size that you're making it's all drag
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.840]   and drop it walks you through the whole thing and then when you're done you uploaded it
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.600]   and it makes a book I haven't gotten to that part yet so I can't speak to that part but
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.320]   I'm I mean I guess this is a very general abstract suggestion that I'm intrigued by the
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.560]   making yourself books and I'm very intrigued by taking some of the design part out of idiot
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.120]   proofing it to a certain extent I would just say have a look at blurb and have a look at
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.160]   book smart and I'm going to be doing it soon I just thought it was kind of a neat mashup
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:48.080]   idea to like you do all this on your exp vista or Mac machine and then upload it and then
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   make a book for you it's a pretty neat idea our show notes guy Shash is telling me that
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.560]   there's an interview with the creator of book smart on IT conversations so you could
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.200]   hear that interview at IT conversations aside any of the other guys that have you made actual
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.560]   book I've never made a book you know they they have they've had a booth at Mac world
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.760]   every year for the last couple of years and I've always looked at the books there and
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.920]   they're just they're full bleed they're really well pre-produced it you know it's it's a
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.640]   step up from like the iPhoto book I want to do I mean this is just between you and me but
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.000]   I really finally at long last one to write a book and what I'm thinking about doing is
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.880]   and what I want to I want to have a finished book before I go and talk to a lot of publishers
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.480]   you've learned your lesson eh yeah totally I mean the publishers are all here yeah it's
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.600]   painful given back that advanced money you've heard oh it's not that life you should hear
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.760]   my podcast about this but um no but my thing is I want to go I want to basically put the
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.800]   book together and make a prototype of it and I'm very interested in taking something like
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.240]   this and having a book in hand that I say well here's the thing like you know you either
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:54.440]   love this or you don't this is my book you know my my wife and her she had three friends
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.360]   who did this and they've been selling them and pitching and selling it around and it's
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.120]   really a good way to do it she they haven't sold it yet because it's kind of a controversial
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:10.200]   subject that they wanted to do the book on they they they're making it's called dickware
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:21.040]   and they're making little clothes oh good job I bet you I'm at my mom's house I leave
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:25.440]   it there right now the Wi-Fi network at my mom's house filled with packets with this sort
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.840]   of film I don't sure if I'm not the way to prove it you just andy I just want to say
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.520]   anybody comes up to the Twitter cottage I'll show you the book it's the funniest thing
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.680]   you've ever seen in your life whether we want to see it or not or will you actually give
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.440]   us a choice I'll give you a choice I'm gonna ask you Leo is it portrait or landscape I mean
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.640]   can you really get the whole measure of the man it well you know I was encouraging him
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:51.360]   to to use real guys named Richard but they decided they wanted to use the simulated this
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:13:03.000]   guys can be huge dicks yeah you let that out right yeah y'all it so anyway we uh so anyway
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.800]   that would be at one twenty six but I know they did this and it really came out great
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.400]   but then they brought it around and nobody would give us like we're not gonna publish
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.960]   this are you crazy but it's the funniest thing you ever saw so I do think it's a good idea
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:22.240]   to prototype it I just warn you pictures of guys named Richard not a good idea I yeah
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.160]   like I say I mean I feel kind of dork you bring it up because I haven't done it yet I tend
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.000]   to not not recommend stuff that I've just learned about but we you know it you know this is
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.640]   gonna sound really stupid but it's really fun to use you bring in all your photos you drag
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.160]   this stuff in it's in some ways it's not that different and I apologize I don't remember
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.960]   the name of the service inside of iPhoto that you can do this with but it's not dissimilar
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.280]   from doing this in iPhoto but it's fun to use my wife and I sat there on the couch and
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.320]   if you're a dork like us and you're a recent parent it's fun just to look at those photos
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.920]   and I don't know I'm looking forward to but I will report back we're definitely gonna do
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.360]   this and buy it for all the relevant family members so I'll report back on the build quality
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.120]   yeah I you know I every time we go like when we went to Egypt when we go to France every
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.080]   time we do a trip I always say oh we're gonna make the book we're gonna make the book because
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   it seems like a better way than doing like a here's what's neat also Leo's you can this
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.760]   is I mean I haven't I'm almost tempted to do this is going and pick out my 50 favorite
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:18.640]   photos like all hits hits hits hits you can basically say go generate a book for me and
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.040]   just make it easy just do it like that and then it tweaking yeah it's a oh actually you
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.120]   know these are four photos of the same thing I should put these on one page so you know
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.160]   if you do come back from a trip you could just throw your stuff at this and have a minimal
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.520]   amount I mean with all respect to the book editors out there that make books great this
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.360]   is you know for an amateur this is kind of an evil and we're working on I mean I'm collecting
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.960]   every you know I shoot a crazy number of photos but I pick out some of the best ones and you
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.760]   know we're we're building a book every year we're gonna have like Malachi year one oh good
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.440]   great I such you know and then that'll be kind of our best it was my way of making sure
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.240]   that I never have to think about a Christmas present for a certain group of people for
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.960]   you know we're fixed ten years you know and yeah see it's too late now Mike my 16 year
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.360]   old 13 year old nobody wants to see pictures of them exactly just the authorities oh new
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.320]   piercing that's very interesting why thanks for thanks for screwing up the Christmas news
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:14.480]   whatever I think all right hey good good suggestion book smart and a blurb and if you go to blurb
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:18.320]   you can find book smart I think they will link right off the front page right that's right
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.080]   that's right and also just in general just because I love giving a shout out Kevin Kelly
