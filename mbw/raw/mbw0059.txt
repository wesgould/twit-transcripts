[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, episode 59.
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.800]   And the core group is back with us, except for Merlin Man,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.900]   who is currently a wall, but will show up, I'm sure, momentarily.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.700]   Scott Born is here, we've missed you, Scott.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.800]   Well, it's good to be back.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   I'm, you know, I listen to the show and I realize occasionally
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   I need to be gone so that you all have somebody to make fun of.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   >> We didn't make fun of you.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   Scott Born is with the ApplephoneShow.com and actually,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   I just thought you just didn't want to be here so I could go.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.800]   I unlock my iPhone, Nina, Nina, Nina.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.300]   Actually, I'm unlocking another one right now.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.300]   >> I am.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300]   >> Well, we talk about that today because I've got the
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.800]   interesting experiences to relate.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.300]   There's some big stories there.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300]   Andy Inako is also here from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.300]   and soon to be his new blog, but until then, the same old blog,
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300]   cwob.com.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300]   >> That's right.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   And this week, I've decided to have extra presents during the show.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   I'm going to not be talking more, but I'm going to be closer to the microphone.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300]   >> Are you using a big bottom?
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.300]   >> Wow, let me open a brand on the online document.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.300]   I've got eight lines ready to go, but I don't want to use just the first one to come to mind.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.300]   >> Scott Born knows what I'm talking about.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   >> Yes, I do, but I was just laughing because I was quite sure that Andy was going to make that response.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300]   >> I think I've decided to go with the Carlotta.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300]   Come on over here.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300]   Leo wants to do something.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.300]   Here, come on.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.300]   Here you go.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   >> Carlotta.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.300]   No, we're talking about the AFEX 230, which Scott turned me on to.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   And actually, I guess you mentioned it to the AFEX guys because they sent me one.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   >> And it's very nice.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   >> I'm not using it right now because I need to get better cables.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.300]   I get a lot of noise in my cheap cables, so I have to get some better cables.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300]   >> Probably the problem is that you probably are using the preamp twice.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300]   >> No, I know I'm not that dumb.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   Because I do have a mic preamp in the mixing board and you're supposed to get line into the mixing board.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300]   And I did figure that part out.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   But the cable I'm using is probably not.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.300]   It's not what you call an oxygen.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.300]   >> Are we about that cable and radio, sir?
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   >> Yeah, it's probably a 30-year-old radio check cable.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   So I'm going to go out and get some better cables because I don't have a lot of XLR to.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   Anyway, this is a nice -- boy, it's like an all-in-one compressor unit that you are a big fan of.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.300]   And I know why now.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   I like it.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   And one of the buttons -- the reason this comes up, one of the buttons is big bottom.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   But I'm not using my big bottom today.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   Alex Lindsey, are you using your big bottom?
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   >> No, I don't have -- you know, I'm not using a big bottom.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   >> Do you have a compressor on your mic, though?
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   >> No, I don't.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   >> Oh, you don't?
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.300]   I just sound like this all the time.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   >> You just have a rich, deep, maleflow still.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   >> No, I'm running through a little -- just a little M audio fast track.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   >> With the PR40.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   >> Yeah, I like my PR40.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   Although the AFEX people kind of mocked my PR40.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   >> Oh, I know.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.300]   >> They said -- >> I thought it was a really big deal when I went out and spent $12 on this
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   popper stopper springing for the -- and now boy, my butt is being smoked here.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300]   >> You could use Carlotta's nylons for that.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   I don't think it would have been to -- >> Yeah, I got to clean off my popper stopper.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300]   It's been stopping more than pops.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.300]   >> Let's say -- let's talk about the Mac, because that's really what this is all about, ladies
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.300]   and gentlemen.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300]   When I say the Mac, I don't mean the Mac.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.300]   I mean the iPhone.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300]   So, actually, there's a lot to say about the Mac.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   There's a lot to say in general.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   But let's start off with Apple's announcement that my iPhone is going to be a bridge.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   Any day now, we're looking for a new version of this.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   >> You're a nice thing, Leo.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.300]   >> I tell you, I'm hurt.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   Steve Jobs says, "I'm a cat and he's the mouse."
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300]   Or is he the cat and I'm the mouse?
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:37.300]   He says, "The cat and mouse game is this unlocking business, but they do warn people with unlocked
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   phones that you may have a brick in your pocket."
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   He says, "We have reason to believe."
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.300]   >> Like our engineers are working really hard on it right now.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.300]   >> Our contacts at Apple aren't very good, but it makes sense.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   We're speculating here.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   We're just playing for it.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   >> We think the next update to the iPhone will brick iPhones.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.300]   Apple said because this unlocking software just really screws up your phone.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.300]   >> Don't touch the gap with doing this to us on purpose.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   >> I was just going to speculate.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   What are the chances that this really is a concern?
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   They're saying, "Look, we know how the software works.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   It's not something that we would do to our own software and do to our own phones.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   We don't want to be responsible for thinking of everybody's third party needs every time we do an update."
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300]   That's a serious, serious problem.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   >> I also think that it is a good preemptive strike to avoid lots of people coming in saying,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   "My phone doesn't work after they had done it."
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   When it comes in and it's broken, they said, "Well, we did just tell you that we weren't going to handle the deal with it."
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   Rather than having the guys at the Genius Bar have to deal with, you know,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.300]   there's 10,000 people coming in and saying, "Well, my phone doesn't work anymore,
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.300]   and you should handle it."
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300]   Apple's preemptively saying, "We're not going to handle it."
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.300]   And I have to say, you start changing the firmware in anything.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.300]   And you're -- >> I don't think you're going to change in the firmware.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   I think you're using the standard firmware.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300]   What you're doing is you're reprogramming the modem.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300]   I don't think there's any reason why that would brick the phone.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.300]   Furthermore, it is legal -- fully legal to unlock your phone.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   Apple says -- they're not even claiming it's illegal, they're just saying it's violating your software license agreement.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   Of course, it's voids of warranty.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   We know that.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.300]   Apple is going to run into a pretty nasty PR storm if they brick people's phones, I think.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   Scott, what do you know about this?
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.300]   You know something I can tell.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   >> Well, several things to think of.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   First of all, according to Mr. Wu, we know who he is, the analyst that's constantly quoted when it comes to Apple.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   He lives, breathes, drinks, Apple.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   About 2% of the people are going to try this.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.300]   I don't think we'll see a firestorm out of 2% of the people if they end up with brick phones.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.300]   98% will go yawn.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.300]   We didn't brick our phone.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.300]   Who cares?
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.300]   But realistically, you got a brand new Corvette, let's say.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.300]   And you decide, for whatever reason, that you think that new engine in the Ford Tour looks really good.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.300]   So you decide to swap it out and put it in the Corvette.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.300]   Do you now have a right to demand that Chevy service the Ford engine?
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   >> No, I don't think this is anything like that, though.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   >> But I think it is getting closer to something like if you decided you wanted to beef out the carburetor or do something to it.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.300]   >> I don't think anybody would, you know, look, you're clearly violating your warranty.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.300]   And we've heard anecdotal stories of people going into the Apple store with the unlocked iPhone asking for service being turned away.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   I don't blame Apple for doing that.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.300]   I mean, that's of course, I mean, that's fine.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   But I have to say that if Apple,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.300]   this will be interesting.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   I think if the phones get brick, let's define terms, by the way.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.300]   Brick means you can't recover it.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.300]   It can't be restored.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   It is, you might as well throw it away or bring it to Apple and shamefully say, please, please.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.300]   >> I don't know what happened.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   >> Yeah, put it on Craigslist described as lightly used.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.300]   I just prefer a Windows mobile device.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.300]   >> Not as it is no warranty.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.300]   >> No warranty.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:04.300]   >> Now, I could see how it would make it, you know, that an update would make it stop working or have the unlock stop working or whatever, but a restore should bring it back to the unknown state.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.300]   And the unlock doesn't work anymore.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.300]   That to me, okay, fine.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:16.300]   To brick the phone, I think would require, in my opinion, non-expert as it might be, active intervention on the part of Apple.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.300]   They'd have to want to brick the phone.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   I think that where it could come up is if Apple's reacting to people unlocking their phones by changing the firmware in the phone so that future buyers can't unlock their phone to protect their contract with AT&T, they could run the risk of bricking your phone.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.300]   So if they're changing it, they may be adding security.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.300]   >> But doesn't it restore, if I go to iTunes and do a restore, doesn't it just replace the firmware?
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   >> No.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.300]   >> It does not.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   >> It just responded.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   >> Go ahead, Andy.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   >> Go ahead, Andy.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.300]   >> So just saying it just restores the operating system, the files that were loaded on the device, not the firmware.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:09:04.300]   As a matter of fact, if you're worried about modifying the operating system and putting your own software on it, there is, there are ways to back up that and then restore it through iTunes, not having to reset the entire phone.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   But when you're talking about sim unlocking, you're talking about some deep mojo.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   >> Yeah, and you have to do some deep mojo to track back Leo.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   It's not as simple as you may be.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   >> I disagree.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   I mean, I know exactly what I did unlock it.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   It's copying a few files on there, which is copied off.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   >> Just go to Erica Sidine's post on --
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   >> I trust her.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.300]   >> So whatever she says, I would believe.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.300]   >> Okay.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.300]   So you don't trust me, but you can trust her, because she says what I just told you.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   >> Which is?
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   >> There's like a 12 steps you got to do.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   It's not as easy as you make it sound.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.300]   >> To do what?
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   >> To restore the phone.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   You have to go through a bunch of mojo backtracking to make that work.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.300]   It's a fairly complex thing.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.300]   And I don't think that it is no small feat.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.300]   And I don't think -- I personally don't -- Apple came out today in clarification and yesterday
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   saying they don't intend to brick phones.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   But why would they spend man hours and engineering money and everything else to try to protect
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   people who unlock their phone?
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   It's like it just seems to me silly.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   >> No, they don't need to protect them.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.300]   >> Yeah, they're going to do what they need to do to advance the phone.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   It's logically going to break what happens.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.300]   I don't know that we'll actually see bricks in terms of you can never restore it.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   But what I think people are missing is we aren't -- you know, some of the people I'm
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   hearing talk about, they're not talking about bricks by design.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.300]   They're talking about, well, brick just because people can't figure out how to bring them back.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.300]   >> That's different.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   And by the way, Merlin Mann is joining us right now.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.300]   >> Are you been Merlin?
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   >> Hello.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   >> A statement did come out today from the iPhone dev team.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   They say that according to their download numbers, they believe several hundred thousand people
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   have been using their phones.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   It's about what you said, a percent or two of the total.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.300]   No, that's actually more, isn't it?
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.300]   That would be set more than like 10% of the total or more.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.300]   The number grows every day.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   I'm reading from the statement.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.300]   The removal of the lock above was a major step forward in the iPhone development.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   I don't know what -- they obviously don't speak English as a native language.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   It made the phone free and useful to anyone, not only to those in certain countries.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   Apple now announces that the next firmware update expected later in this week will
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   possibly break the handset of all of us free users in the world.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:16.300]   It speaks of "damage" and "done to the firmware" and "unauthorized access" to our own property.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   The removal of these firmware problems, which were built in favor for AT&T, does not cause
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   damage as they want to make us believe.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.300]   We will provide you with a tool in the next week which will be able to recover your NCK
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.300]   counter and sex zones and even enables you to restore your phone to a factory-like state.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.300]   In the meantime, we advise you -- and I think this is very good advice, which I plan to take
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   not to update your free iPhone with the upcoming firmware, wait for the next version to be fixed
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   to work properly with your carrier and not break your phone.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.300]   If I'm understanding the language there, it says we're going to be able to fix this
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.300]   hang in there, but don't update yet.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   What a bunch of bastards, mind-grubbing, anti-user idiots.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   Who's that?
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300]   Am I right?
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   Internet loonies?
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   Come on.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Let's message the board about this.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   No, this is --
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   A number of downloads, Leo, does not necessarily correspond to a number of -- I downloaded it
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   several times, so I think that's probably the case.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.300]   But who knows?
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.300]   No one knows.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   Can't you try this on your little Oliver Twist phone to find out if it works?
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.300]   I've already done it twice now.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.300]   I'm actually in the middle of doing it right now to a brand new iPhone.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.300]   It's a small factory there.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   You just unlock your phone.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.300]   Well, I have a -- never mind.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.300]   I don't want to get too deep into it.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   It's completely legal, by the way.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.300]   I don't know why I feel so paranoid about it.
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.300]   Apple's done a good job making us a little paranoid, haven't they?
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.380]   I just want to know.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.540]   What lawyers have come out and said it's completely legal?
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.300]   What lawyers have state their reputation?
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   A lot of lawyers, and by the way, the copyright -- why are you so -- I don't understand, Scott.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.900]   I don't understand why you're so defensive of this.
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.420]   It is the copyright board that said it's legal.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420]   It's legal.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.180]   It's an exemption in the DMCA to unlock your phone.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.980]   What is so bad about that?
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.980]   A doesn't mean squat, necessarily.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.980]   Well, they're DMC.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.980]   It's not controlling here according to three different lawyers.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.980]   I don't understand, Scott.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.980]   I bought this phone.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   It's my phone.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.980]   Anything I choose to do with it is legal.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.980]   What is not legal -- I mean, what I understand is I may void my warranty.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.980]   Apple may look at the phone and go, "Ha!
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.980]   Pasha!"
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.980]   But I own the phone, Scott.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.980]   Why do you want -- I don't understand why you're so upset about people modifying something they own.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   A, I'm not modifying.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.980]   I'm not upset at all.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.980]   B, we're modifying a phone at the Apple Phone Show.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.740]   C, I'm simply saying that for people to just blanketly say something is legal without legal
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.100]   advice is dangerous.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.540]   And D, I've spoken to three different lawyers that say, "Looking carefully at the user agreement,
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.180]   that there is significant potential for civil damage against those phones."
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.180]   Apple, come and get me.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.180]   I'm Leo Leport.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.940]   You know where to find me, Box 1018, Petaluma, California 94942.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.940]   I've got two unlocked phones in my possession.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.940]   Come arrest me.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   The bottom line is to sue me.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.940]   I think it'd be if you would.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.940]   You know, either Apple or AT&T are going to go after anybody, whether it's legal or not.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:56.940]   I hope they do.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.940]   I'd love to see that happen.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.940]   Yeah, I know.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.940]   I'd be like, "Hey, Leport."
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.940]   He's Louise.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:08.940]   Well, I'm going to have to do two terms concurrently because of your Oliver Twist phone.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   Your busted ass nobody cares.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.940]   We saw me through John Draper.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   We saw him in executive terms.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.940]   These are -- look, it's our property.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.660]   It's our right to do anything we want with it.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.540]   It's Apple's right to say, "I'm not going to support it.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.740]   I don't blame them for that.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.100]   I would blame them if they intentionally brick them."
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.580]   That'll be an interesting question.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.420]   My guess is I think that they're probably closing loops that people are using to unlock
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.980]   them in that -- sorry?
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.980]   I bet they're doing that.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.980]   You bet.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.420]   So the problem is that in the process of closing those loops in the firmware, they may have
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.620]   found out that it bricks the phone that people already have.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   I think it's fun.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.620]   I think it's fun for Apple.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.620]   I think it's fun.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.340]   I think they want to discourage people from doing it.
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.340]   We'll see.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.340]   But I think that they're just --
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.740]   They probably have the contractual obligation to do that with them.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   They may well, yeah.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.740]   I agree.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.140]   I think that's no good to deal with the devil.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   That's what happens.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.740]   Yeah, I think AT&T, if I'm AT&T, I'm certainly going to demand that they try.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   You bet.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.460]   And we saw the same kinds of deals with the record companies and Apple admitted to them
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.460]   in the past.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   Well, I'm sure AT&T is demanding it.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.300]   Well, Apple makes it -- and it's not just the AT&T.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.500]   I mean, Apple makes a lot of money.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.060]   I mean, Apple's getting some percentage of our subscription.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.060]   Right.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.060]   Not mine.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.060]   Not yours.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:20.420]   Yeah, I think the AT&T contract from all the information I've received requires them
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.940]   to try to defend against this sort of thing.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.100]   And it makes sense.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   And it's good business.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   And if I were an Apple stockholder, which I'm not, I would demand it of them.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.020]   My question is, does this include also unlocking your phone so that you can run third party
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.020]   apps?
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.020]   You know, does that --
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.300]   And that's -- and remember, Jaws said, "We don't mind that so much.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.460]   It's the unlocking we're not crazy about."
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.780]   That's the data point that really colors how I interpret this statement from Jobs about
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.100]   some unlocking.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:54.340]   But when asked point blank about doing something that can't possibly damage the phone itself,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.700]   but is inconvenient for Apple, Apple's -- one way or another, their response was, "Sure,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.700]   go ahead and do it.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   I mean, you can always restore it later."
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.020]   You know, this is an issue that if you damage your phone, we can probably fix it for you
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.100]   at the Apple store in a larger context.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.660]   It's when people are starting to do something that will cause a problem for support.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:17.780]   They'll cause it to stop working and give the Genius Bar and Apple Service a huge amount
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   of problem in trying to restore this dead body back to life.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.380]   That's when they start issuing warnings saying, "Look, we're not going to promise you that
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.620]   your device is going to work again."
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.260]   Now, I'm certain that there's a certain benefit to Apple and that there's going to be a certain
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.780]   amount of collateral fear and certainty and doubt.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.980]   But when I look at the whole picture of the announcements they've made about people doing
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:41.460]   things with their iPhones that are not in the commercials, they're consistently defending
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.420]   the users and trying to stop them from doing things that are going to make them unhappy
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.620]   in the long run, but allowing them to do things that won't merely inconvenience them in the
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.620]   short term.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.980]   By the way, it's probably less AT&T and more T-Mobile O2 and Orange, the European carriers
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.140]   who agreed to do the iPhone.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.380]   They're the ones who have the most to lose here, I would say.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.380]   Anyway, there's certainly a lot of pressure on Apple to do it.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.580]   You're right, Apple's probably just trying to protect us.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.380]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.020]   Excuse me, I need another classic Kool-Aid here.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.340]   I will say, and I don't mean to be so much as it is.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.860]   I don't want to sound too much in defense of all this stuff because I think it's great
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.060]   to unlock it and I think especially if you're in some other country I think it makes a lot
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.780]   of sense in many ways.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.700]   I think as someone who, we make a lot of deals with a lot of software companies for
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:36.860]   the Pixelcore to get free software or to get long seats for our members.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.860]   It takes a lot of me making lots of agreements with lots of software companies.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.380]   We won't do this and we will do this and this is how we're going to do it.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.060]   It is a good deal for our members.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.440]   The issue that I have though is that I get into the same kind of things where members
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.900]   can't step outside the lines because I made agreements with a lot of people about what
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.580]   needs to happen and how it needs to happen and so on and so forth.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.020]   And ours are much more restrictive than what Apple's doing.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.460]   But the point is that I can see this situation where you have a relationship, whether you
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.260]   made a deal with the devil or not, I think that it were probably better off at least
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.700]   at the beginning of this to have Apple only have one, I wish it wasn't AT&T but only having
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:25.380]   one service because trying to get the compatibility to work with everybody might have been complicated.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.900]   But the issue is that you do have to maintain that relationship.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.460]   I mean iTunes wouldn't have gotten to where it was if it didn't have DRM.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:37.020]   Now we want to get rid of DRM now but it needed to have something figured out and that needed
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:42.900]   to be aggressively protected or Apple couldn't make the agreement to get it off the ground.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.900]   I think that was the key point.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.380]   It's a Saturn rocket that got the vehicle to the moon.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.340]   Now that we're there we can get us in it.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.620]   Yeah, I mean five years from now Apple and Google will make their own cell phone thing
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.860]   and drive all these guys into the ground.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.380]   So they just need to get off the ground first.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.780]   And Apple had to do anything they asked for the first two or three years and now they're
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.900]   trying to just keep out of whatever Steve wants to do.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.300]   I think that I think this whole thing is very interesting and I just want to point out we
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.980]   had a phone, the test phone at the Apple phone show that got dropped by one of our staff.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.860]   I won't say her initials but it's Leon Allehuah.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:25.340]   And the phone was damaged so we said okay that'll be our play phone and we've been like
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:30.340]   three days trying to unlock it and we keep running into problems.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.740]   Everyone keeps saying it so easy.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.140]   We've had several different issues with it but I do think we'll get it unlocked.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.660]   I know we can.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.180]   Shubi's been trying to help us.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.740]   We have been able to get like the games and stuff on it but we haven't been able to actually
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.900]   get it to work with the T-Mobile Sim.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.940]   You need to send it to Leo.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.580]   Leo's got this thing down path.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.180]   Actually Shubi says he can do it now in 18 minutes.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.220]   So he's got a pretty good track record.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.180]   But all of this stuff all of this software is pretty you know flaky.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.020]   I mean it's not exactly.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   Although this new independence which is the GUI version and the one I'm using right
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.780]   now does a pretty good job and makes it pretty straightforward.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.260]   It's three button pushes.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.380]   Well Leon is pretty smart about this stuff and she's been having trouble.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.900]   I mean she's like a wizard at this stuff and I've been watching her do it.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.900]   It is difficult.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.900]   Yes not at all.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.300]   On behalf of the people with the pro.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   They're listening is it a linear process?
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.660]   It's not a question where at step three you have to look at some numbers and figure out
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.620]   okay if this then you have to punch in this number.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.140]   Well we're here you have to do a ROT 13 to turn this clear text and then criminal text.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   It's much easier.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   Something like that.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   So here's the deal.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.780]   I have an iPhone in the box I picked up yesterday.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.420]   You download the program independence.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.140]   You also need to download firmware from Apple.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.780]   That's one hole they could easily plug that they haven't for reasons I'm not sure.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.060]   Once you have those files on your system this is a GUI interface now and you follow
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.060]   them steps that's literally a button push.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.460]   It tells you in order.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.180]   They independence yeah she's probably using use any sim.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.660]   I don't know anything about any sim.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.380]   There's a there's a wiki for this.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.340]   Yeah you want to you want to do the iPhone dev stuff don't use this stuff that's not
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.580]   for my phone dev team these guys.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.620]   You go to this iPhone dot 540.net.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.620]   I don't know that one.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.620]   It's like it's a wiki.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.420]   If you tried that yeah that works great.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.740]   I said brick my phone when I did that one I had to restore it with that's not a brick.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.260]   So we should be very careful about it.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.420]   It was a it was a temporary brick right.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.380]   If you want to see what a brick looks like I've got a WRT 54 G I can show you.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.340]   That's what a that's what a change of firmware on that.
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.140]   I interrupt I think I interrupted in the middle of a firmware upgrade.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.060]   So now I'm using my Apple Extreme.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.060]   Maybe that's where we are wrong.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.800]   We tried to use any sim and that simply doesn't work tell her to go to it's on Google
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.260]   code it's called independence.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.940]   It's it's code dot Google dot com slash P slash independence since also needs.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.940]   That's ironic.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.500]   Did you see on was a global nerdy today?
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.420]   Do you do you read global nerdy?
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   What's global nerdy?
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.420]   Oh my god.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.660]   It's such a great site.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.780]   It's it's I think it's it's Joey the accordion guy does it.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.260]   And it's all kinds of just great nerdy stuff.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.620]   The latest one is did a blabby Google employee spill the beans about the G phone.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.660]   And it's a story of this woman running into the Emeryville Apple store and going oh my
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.420]   gosh they're only giving G phones to 30 people at Google right now and I need to buy one
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   of these.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.580]   And Google employee and everybody turns and goes boo.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.140]   And then she's changed the subject very quickly.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.140]   Oh wow.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.100]   So yeah it's just kind of interesting that on the Google code site you'll go and find
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.140]   this well Google code allows anybody to put anything.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.140]   I know.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.220]   I bet that just that meant before to talk about later though at the rumor of a G phone.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.220]   Uh huh.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.660]   This by the way allows you to do wallpapers applications.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.020]   It independence is a great start and it makes it very easy to get this thing done.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:23:00.020]   It's not you know anyway it's I don't think it's that difficult.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.980]   I guess that the point is it's happening.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.980]   It's out there.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.380]   Apple's going to do everything they can to stop it.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.180]   Anybody who's got an unlocked iPhone would be sensible not to update.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.020]   What is Apple going to do in that update though that makes people want to.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.500]   I think that's the next that next logical question is we know they're going to add the
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.620]   Amazon store is the Wi-Fi store enough to get people to want to do this update.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.420]   Maybe they'll put something else in there at the Amazon store at the wireless.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.220]   Not Amazon Starbucks.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.340]   I'm I'm all talking about Amazon store in just a bit because I have to say this is another
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.340]   big.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340]   Shank it.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.140]   And by the way fantastic.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.140]   Really easy to use.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.140]   Oh my gosh.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.060]   This is much more than I realize it was going to be after trying unbox.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.340]   It was like I don't want to do this.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.740]   All right let's talk about it.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.460]   You're saying they're going to try.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.660]   So you're going to put something in this year.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.740]   Yeah I think Apple's got to put something in this update to make people go.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.900]   Oh no.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.100]   I've got to run this update.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.420]   And that's what I think they should do.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.980]   I mean both as an Apple user and an Apple evangelist and Apple stockholder.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.300]   I want Apple to fight this problem by saying we're going to be so good that you want to
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.460]   use this.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.460]   That's the right way.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.620]   That's the right way to do it.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.420]   I might say that they would have had this problem if they'd allowed third party applications
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.540]   and maybe done an unlocked phone to begin with.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.700]   But yeah let's see what would you suspect they would add.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.700]   Maybe third party.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.100]   I wonder if people keep breaking into your house.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.100]   You lock your doors.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.660]   I think the lockers are thinking to see the Wi-Fi store and the Starbucks thing happening.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.940]   I think people will like that.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.220]   But I think we're going to see a couple other goodies related to stuff they're doing for
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.220]   the European phones.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.500]   Yeah you got to do something else I think.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.260]   You have to make it so that people are going to really feel some pain if they don't update.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.260]   Nothing.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.540]   Well you're thinking that for most people there's going to be an active decision about
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.660]   whether they want to apply a certain update or not.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.900]   I think that 99% of the people they see a new update and they automatically download
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   and install it.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.340]   I'm talking about these evil unlockers.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.340]   Oh okay.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.820]   They need to hurt them.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.780]   How they're going to hurt them.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.780]   What you really want to do is make something so compelling that the unlockers don't think
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.140]   twice and just do it and then they have a brick in their hands.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.340]   Well what you want to do is make it so they can un-brick it and get back in line.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.380]   Yeah that's why I think a brick is a bad idea.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.900]   Yeah I mean a total brick is a bad idea.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.100]   I'm on record of saying I don't want them to do that.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.300]   I don't think they should do that.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.060]   No what they should do is you're right exactly make it so that the unlock doesn't work anymore.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.100]   Yeah I just say come on back into the fold we got new stuff for you.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.660]   AT&T is waiting.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.660]   Yeah I think that's the way to do it.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.580]   I don't purpose I don't believe for a minute they're going to purposely brick and I mean
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.020]   brick phones.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.980]   I think that some phones will be brick because people won't know how to get back.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.420]   I think if Apple's smart they'll make a clean path back for people.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:49.020]   They bring your phone to the genius bar we'll fix you back up no problems and that's the
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.500]   way to do it and if they keep adding services and they keep doing a good job people want
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   to use the product.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.580]   Yeah you know what they could do like a teacher you know who takes away your slingshot they
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.380]   can make it they could do something that where you have to take it in.
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:06.180]   So let's say they run some kind of an update and it bongs your phone and says basically
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.900]   they take this into the genius store to have it restored.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.140]   That'll be one way to kind of out people and give some kind of a.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.620]   No they should they should do the same thing that like the Miami police do to get in people
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.620]   without standing warrants.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.460]   They say no you win a free vote.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.460]   There's a there's a new T-Mobile amnesty program we will give you a thousand dollars and free
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.700]   iTunes credit if you come in with your unlocked phone.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.180]   Just let us take a look at it for about five seconds.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.980]   That's how chief Wigam got all this people he said he was giving away a free vote.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.580]   He felt down your guns.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.060]   Smelt down your bones.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.380]   So let's talk about this Amazon store.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.740]   Have you purchased anything from it yet Merlin?
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.440]   I did I went in I heard it this morning I was kind of groggy heard it this morning on
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:50.060]   morning edition and I just just for fun just dove in and yeah it's the only thing is you
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.180]   do have to have this.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.620]   There's an area to have it.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.020]   You don't okay well so long story short you go to Amazon you click they've got what something
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.140]   like two million mp3's.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.380]   One protected 256 kilobits MPDRM's.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:09.020]   Yeah no DRM and it's pretty good it's not it's you know it's interface wise it's you
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:14.060]   know e-music like it's not as awesome as the iTunes store but as far as going in and grabbing
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.500]   a track it was it was a breeze and it's 80.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.700]   What I bought was 89 cents.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.180]   You need the question.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.780]   Pardon me it's 256 kilobits mp3.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.780]   Oh no no.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.260]   That's pretty strong.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.020]   I got the press release this morning you keeps in as soon as a jaded old tech pundit you
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.500]   think okay first low quality second you need a special installer you need a special and
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.420]   then every day as I'm looking through this press release and then as I'm going to the
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.940]   site it's like wow there's absolutely nothing wrong with this you download an mp3 just like
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.380]   you're downloading from some street band that you saw in Harvard Square today it's awful
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.380]   awesome.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.540]   You do download a client if you want to buy an album because it's a downloader but one
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.220]   of the nice things about the client is it moves it automatically into iTunes.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.220]   So it's a pretty easy to take that I mean I have to say this is good enough that before
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.340]   I buy an album on iTunes or a song on iTunes I'm going to check Amazon first.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.540]   It's also I want to point out cheaper in many cases.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:14.060]   I think it's kind of weird though that like so I went in and bought this I bought a Bishop
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.620]   Allen track and it just seems kind of funny to me it looks like they haven't integrated
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:23.260]   it with the actual music the CD purchases yet because if it were me yeah in our Amazon
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.580]   right I would say oh you know what you can buy this and if you're Amazon Prime you'll
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.980]   get it tomorrow or you can download the tracks from right here but that's just a matter of
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.980]   time.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.620]   That's because no but think about that though think about the Amazon Amazon has got to be
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.900]   up there with Wiki Wikipedia in terms of Google juice so you go out and you search on a band
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.740]   and you land on an Amazon page and you're one click away from buying a song think about
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.580]   that iTunes doesn't have that do they does it has that does it does it does not it's
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.180]   not a it's not a now they do have a link back
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.180]   this is interesting from the download music to the CD store so I just search for Sinatra
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:04.020]   it says see all 1663 mp3 song results and then right below it shop for Sinatra in our
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.500]   Amazon CD store so they've got that other link going no and that is a disadvantage I
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.900]   do test it's not a browser it's not it's a it's a dedicated right yeah well I don't
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:19.580]   think a couple of things I think it's good I think it's the best iTunes want to be side
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:27.500]   I've seen so far but yeah the problem left hand compliment the problem is is that I've
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   heard this story so many times we've got the new iTunes killer and just yesterday I think
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.700]   Virgin shuttered its attempt I mean how many of these things have gone by the way it's
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.900]   it's first it's that it's an iTunes killer I think I think it could be an iTunes killer
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.420]   don't you let me like it's just it's an iTunes competitor and it's gonna hold apples feet
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.940]   to the fire and not be in douchebags about the stuff they do with their music it's not
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.640]   iTunes killer it's more like a motivation for
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.940]   I think it's such a such a foul seat ready to embrace unlock software unlock it's a viable
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.380]   competitor it's the first level competitor absolutely and on the internet like I just
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.420]   I really I there this whole idea that there's got to be like one company that takes all
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.660]   the oxygen out of the space like okay whatever maybe but no I mean Amazon think about Amazon's
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.180]   customer base you know how many people buy Amazon stuff every day me my blowing I bet
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.940]   you it's a damn site more than Apple I think it's I think it's good I just the couple things
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:23.180]   are this is this I do want to make the point I think it is good for iTunes to get a competitor
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.940]   I think all the previous ones have sucked I hope this one turns out to be no Scott you're
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:34.580]   just another one of these Amazon haters haven't even seen you know I can I just say I use
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.540]   it I use it you're out there and you're saying the battery life is not going to be any good
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:43.100]   you haven't even tried it yet I used it today I think it's I do think it's good why would
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.020]   you buy something if wait a minute let's see no I thought they had Beatles but they have
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.940]   all these other beat non-beadles related stuff what why would you buy something copy
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:59.420]   protected in 128 kilobits AAC for more money if you could go to the Amazon store maybe
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:05.580]   it's a little more difficult and buy it for 89 cents I'm good circuit about it not actually
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.820]   fitting in with all my iTunes stuff is one thing and and I hope that Apple doesn't do
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.020]   something to make it so that you can't do it did not hear something recently they're trying
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.140]   to make it so that you can't take the iTunes songs out or something I was doing some bad
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.140]   stuff let me see it would absolutely fit in the metadata is in there it's got cover art
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:29.180]   it's it's it's it's indistinguishable from any kind of an mp3 you rip yourself let me see
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:34.020]   I'm going to show design let me see do I have album art yep I got album art shows up and
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.900]   cover flow interesting it's showing up as a variety of different bit rates they must be
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:45.220]   using VBR they are they're using VBR in it that's kind of surprising well I mean the
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:50.540]   incentive to use iTunes still is that it's at least in this 1.0 beta of what Amazon's
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.620]   doing it's a lot easier to browse and find music that you don't know you're interested
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:01.180]   in on the iTunes store than it is on Amazon.com maybe I agree the other wireless download
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.180]   feature that will come out yeah they're gonna be glad they have that now it's interesting
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:11.780]   is encoded with lame it is encoded VBR now lambs claims a good encoder but it's an open
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.900]   source encoder which is kind of interesting that that name wasn't come up with by marketing
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.620]   people I know you don't get that on the side of a bus Amazon.com all of our music is encoded
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:26.740]   with lame at a fundamental level it looks like it has the full mp3 tags I mean it's
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.580]   it's got track numbers it's got year out artists it's got I mean it's got the extended
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.300]   stuff I don't know the exactly what version this is but it's got good meditax yeah it's
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.380]   pretty good lame it's a good encoder there's no doubt about that I'm impressed and I tell
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:44.500]   you at that bit right without D and again how do they get these albums to be without
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.180]   DRM I don't understand I want to know how they negotiated they haven't you wait they
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.460]   have they haven't gotten into the deal yeah I mean the reason that they don't have all
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:57.660]   the all of the record companies is because they aren't doing any DRM but I think that
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:02.940]   what they are getting a record companies that that need Apple to be pushed this is this
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.060]   is an anti Apple move by the record companies is what it is absolute absolutely you know
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.940]   and they're this so they're giving they're giving away you know they're saying well we
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.300]   could have given this to you but we're gonna we're not going to we're gonna give it to
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.700]   Amazon because they want to build Amazon up I think it's just universal I mean who's
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.860]   on here it's universal and there's somebody else I mean I'm not sure who in this part
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.700]   of the if you're there's a lot of indies to I believe yeah I think this is fantastic it's
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.020]   pretty impressive the last track I bought this morning was a kind of obscure thing that
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:35.340]   I saw on YouTube and whereas I just did account iTunes has 42 different covers of this song
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:40.700]   Amazon has 14 including basically the same eight or nine they're the most popular in iTunes
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.780]   so it's not like one thing looking at the house no me I was looking for close no me on
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.940]   iTunes you couldn't get it there oh totally clips that's my close no impersonation one
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.340]   thing I do note if you do a search it is at least included in the category suggestion
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.700]   so I just did a search on death cab and I get the records I get apparel and then I do
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.180]   MP3 downloads I think you're right Leo I think it's something where that's probably an integration
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.340]   thing where they just have it just a matter of time otherwise they would be leaving money
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:10.300]   on the table not to do that yeah that cab for ugly that cute yeah death cab for cutie
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.660]   you're a scott but here's the most important point that you warm your milk up for you you
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:20.740]   made it right away Merlin I think it's a really good point is you google death cab for cutie
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:25.460]   how high up is Amazon gonna show it looks like it's showing up at number seven in the
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:32.100]   death cab for cutie search and then if it goes to download this song I mean now it doesn't
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.140]   won't right away because of course this is new and Google hasn't had a chance to index
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:41.460]   it but how long before you get that I think that's gonna be a killer application Google
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:47.340]   is a much more of a in some ways a better interface than iTunes right at least you search
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.760]   for it and you find it yeah it's you know that the problem is I think that it the challenges
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.320]   now I have to say that I'm gonna probably start buying some stuff from the Amazon store
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:04.640]   I you know like for instance my my I looked up the police regatta to Blanc which is 999
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:13.340]   on the iTunes store and 797 for 256 bit you know non DRM on the Amazon store so I'm saving
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.440]   two bucks and I'm getting better better content so for stuff that I know that I'm looking
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:23.420]   for I think that that's gonna make sense in a lot of cases I think that the issue though
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:29.180]   is that is that you know the I just get frustrated with web interfaces like what if I you know
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:36.380]   remember I have an Amazon affiliate account right so I make some money what if I put on
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:42.660]   my blog oh here's my five favorite album download them right now yep that's a pretty
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:49.640]   good interface I mean that is that adds serendipity that adds I mean I think that you know Amazon
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.080]   has really knows how to do retail I would be a little nervous of I'm not saying it's
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.720]   an iTunes killer iTunes isn't going away but act this works with iTunes which I think is
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.800]   very interesting but what I think is interesting is I wonder how much the record companies are
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.200]   getting out of this I bet you it's not as much as they're getting from Apple so I think
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.120]   they see it but they see it as an investment just to kind of cause some competition because
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.340]   Amazon rarely gives more than half do you think do you think that this is one of those
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:19.100]   moves where they give it away cheap and then they try to put Apple out of business and then
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:25.020]   Jack the price up I don't think that I can I just want to I want to make note of everybody
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.260]   who's excited and thrilled about this now in case it were to become the dominant force
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:34.220]   so that I can listen to you all then be rated later well nobody wants nobody wants anybody
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.860]   to become dominant and that's what's exciting about this it challenges what is essentially
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.800]   now very close to a monopoly you've been a starry eyed fanboy for like eight months
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.820]   about the iPhone now something legitimately awesome comes out and delivers and you're
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.740]   like I just want to see what you guys think about this well you know you know what I mean
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.300]   once what do I do months before the iPhone came out we're actually looking at the uber
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:00.140]   that I said you know what's retroact go back and not have had so many conversations about
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.900]   the I think what's really interesting is that there's not there's no copy protection on
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:09.060]   it and I think you know we've been saying for the last month or so ever since Steve's letter
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.220]   this is the end of copy protection DRM is going to start to fall you know what's interesting
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.700]   is that all of a sudden Amazon is putting their money where Steve's mouth is well here's
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.340]   it's not it's not you know Steve wants to do that the issue is the record companies aren't
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.980]   letting Apple do it they're giving it to Amazon instead you know that's the that's the so
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.700]   what they're doing is they're not letting Apple have the non DRM they're only letting
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.340]   Amazon do it because they're specifically trying to build this one up so it's not that Steve
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.980]   wants to keep DRM he wants it to be like what you see in Amazon it's just that you they
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.500]   don't the record companies are specifically trying to build up a competitor because they
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.060]   haven't spent enough energy doing this up until now and everybody gets bloodied I don't
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.740]   know whether I personally I could see myself buying a bunch of stuff I still don't think
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.660]   that a web interface is competitive with iTunes I think there's a lot of problems with iTunes
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.340]   but I don't think that they're I think that they could take a big chunk of the market and
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.500]   it could be a very successful thing I just don't think it's gonna make a big chunk because
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.780]   I think that that embedded interface where you're totally in immersed in that where you're
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.260]   keeping your music where you're downloading stuff I think that's it's a much more efficient
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:14.220]   interface yeah but they have they have another big advantage in that as yet iTunes will not
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:19.940]   pay me for recommending songs to other people for us Amazon.com will do that there's an
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:24.980]   affiliate program there's an iTunes affiliate program oh yeah it's this totally janky third
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.140]   party I think it's called Link synergy or something I've used it a little I use it for you can
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:33.420]   also you can refer people for to dot Mac you can refer I make a lot of money with Amazon
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.620]   affiliate referrals I mean that's a very lucrative
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:43.380]   Amazon makes it much much simpler though yeah yeah there's nothing Google ads on your site
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.860]   there's nothing in the build a link section yet that I can say I will say if Amazon did
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.820]   do something that number one is like like right now like you know I can't even I can't
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:57.260]   even I mean this is version one so it's fine but I can't even like resort by album or you
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.500]   know by song title or bread price or by any you know that stuff is I think I can buy price
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.820]   but a lot of these are you can't you know the sorting isn't nearly as you know straightforward
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.260]   you know as I said I just don't I always find web pages to be kind of I think you're probably
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.260]   right I think this is going to be a destination it's where people go when they know what they
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.300]   want to buy and it's very quick and easy to if you know what you want you just put it
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:24.540]   in there and you buy it but I mean also you know you know we're we're fanboys of Apple
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.980]   and Max and we love iTunes and and Alex and I in particular will just always you know beat
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   the hell out of anybody but how great iTunes is I love iTunes it's fantastic but how about
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.420]   the rest of the freaking world and just the kind of market bludgeoning that Amazon has
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.020]   it their disposal I don't think you can write that off and and the fact that you know yeah
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.940]   whatever it's not perfect yet in terms of sorting and stuff like that but people understand
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:51.140]   Amazon well so I think I think of Amazon took some money and they built a an actual they
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:56.180]   took that download or app or whatever and built an actual iTunes like net app it would
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.860]   go head to head with Apple and it would be a real problem a lot of people a lot of people
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.460]   don't like iTunes I mean let's the thing is where again let's remember let's remember
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.820]   the color of our crystal here there are a lot of people who don't love iTunes and especially
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:11.020]   people on Windows and especially people on Linux what are they gonna what are they doing
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.660]   for iTunes nowadays right you can you can leave the web interface here I just think that
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.340]   if you had a net app that that also fed into the same database and downloaded the same
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.940]   thing for you it's a sinking is it a sinking issue for you yeah I just don't I don't like
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:27.100]   going up to the web you know I like I mean just take the web in general I just you know
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.060]   it's just a it's just this clunky you know it's always this clunky interface with all
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.740]   the things I would disagree with you the web is just is it's it's the what Amazon will
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:40.940]   do is they'll build RSS they'll build all the standard API's to this you will see the
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:45.460]   Amazon store and music in the Amazon store everywhere and I don't think that I think
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.100]   you're thinking in terms of that Amazon web page I think that's maybe the last place you
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.740]   will end up I think that the web is much more flexible than I do I wouldn't write off the
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.660]   web by the web so then go from I mean look at how many people use Facebook every day they
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.580]   don't you know they don't need a Facebook application people understand web pages what
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.860]   I he doesn't like Facebook yeah I can't even go to that I think a real test I'm like I'm
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.940]   gonna use so therefore people don't use the real test will be I'm gonna see how long it
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.980]   takes my kids to figure this out right yeah and and watch what you gotta watch what young
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.620]   people do you know right now they go to a line wire line wire ain't that easy to use but
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:24.860]   they managed to figure it out that's a killer feature Leo you can you can't deny that free
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:30.460]   I think the main value this will be to perhaps cause the iTunes folks to look at this and
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.780]   say okay there's some things we can adopt here that will will help us and I'd like to
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.460]   see the iTunes thing worked out because I'm kind of with Alex I like having an application
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.100]   on my desktop that that handles this also you know I don't know if they're gonna do
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:51.180]   podcast and you know all the other things that you can get in the one stop sort of iTunes
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:55.900]   approach I do think I looked at the Sony one I looked at the Virgin when I looked at all
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.660]   of these that have come out I do think this is the best one to come out so far I do think
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.340]   there holes in it I mean this is definitely the first one this is definitely the first
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.900]   one that I looked at and said I'm actually gonna buy stuff from I mean this is so that's
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:12.540]   a big push I'll be honest though if I had to choose between one big huge transforming
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:17.460]   feature for iTunes store to get it wouldn't be DRM free everywhere it would be a subscription
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:24.580]   model because I just I disagree with I disagree with you Scott the urge service I really really
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.700]   enjoyed when it first came out before as always it got abandoned and left by the side of the
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:33.900]   road not until you suddenly realize that wow there are 8 billion gajillion songs and albums
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.820]   on this service and I can have any one of them that I want for as long as I want it's long
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.780]   to keep coming up with a but a pretty trivial amount of money every single every single
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.460]   month I was listening to a lot more music and I was really broadening my horizons a lot
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.500]   during the two or three months that I was testing it out I have to say I agree with you
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.100]   I tried it on the zoom and it's pretty cool you load up and if you if it's your first
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:58.140]   mp3 player you just plug it in and load it up you know I I've given iPods to a lot of
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.900]   people who have never used iTunes or had an iPod before and that's a big barrier filling
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.220]   that thing up if you don't have a lot of digitized music already what are you gonna buy buy all
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.580]   these albums one by one I think I think the new 160 gig iPod it doesn't have that sticker
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.300]   that says please don't don't steal music it has a stick that says oh who the hell are
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:23.380]   we kidding 160 gigs go for it you know we were talking about the share that Amazon might
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:29.300]   be sharing with the music companies I don't understand this at all but Jean Bernard Levy
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.540]   who is the CEO of Vivandi who is of course the big music company one of the big three
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:41.260]   music companies and owner of Universal Music Group was berating Apple's split they said
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.900]   this he said the split between Apple and Prudil sales is indecent our contracts give
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:52.220]   two good a share to Apple he said waving his big loaf of bread you know I think his
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.740]   furrain is for sure I think you'll get a direction he said that Universal gets and
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:02.660]   this is the first time we've heard anybody admit this 70 cents out of each 99 cents song
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.940]   and he said that's not enough okay and let's put this in perspective minimum minimum charge
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.460]   if you know if you buy a bunch of them it's not quite this bad but minimum charge on a
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:17.740]   single song from Visa is 25 cents so there's 95 cents download is you know a couple pennies
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:22.140]   so Apple you know they're making they're losing money there yeah I mean they they're probably
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.140]   not losing money but they're probably making maybe a penny each now of course what he's
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:31.060]   saying is he wants to see I want the song definitely we don't get a dollar per iPod is
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.340]   what he's saying you know it's in DC you want you're right that's what they want doesn't
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:42.340]   that guy look a little bit like peppy with food sounds like him oh I wonder what they
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:47.540]   do our French friends across the sea we say Aloha thank you for listening fire sponsors
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:54.420]   merchandise we like you oh boy they know they know they know hey I'm an email that Americans
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:59.260]   have a certain stereotype and boy are we they talk like this when they talk about Americans
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:07.620]   it's okay hey Leo are you gonna shoot some guns later exactly yeah I can't get us some
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.920]   pigeons put them in a cage and go shoot him and call it hey I have an idea let's get
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:18.100]   drunk and fail to appreciate jazz music I understand there's some nature that still
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.940]   has some bendy spoiled I got the pickup truck let's go and we've just been listening to
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:33.700]   our impression of French people believe it or not on the night oh don't you think that's
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:38.740]   pretty amazing that this this guy is is saying 70 cents is not enough what's wrong with all
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.540]   is everybody wants it all everybody wants their side to have it all everybody says we
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.140]   should have it all I'm starting to feel sorry for Apple there we were we were attacking
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.660]   Apple now we love them now we love them I didn't say it's a lot of love I said I felt sorry
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:56.700]   for it say again Andy I was saying Steve we're we're fickle that way we apologize
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:03.420]   I didn't try to have an loyalty we like it when you try to do that we're doing what
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:08.660]   we can Microsoft is announced pricing for Mac Office 2008 I think ours technical Jackie
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:12.900]   Chang got it right when she said they're taking a lesson out of Apple's iPhone PR book
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.340]   make a new story every day so that people keep thinking about you they now have said
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.180]   that it will be $3.99.95 same price as a current office suite and there will be the
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:31.380]   traditional student discount which I think the student and $4 yeah yeah no no I think
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:37.720]   it's a hundred fifty bucks for students anybody care not me I have to say I'm liking pages
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.700]   and numbers an awful lot to yeah I'm I'm done I think the only people buy Microsoft
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.320]   Office are people who have to because they work with Windows users right but you can
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.500]   you know the page I said it oh boy all at once and that really gets crazy in here go
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:57.020]   ahead Alex you can you can save out none of the one place that you that that is really
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:01.260]   really valuable within word that was added to pages that but you couldn't integrate back
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.300]   and forth between word and pages I don't think is the versioning you know so that you know
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.780]   when you're working with some with a bunch of people on a document and everyone's adding
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:13.220]   you know doing this and move stuff over that is very very valuable and it wasn't available
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.020]   in pages and now that it is I you know pages will save out to a word document so you can
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:21.340]   save it out to as a word document send it to your friend it's on a PC and it's fine
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.620]   but I don't think it keeps on that that versioning I have to say though the pages versioning
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.340]   is so much nicer than the word versioning I mean that's the way to do it yeah well just
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.100]   know there isn't even any need to go as complicated as pages I think that for seventy five percent
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.020]   of all the people who do word processing Google documents will do every every that they're
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:43.540]   likely to use in pages that pages has the twenty percent of features that some other
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.020]   people are going to be using and Microsoft Word will have the five percent that are required
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.380]   if you're going to be writing something long form or something incredibly collaborative
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:57.100]   yeah my problem is I write my problem is I write on a plane and I can't get to any of
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.580]   the Google services that's always my you know I'm not connected most of the time that I'm
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.020]   actually that's where my prediction comes in my prediction that I'm going to make every
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.780]   week that they're going to tighten their relationship with Apple and you're going to have a way
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.740]   to sync this stuff on dot Mac and you're going to be able to take stuff with you that's my
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.460]   prediction I'm surprised they still have I'm surprised I still haven't gotten really
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.340]   good integration between documents and iPhone because that's a kind of a killer feature
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:26.060]   oh completely you can do it it's really janky I just wrote this about the some 43 folders
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:31.140]   the other day you can go in and log in I sometimes think this is an illusion but you go in and
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.940]   you can actually go into your Google documents and edit them it sucks because it's no fun
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:41.140]   to edit on an iPhone if you HTML don't you no not at all and I've had yeah I've had no
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.380]   problem getting in you can get in I see I've been finding that you can get in and you can
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:50.660]   see your documents you can open them but you can't once any instance of what you really
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.220]   need to have a keyboard the keyboard doesn't pop up unless you're clicking the button for
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:49:00.140]   HTML editing and that point you know the the keyboard awakes from slumber and and crawls
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:04.540]   from the from the crypt but otherwise you can look but you can't touch I'll revisit that
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.980]   I will look again I'll make sure that was not all those hold I am in I am I'm stinky I am
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.620]   sleep deprived I'm unshaven because my iPhone book it has this drop deadline in three and
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.020]   a half days I'm going through every single chapter and making sure the things that were
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:22.700]   true five weeks ago or even one week ago are still true I will check out I will check
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.700]   out I keep going back to Google documents because I'm saying my god Google Reader was
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:32.220]   ready the day before the iPhone came up well they putting documents on I met the Google
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:37.100]   reader a programmer waiting in line for my iPhone and he said he stayed up late that
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.140]   that night the night before making sure that it worked nicely on the iPhone
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.580]   yeah wow and of course there are lots of good tricks and I hope you buy my book to find
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:48.340]   those out readers for practicing you know we're documents and stuff remotely but still
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.660]   it's like oh god I know that the week after this thing gets locked down there's going to
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.540]   be I dot I docs dot Google dot com and it's going to be the most awesome thing ever yeah
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.180]   I'm just looking right now at the upper part nothing at the Gmail blog and it looks like
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:08.020]   they just released an update to Google calendar that's iPhone friendly and I really want to
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:12.620]   try it but I don't want to make turn my phone on and make it make that noise go ahead really
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.980]   you get you get a friendly looking apparently get a pretty friendly if you go to it's a
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:22.820]   Gmail blog dot blogspot dot com the latest entry will show you looks pretty pretty sexy
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:28.460]   what is the address that I go to on the iPhone calendar dot Google dot com oh just the regular
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.940]   Google calendar yeah and login oh that's cool I've been using spanning sync your recommendation
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:38.260]   and it works great cool isn't it funny to use it isn't it funny how I was talking about
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.620]   this on the site today it's funny how I end up using it in reverse I think it's designed
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.060]   to be used as something where I type stuff into I cal and then that goes to my Google
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:49.820]   calendar and I totally use it the opposite way everything in G cal now and I just wanted
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.620]   to be able to sync to dot Mac so I just use it to sync back to the I cal right now I think
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.060]   you should be able to enter it wherever you are did you I thought you were a plexomand
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:03.180]   doesn't talk so as well it got built in sinking right they do to go but the Google calendar
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:08.580]   sinking I'll flaky but I have been using that yeah actually now oh my god I wonder if I've
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:14.620]   crossed the beams oh no you're gonna have like 15 in the same phone call I might be in
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:21.660]   trouble by the way this news just in phone news dot com is saying that they there's some
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:27.380]   reason to think that Apple may have violated federal warranty laws the Magnuson Moss act
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:34.300]   by saying that hacking the iPhone violates its warranty you know that's just not a certain
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.900]   lawyer now I'm with meta gunpoint and stealing back your your autograph footballs I'm sorry
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:45.700]   that's not gonna make it an inside edition it's a little complicated the apparently the
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:51.100]   Magnuson Moss warranty act states that Apple cannot avoid a warranty for a product with
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:58.420]   third party enhancements or modifications unless it damages the product so they are in a press
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.260]   that they're claiming claiming the damage exemption they've already said that oh they
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:13.380]   are yeah okay by the way the Google calendar looks beautiful on the iPhone oh oh my gosh
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:23.860]   it works it's got a quick ad oh okay I'm gonna leave you guys for a minute hold on okay I'm
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:29.380]   better now and once and once there's some kind of a way to deal with your contacts I
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.620]   know there's contacts built into Gmail but if they can pull that stuff together man that's
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:37.340]   what's really missing isn't it yeah that had to do list up if there were some kind of basic
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:43.140]   task management maybe synced with iCal for example yeah this look have you looked at it
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:48.820]   Merlin no it's gorgeous I don't want to make the noise oh now what would be the motivation
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:54.260]   for using this instead of the built-in calendar app because it's Google Calendar so I guess
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.780]   there's some advantage to that it's Google year yes well if you're and if you're on a
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:03.860]   Windows machine yeah right it's just universal it's also shared calendars if you want to share
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.100]   calendars and that kind of thing wow it looks like they you know they really Google's done
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:14.420]   a good job of making it fit the iPhone meme oh I think we better get to our picks here before

[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:37.220]   I got a couple of them I try to make things timely I want this podcast to be as timely as
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:42.180]   today's headlines which actually that would make them 36 hours old as timely as today's dig.com
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:48.660]   I could put it out now. Damn so by the time you oh damn it. Why are you listening to us?
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:56.820]   I'm sorry. We're wasting time. No no no no no we're not. Leo they're an hour to the podcast
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.540]   they know by now we've been wasting their time. I know I've been wasting you guys time.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:08.260]   If they don't know that about us already it's too late. Exactly this is no no no no warranty
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:15.060]   expressed or implied. Sorry this podcast may brick your sense of technology and your appreciation
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.660]   of what if it doesn't we'll figure out a way to make it do so quick.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:26.580]   I got I got two things one is pimpmysofari.com which yeah I know that some people are going to
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.180]   be very familiar with that but it's one of those sites where I can't believe it's been around for
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:36.260]   so long and I've just found it just a couple of weeks ago. You're used to the customizable web
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.660]   browser in the world being Firefox the one you can add plugins to the ones you can pay if we
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:45.940]   change and add all kinds of features to not everybody knows that Safari is just as customizable
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:51.300]   and pimpmysofari.com is the one resource you need that will show you everything that you can do
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:56.900]   with Safari that wasn't capable it wasn't capable of when it left the factory. Any tasks that you
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:01.700]   that you're really interested in be it to automator actions things require apple script special book
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:08.100]   marks all kinds of different things. I've basically almost had to create a second copy of Safari on
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.820]   a second machine just because I want to install all these really cool things before I decided okay
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:17.220]   I really don't want the big bet orange button that's distracts me from the thing I want to do
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:22.100]   that all that was fun but I'm going to remove it now but again it's the you'll lose a good couple
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.700]   hours playing through this because there's so many interesting and cool things you can do with it.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.420]   It's kind of neat you know I until you see that site you don't realize how programmable Safari is
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:35.940]   I mean mail is and I guess they made this Safari very easy to modify. They also call out the the
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:41.620]   classic at the very top the I'm on the about page here site designed by my good internet friend
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:45.860]   Mr. John Hicks the essentials I totally agree I don't know if you agree Andy but
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:51.620]   saft pith helmet and safari stand yeah yeah that'll change your world those three right there
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:56.820]   and like change the world today. I gave a demo not knowing that I still had these things plugged in
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.940]   and question number one was what the why is your browser doing that?
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:04.980]   Where are the ads? Do you like the fact that it does it or do you not like the fact that it
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:08.340]   does like it oh well because I'm a clever person and it was not a customized Safari.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:14.900]   Yes this is this is this is an open API I mean is apple making this possible or is it's people
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:19.860]   figure out how to hack around with it. Mostly it's just input managers I think I mean and then
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.740]   there are a lot of them are going to go away and right leopard breaks input managers yeah
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.460]   pith helmet says he doesn't know if it's going to work.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:35.620]   That's one of the things I really think that made firefox so popoatin was these extensions
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:39.380]   and apple be wise to keep those going somehow.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:45.140]   Yeah okay that was one pit my safari excellent I've got another one with the one that says
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:50.820]   as good as fresh as yesterday's headlines I just got an email from Scott Kurtz our good internet
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:56.660]   friend he's the artist creator ran Puba of the pvp online comics trip and has included us in
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.500]   various episodes I might add exactly thank you thank you for the live journal avatar scott
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:04.260]   I should probably have asked I should probably have to review permission first but no
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:12.260]   information wants to be free scotch about that first but he's having a book sale I believe
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.980]   or not I like web comics but I also like physical books you can put on your shelf and carry in a
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:22.340]   car with you and give to people because it's you know a URL makes it pretty crappy Christmas present
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:27.220]   but an actual book especially giving them the ability to essentially download six months worth
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:32.020]   of comics at once that's a good gift and he's having a sale on his books with a very very
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:37.780]   interesting special if you buy all four volumes which are discounted to close to about close to
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:42.420]   20% off the book pack is normally about 50 bucks it's down to 40 dollars but if you buy the book
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:47.700]   pack he will not only autograph them he will also draw a sketch in the book of your choice and
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.700]   now I'm speaking I haven't talked I haven't talked to Scott about this but I'm pretty
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:57.940]   comfortable knowing his work ethic that you'll basically get 300 Klingons fighting one million
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.340]   Persian soldiers just like the scenes from 300 on every single page he will draw that for you
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:06.820]   and if you send him pictures of your friends you'll make sure the Klingons or the Persians
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:12.100]   look like your friends so we're talking about what that's 1 million plus 300 figures all for 40
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:16.020]   dollars if it was just the artwork that would be worth the money but you also get four books
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.660]   worth of wonderful wonderful comics that's not like it's not Mac related to people what I love
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.900]   about PvP online is that the staff of the character the cast of characters they're sort of like the
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:30.580]   iron chefs of nerdliness and the iron chef of of Macintosh is a character by the name of Brent
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:35.860]   and Sienna and book number two he tries to convince one of his mac hating friends to buy an iPod
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.500]   so they can do you can do a switcher ad starring him and so it's one of my favorite series and that's
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.180]   one of the things you'll get along with that poster size and I mentioned it was poster size
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.260]   it was poster size mural size you can paste it right onto the side of your dorm room or your
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:52.500]   custom van this will look great on the site custom van all for 40 dollars that's a lot of
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:59.540]   entertainment post very cool and there's our picks for mr. Notco at cwlb.com soon to be at his new
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:06.580]   site any day now when you have an estimated time of arrival I shall be released from my bondage on
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:12.020]   the end of this week my drop deadline on the book up up up until then I'm nursing it along I should
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:17.780]   have it done I'm guessing by Halloween all right I'm doing I'm doing a stage roll out I decided to
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:24.820]   take the fine example set by the lazy butted developers of every web 2.0 app if I just put a
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.700]   sticker saying beta on the top of the math that I can get a get away with all kinds of years that
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:35.620]   design mistakes and and non-functional features for about two years so expect the beta of this to
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:41.620]   be up within the next few weeks Alex Lindsay your pick my friend so mine mine's a little bit more
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:47.220]   techy than I usually go and this is this is zero Alex this is a excuse Matt did we mention the
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:56.580]   URL of PvP online no PvP online pvp online dot com it's short for player versus player
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.180]   player versus player online all one word geez that would have been that would have been dumb
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.820]   um well we put it in the show notes next week okay Alex how many Alexes is
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:14.100]   Alexes is is one zero Alexes is zero Alexes is is is so this is this is called kismack
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:21.300]   and this is a little bit oh yeah oh yeah so that's a hacker tool dude it is a hacker tool but I don't
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.900]   I'm not actually you learned about this yeah I know who you learned about this from I'm not
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:30.020]   gonna say but I know who you learned about this from yeah when we have we have some people in the
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:36.020]   office that may or may not know a lot about kismack but so but to be honest I didn't know
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.620]   that much about it you know something that the guys uh you know played with a lot in here in the
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.740]   office and I didn't know much about it until um I had a problem with uh you know the I mean I had
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.860]   it on my computer because we were talking about it so I put it on there and it was great that I
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:52.820]   had it what happened was is that my my speak easy went under um for whatever reason his speak
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:03:01.140]   easy by the way it's not his free bar prohibition era bar but his uh internet access um but the uh
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.580]   you know speak easy that my internet provider so my internet provider wasn't going and turned out
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:12.260]   that you know my uh anyway it was it was a user error and um the uh but I couldn't get connected
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.540]   to the internet and so I couldn't figure out what the phone number was to call speak easy I
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.940]   couldn't figure out how to you know like there was no other way to get through and so I opened
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:24.820]   up kismack and what kismack will do is it will it's really um it'll cut through a lot of stuff I
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:29.060]   mean a lot of us are sitting around a lot of Wi-Fi signals that are hidden or you can't see them or
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:33.940]   you know everything else it'll give you a lot of information about what they're protected by various
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:40.900]   things like wag to hate that trivially trivially protected if you got to protect something they
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.980]   didn't want people on the network they wouldn't have put such a cheap lock on there exactly i
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:51.140]   said i used all through high school and it worked just before so we try to sell back then so so
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.180]   now I will say that I so what I did is I ran the you know I ran kismack and in my you know i'm in
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:03.140]   San Francisco and and at my apartment I can see from my Mac I can see eight signals um when I
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:09.220]   have kismack I can see 18 um and uh and then it shows the variable you know the average you know
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.020]   that mean the signal strength um and how they're encrypted and everything else and there was about
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.860]   four of them that were just completely opened you know that but it could tell me which one was the
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.820]   best one so I'm not because the problem is when you're looking at through airport it doesn't give
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:26.740]   you all this information so I just picked an open one I got a signal I went to speak easy I got it
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:31.380]   fixed and then it was and then it was over you know and but but the thing is is that you know it
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.860]   would have taken me forever I would end up going to a Starbucks or or you know I guess going very
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.260]   slowly through my iPhone trying to you know find you know figure out all the stuff and it was just
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.420]   great to be able to just kind of quickly fix this stuff now I will say you know the other thing
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:49.220]   that kismack will do that that I haven't done I don't know how to do it yet but or yet or anything
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:53.620]   else but I know people who do the other thing that kismack does is it makes you very paranoid
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:05:00.740]   about everything you do on on uh you know using Wi-Fi because uh you get very clear you know that you
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:07.540]   can cut through wpa and or at least web um very very quickly you know and so if I needed to I
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:12.500]   could have done that I didn't need to um but you can hack those signals pretty well actually into
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:18.340]   you're a very bad man I know I know I know but I didn't I didn't actually do anything but I didn't
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.980]   hack anything but uh but it was uh it was and I only used it for you know a very very quick period
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:28.180]   of time to fix mine and mine's left open I feel like it's even that I can't see even oh we're even
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.700]   well it is a good it is a good lesson in fact there's a video uh that's been going around the
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:38.100]   net for some time um how to use kismack to crack web so it is often used for that but you didn't
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:44.020]   know that no I didn't I didn't have to do any of that stuff um the uh the it was interesting though
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:49.060]   as if if you actually go to the kismack.de website um they'll actually say Germany does not let
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:54.340]   them host it anymore um in uh in Germany so they had to move it so they give you a link to where
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.820]   you can go to the Netherlands and download it because it's a threat to national security in
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:04.820]   in Germany so um so but it's wow on the site yeah yeah right kismack is the biggest threat to
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:12.020]   national security Germany so anyway that's it very good kismack all for three
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:19.860]   Sagan they're also terrified of rock and roll music but they love David Hasselhoff
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:27.940]   there you go there you go no dancing happening there so uh let us move on to mr scott bourn
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:35.220]   your pick of the week my pick is not a software pick it's not a hard pick a hard work whatever
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:41.380]   could it be it's a clothing pick it's the first ever mac berry weekly clothing pick
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.820]   I want to dress like scott bourn when somebody comes along and says I want to dress like scott
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:50.180]   bourn what do you recommend scott bourn I recommend my very own shoe lying from puma you're kidding
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:56.580]   you can go to puma shoes and you will see that they do in fact carry the scott bourn shoe
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:02.100]   has my signature on the bottom no yeah I challenge you to look at it right now
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:08.420]   and go online you'll see the scott bourn shoe it's a domain that's a big challenge love the

[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:22.580]   yeah that the world champion skateboarder is also named scott bourn and uh for some reason
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.140]   they chose his shoe over the one I had submitted would have a picture of the iphone on the bottom
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:31.300]   but you know it's still a cool product I mean how many people can buy a shoe that has their name
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.940]   on it let's play the puma scott bourn advertisement right now because scott you've lost some weight

[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:44.340]   going to pick one that I actually just found and I hadn't seen before but I'm sure going to use it
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:50.100]   called second rotation dot com anyway familiar with that it's the easy way to cash in on your
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:56.740]   gadgets you actually love this they have a little estimator you go online and you let me just type
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:03.860]   in a bricked iPhone just see so you go through the estimate is it a four or eight gigabyte
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:14.260]   bricked iPhone it is an eight gigabyte does it power on yeah AC adapter no maybe maybe rechargeable
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:20.020]   battery oh yeah original software CD didn't come with one original manuals yeah original cables
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:25.540]   sure overall condition well how many stars do you give a brick die fun depends what you mean by
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:32.500]   condition it's still physically intact and it has a very nice good calculate the estimated
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.860]   trading value 232 dollars and you can have them pay via check or PayPal if you accept the offer
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.460]   you mail it into them they check it to make sure it actually matches so they're gonna probably turn
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:46.980]   it on unfortunately they'll send you a photo of a dollar bill yeah just like I said I'm a photo of
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.060]   a phone but this is a great way to you know you're not going to get full dollar if you sold it
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.380]   yourself on eBay you'd probably get more money but what a great way to get rid of all those old
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.780]   iPhones you just don't know what to do and do they sell them sell it on eBay is that their deal I
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:03.940]   yeah I suspect I you know they don't I don't know where they uh where they sell it but I think
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:08.820]   it's a good idea I like the most personal late night TV like honey there's too much gold piling
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:13.700]   up in the house if only there was a service we could get rid of it sell your gold dot com
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.660]   we'll send you a free free free gold kit
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:28.180]   all right you don't like that I got another one well I'll save this for next time but I did get
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:34.020]   I'll give you a hint a preview I did finally get the SD5 the Panasonic hi-def camcorder
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:40.340]   and boy I love I could see why Andy and you uh I love them you have the SD1 and they're
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:46.900]   it's just great I mean I'm really impressed with the quality of this one little thing to be aware
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:53.620]   of though these files are big you need to have a much a very recent computer to even attempt to
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:58.020]   play the back or edit them and you need software that supports it which fortunately on the max
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.860]   side we're pretty good because we've got iMovie and that final cut the one thing the one thing
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.340]   I'll say is if you're making videos that you're planning to watch on your computer
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:09.780]   and not on your TV you know so if you're going to put stuff up you know really working at 960 by
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:16.180]   540 is plenty that'll help it'll help a lot yeah in fact there's a bug in iMovie that stretches out
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:22.020]   the 1080 for some reason there's a one there's a bug in iMovie that stretches the 1080 they say
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:27.140]   they're gonna fix that soon have you noticed that haven't but I've been capturing most of the stuff
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.300]   I capture up the camera I view the cameras kind of my oh yeah you capture right to the iMovie
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:37.300]   the iMac so I'm capturing straight into iMovie at 960 by 540 most of the time if I want something
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:42.020]   bigger I have a bigger camera I might so so so I just do the 960 by 540 that means it's going to be
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:48.340]   one quarter the the bandwidth you know so a much smaller image and it the other advantage that it
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:55.300]   has is that iMovie seems to do it seems to barely intelligently pull the when it when you make it 960
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:13:00.100]   by 540 what it's actually doing is grabbing one of the fields because it's interlaced and then scaling
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.100]   it horizontally which means that you're getting kind of a progressive scan you know a nice you know
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:08.660]   none of those little lines when everybody's moving quickly right so all of that goes away when you
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:14.980]   go to the 960 by 540 and iTunes and so you get a really nice clean image at 960 by 540 and this
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:21.220]   is a great camera I am impressed I like most is that I think it's the ultimate capture device in
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.980]   general where if you need to have something in your bag so that if you want to record some audio
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.740]   if you want to record some great video if you want to take still pictures right you have something
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:33.700]   in your bag that can do that yeah if I were taking a long trip I would definitely have this in my bag
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.940]   yeah and we'll talk more about it next week but but I just have to say I've been I've only had it
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.460]   for about a week now but I've been very impressed with it really it's been arched for three weeks
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.780]   and we can't believe how good oh you have one too everybody's got well you know they were pimping
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.500]   this stuff all over the product announcement right right I held out for the five I don't know
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:55.700]   if it's better or not the low light's grainy but not not awful uh certainly usable and I have to
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:01.780]   it's just and it's and boy is it a nice form factor Merlin man time for your pick my friend
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:07.380]   okay you guys can choose as you know I'm still very high on cold medicine I have a still
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:11.940]   yeah I was referred to by a physician as a 100 year slanted infection
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:17.140]   minus infection only comes along every hundred years wow you can choose I have to you can choose
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.100]   either a website that's kind of interesting or a piece of hardware that's kind of interesting
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:28.660]   neither of which has anything to do with max I was I was hard where hardware hardware any
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:33.860]   hardware we all agree on hardware I bought a lens for my SLR camera that has changed my life
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:39.380]   ooh the lens that changed his life ladies and i got a cannon i got a cannon i'm going to read
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:45.380]   the whole thing here off Amazon got a cannon ef 50 millimeter f1.4 usm medium teles that i
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:52.020]   i've got a 50 millimeter lens and it's completely not assume it's a fixed focus lens it is it is
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:57.220]   it's the one thousand thousand right it's the medium it's the medium quality one there's one
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:01.380]   that's there's one you can get on the L it's not the L it's not the crazy but boy at one point
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:05.700]   four you're right Alex boy that makes a difference it's a bad thing if you're it litters the deal
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:10.340]   here okay so here was my complaint with getting an SLR or DSLR my problem was like i and i
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:14.100]   Scott and i had a conversation a good conversation about this at his office it drives me crazy that
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:19.220]   i'm trying to learn like five different things at one time right if i run it on m you know manual
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.580]   setting i'm gonna be i've got to be learning all of these different things at one time
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.900]   and so generally i've been a P-man i leave it in you know pretty much
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.380]   P-man too in fact i'll be right there that's fine
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:38.340]   that's that's what you get at the girls with shoe horn sight uh the uh the beauty of this guy is
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:41.860]   so you here's the deal my friend Chris Glass told me about this lens you pop this thing on your
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:47.860]   camera you put it in P and you just get really good at framing stuff it is just it's a fantastic
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:52.420]   so basically the short version is that this particular lens and i'm gonna talk out of my butt
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.540]   and so one of you guys corrects me because you all know more about cameras than me
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.700]   but it's pretty close to the way like your human the human eye sees something in terms of
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:04.660]   depth of field and you just point this thing at stuff and shoot it's a suit it's really fast
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:09.460]   and and you can shoot in low light and it just takes great photos of like faces where everything
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:14.580]   in the background is really fuzzed out it's just a totally brain dead lens that teaches you how to
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:20.420]   just get better at framing shots uh and i love it it's my photos have gotten 20 times better i'm sure
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:24.660]   that's got your hand you can go ahead i was i was just gonna say not just that but it's just a very
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:30.340]   very fast lens it will give you solutions that you will not have otherwise uh my my beloved one of
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:35.940]   my beloved nieces uh took up hockey last last season and mine there's no way in hell you can
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:43.060]   really shoot a sport that is really really fast that takes place in a dark dark auditorium against
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:49.780]   a huge white sheet of of whatever uh unless you have a really fast lens like a 1.4 or 1.8 and
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:53.860]   your choice is you can either spend a thousand dollars on a proper sport zoom or you can spend
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:59.780]   100-150 dollars the mine is a night comp it's the same principle uh on a very very affordable f1.4
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:05.700]   f1.8 lens it is an essential it should be after you buy an accessory flash for your SLR that should
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:11.780]   be the third the second major purchase you make after that and i like i don't own a flash you know
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:16.420]   for i don't i in fact i i realized that after having my cannon for two years that the flash in
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:20.900]   it doesn't actually work because i you know i have this i hate the flash look you know in general
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.540]   when i'm taking pictures and mostly what i take pictures of are people and the the reason that i
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:30.740]   can do that all the time i mean even in the evening because you know or almost at night is um i you
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:35.380]   know i'll just turn the ISO up and and um and you know the other thing you can do is instead of
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:40.260]   putting in program you can also put an aperture priority and set it to that's that tv or which
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:45.060]   one is that a it's a avi okay so if you put an aperture priority what what it means is i'm
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:49.060]   going to give you the aperture and you you make a shutter speed that that makes that work you know
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:54.180]   so so now i'm going to turn it all the way to 1.4 and what that's going to give me is razor thin
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:58.180]   depth of field which means that literally if i focus on someone's eyes they're the front of their
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:05.060]   nose maybe out of focus i mean it's really really thin but you get these really lush if like any
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.180]   time i go somewhere where there's a lot of people and i want to shoot a lot of pictures of people
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:12.820]   that look like a magazine shot you know look like a great you know that classic look i'm just going
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:18.020]   to set it to you know set it to a 1.4 if i shoot a lot fast i'll set it to 1.4 i'll set it to aperture
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:23.380]   priority um i usually set it to all manual but it's a great way to start and you'll get these really
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:27.300]   you know the whole background is completely out of focus you know and it looks really focused and
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:31.620]   it looks really classic and and you can really just take you can almost i mean i hate to use this
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:35.860]   term because it's the wrong it implies the wrong thing but i wanted something where i could start
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:40.340]   taking snap shots and by that i mean i want to focus completely on what's in the shot rather than
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:45.460]   thinking about you know kind of how i'm taking it and and you know i want to get to a point where
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:49.860]   then i can eventually get a little more scott born like in my control of the image but at first i
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.740]   want to get better at shooting and this but what do people call this where you know that you do
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:57.700]   the zoom with your feet with this you just you you walk closer to you or further from something
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:01.700]   and it's just great for snap shots it's so fast and you always capture the moment i'm curious what
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.780]   scott thinks i just got you probably got the bajillion dollar version of this right i have the 1.2 which
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:11.460]   is a little faster but yeah it's a it's a nice lens and and the reason it's working for you maryland
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:16.420]   is the wider the aperture the more blurred out the background and it helps you to focus on the
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:20.340]   foreground subject and that blurriness and the background is real pretty on this lens that's known
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:25.780]   as the bokeh the bokeh of the lens how do you spell that uh it's japanese words i'm not sure
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:33.060]   and and the bokeh on this lens is very nice for the money it's a great lens you're right it does
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:37.460]   sort of approximate the standard view of the human eye that's a little bit
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:43.860]   magnified by virtue the camera using having a 1.3 sensor but it's still close enough to be good
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:47.860]   and uh it's really good point is there's you can go either way on these this is apparently the
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.100]   middle of three i've got the one that was uh four one hundred seven alics but you can also get one
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:56.340]   that's like eighty bucks uh and there's then there's of course the high end one but this one's a little
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:01.700]   heavier it feels more solid it's it's not plastic uh but people but the reviews i read i was actually
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:08.740]   pretty close the the eighty dollar version of this is which is a 1.8 i believe is uh it's a 1.8
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:15.380]   fantastic they offer a 1.8 a 1.4 to 1.2 there was a 1.0 anyway we're getting out but there was a
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:19.620]   1.0 but this is all i'm saying is if you if you are out there and you look at photos on flicker uh
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:23.940]   and you go gosh i wish my photos look more like that and you've got an s l r the very first thing to
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:30.100]   do is take off that stupid telephoto and and buy a decent lens uh and it's and i did i
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:34.580]   i bought a cheap one yeah exactly and i'll tell you i did buy a flash just because i want to start
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:40.100]   experimenting with uh i got it one of those whatever the speed light flashes but you're right i mean
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.780]   this is this would be the first thing you should buy after you get an s l r is consider one of these
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:49.060]   lenses and apparently these used to be the lenses that shift on most cameras in the days before
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:53.220]   is that correct and so that's why you could look at so many awesome old photos and look great
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.700]   instead of like you know the first day the first thing you want to do is start zooming in on everything
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.660]   with a telephoto which is about the last thing you need to use telephoto used to be kind of people
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:07.380]   used to hate telephoto everybody would get a fixed focus lens yeah fixed focal length lenses
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.420]   are always sharper than telephoto and still even today they're modern not a mac thing
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:17.540]   because in a zoom lens not a telephoto i'm sorry i'm sorry zoom lenses zoom sorry but uh yeah this
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:20.660]   is totally on mac like but i know you guys are camera geek so i thought you'd dig that and
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:27.220]   you can use a mac process the photos there you go i totally do and i use acorn oh yeah love that
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.340]   acorn by the way i think that isn't pixel mader coming out now and its final release
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:36.740]   that's up to you it's one point out today yeah that should be our pick well we made it a pick in the
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:42.580]   past but uh so now you can get pixel mader and uh see for yourself how good it is it should have
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:50.420]   been my pick it's really cool nabot oh well we make it a universal pick all four of us pick it yay
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:56.980]   it's good stuff we're we we're at a time in fact this has been another lengthy edition
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.740]   but that's because those picks just go on and on but we love the picks so we're going to keep doing

[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:34.500]   designed by my friend chris glass the guy who the guy who told me about the lens stuff and uh i
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:40.980]   love it a lot and uh you now have uh a job board too which is kind of cool job board i got i'm
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:46.180]   starting to get guest contributors allowing some friends of mine to write stuff and the maryland
