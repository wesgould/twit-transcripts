[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.040]   that covers your Macintosh news, Apple news,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.880]   in great obsessive detail.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.280]   And who better to obsess about these things
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760]   than Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.520]   and the celestial waste of bandwidth?
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.760]   Are you getting an eye exam, Andy?
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.800]   No, I'm actually giving eye exams here.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.560]   The HMO situation is so overblown here in New England
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.440]   that you can get a $10 code pay for just about anything.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.520]   So Marchman here after the show,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   going to look into that thing, Scribble, Scribble, Scribble
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.480]   on a notepad I got at Office Max.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.720]   Boom, $10.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.360]   We've solved that in California.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   We give marijuana licenses for that.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.480]   It really works great.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.000]   I remember the olden days when he just used to put on a pair
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   of these we couldn't read.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.320]   Now you just smoke enough dope.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.520]   You don't even care about what you're going to see in the car.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.880]   You don't have any more.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.360]   That's Alex Lindsay to my right from the PixelcorePixelcore.com.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.680]   Of course, P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.TV for their podcasts.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.360]   Good to see you in studio.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.520]   And we are going to use the question tree again this week.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.240]   So pixelcore.force.com/pixelcore.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.840]   We are going to eventually get around to it.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.480]   It looks like we're going to start using this over and over again.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   So we'll get a better URL.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.200]   We apologize.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.520]   Well, I don't-- yeah, we should just get questions that--
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.880]   We can--
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   You know what?
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   We can--
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.800]   We can actually get our sys admins on that this week
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.880]   and have them questions.twit.tv.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.800]   And then it just bounces.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   And that would just bounce.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.720]   So anyway, if you have questions, what you can do there,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.000]   which is kind of nifty.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   If you go to pixelcore.force.com/pixelcore,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   you can ask questions.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.080]   As many of you did last week, I think
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.280]   we had 120 questions.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.780]   Great.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.520]   And then just phone them up.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.280]   Because we'll answer the top voted.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.480]   Right.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.320]   So the thing is that vote them up and down.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.200]   So the ones you don't want to have answered, vote them down.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.160]   For the ones that you do want to have answered, vote them up.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.000]   And that really makes it easy for us to figure out what most of you
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.320]   want us to answer near the end of the show.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.000]   So jump on it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   And all of you--
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.720]   We are your trained monkeys here.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.240]   Remember that.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.480]   We are your trained monkeys.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.840]   Our job to just--
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.240]   Just to dance.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.040]   Just call the two.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.640]   Jump monkey jump.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.840]   Also here, Mr. Leander Connie from the cultofmac.com site,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.920]   cultofmac.com.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.360]   And I'm great to have you, Leander, because you've got an interview.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.600]   First of all, you are quoted in the book,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.520]   but also you've got an interview with Walter Isaacson.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.640]   So you returned the favor.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.520]   So we will ask you about that a little bit.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.800]   I just wanted to say that it's too bad there's nothing good to read this week.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.640]   Holy cow.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.440]   This is--
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.160]   How many 600 pages the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs rushed out?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.680]   I thought I was going to listen to it.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.560]   And then I downloaded it.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.080]   And it was 22 hours before the show.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.600]   It was 25 hours long on Audible.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.720]   And yeah, it's like OK.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.200]   I ended up buying all the copies.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.960]   So I have two copies of the hardcover from Amazon.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.280]   I have iBooks version, which is quite nice by the way.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.040]   It's the first book I've really read on iBook.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.480]   I thought-- I should read it on the iPad, right?
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.000]   I got the Kindle version, which seems so barren,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.400]   especially because there's lots of pictures in it.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.080]   And then the audiobook version is quite good.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   Although if you want to get through with something fast,
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.520]   the audio is probably not the way to do it.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   Andy, have you finished the book?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.120]   I'm only about a quarter of the way through it.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.920]   Yeah, I'm about a third of it.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.320]   And part of it is just being slowed down by all the really great bits inside it.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.400]   I mean, it really was a very open interview.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   If you think-- it's a very open book.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.880]   And when you don't get about four or five pages in before,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   you start to see a lot of the real truth behind it.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.400]   There really is no myth-making here.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.920]   It's all about making sure you understand exactly who Steve Jobs
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   was, good and bad, and very bad sometimes.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.680]   Yeah, I mean, I would agree with that.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.800]   Leander, did you have an advanced copy?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.320]   Were you able to read it before we got it?
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.840]   I got it on Amazon the night before.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.040]   So they sent me a copy and it showed up here first thing yesterday morning.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.200]   But I managed to get it through Kindle on Sunday night.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.000]   And I started reading it on my iPad in bed.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.360]   And yeah, it's a remarkable achievement.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.920]   But it's a personal read.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.560]   It's not a fun read?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.520]   I don't think so.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   No, I thought it was--
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.360]   I became quite depressed yesterday, really.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.480]   I did too.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.320]   And I'm just curious what depressed you about this.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   Well, he was such a difficult man.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.520]   He was such a taskmaster.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.200]   And it really is just sort of a catalog of very bad behavior.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.000]   Although you can't gain say, the results--
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.400]   Right.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   I'm up to through the Pixar part.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   But what struck me in the part I've read so far was the Mac team.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Now, most of the stuff up to this point we know pretty well.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840]   There's no real revelations or not any major ones anyway in the first three
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.680]   of the book.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.960]   But you still really-- I was struck by the fact that the Mac wouldn't exist
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.760]   without Steve just relentlessly dogging that team.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.240]   Right.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.920]   As Johnny I said, he had a great tribute to Jobs
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   at the Celebrating Steve's event at Apple last week.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.480]   And he said that we all paid a price for these products.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.080]   But Steve paid the highest price.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.920]   He cared the most.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.120]   And that clearly comes through here.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.080]   I mean, it's an enormous effort on his part.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.520]   I mean, huge drive.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.040]   And I don't know if it really illuminates it really so.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.920]   I don't know if I really understood what pushed him so hard.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.720]   Yeah, there's a lot of pseudo-psychology at the beginning saying,
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.600]   because Steve was abandoned by his birth parents,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.880]   that that wound never healed, that he, in fact, abandoned Lisa, his first daughter,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.600]   at the same age that his father had abandoned him, 23,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.520]   and that he was always looking for a father figure,
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.960]   hence Arthur Rock and John Scully, and a succession of father figures.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.480]   That's Pop's psychology.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.400]   I don't know if you can--
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.560]   And Jobs himself denied it.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.960]   He says, that's overblown.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.360]   I mean, a lot of people, a lot of psychologists say,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.960]   if you want a person to be successful oftentimes
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.400]   removing the father figure early is regardless of whether they--
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.160]   That gives them some drive, huh?
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.440]   Because they're basically running up against something they can't compare.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.040]   Well, well, in the inner city.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.520]   Well, yeah, so the--
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.040]   I mean, there's a lot of other components to that,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.160]   but there's a lot of people that when they can't compare themselves to someone,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.320]   you know, they just keep on driving.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.720]   And yet, you know, his adopted father, Paul Jobs, was very influential, clearly.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.520]   Or you can see the kind of stuff in the book where they're talking about him--
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   Perfectionism.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   Teaching him to make the back of the fence as beautiful as the front of the fence,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.200]   even though no one's going to see it.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.280]   You can see early on, you start adding that level.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   Although, I got to say, going a little farther,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.200]   there's two anecdotes in here about painting the machinery in both the Macintosh
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.840]   and the next cube factory were fully automated.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.040]   And Jobs insisted and spent hours agonizing over the colors
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.880]   that the machinery should be painted.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.560]   Finally said, "I want white walls, Debbie Coleman, who is running the Macintosh factory."
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.600]   So you can't have white walls in a white museum, white walls,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.000]   and a factory said, "Yes, you can, and we're going to."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And they painted the walls white.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.720]   He brought his dad in, he would go in with gloves, military style, and inspect for dust.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.240]   They proudly brought his dad in to see all the machines.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.080]   There's one machine that they didn't like the shade of blue.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.960]   It was painted.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.640]   One of the robots that built the Mac.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.760]   So he painted it blue against all the engineers advice.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.520]   You can't repaint it once it started.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.320]   It never worked right.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.480]   They named it Steve's folly.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.560]   And not far from learning from that, he did the same thing with the next factory.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.520]   Of course, the next factory wasn't so critical because it was built to make 10,000.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.320]   Next cubes a month and only had to make 400 a month.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.200]   So they really only had it on one day a month.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.160]   He was obsessive about details that probably he didn't need to obsess about.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.480]   You know, I mean, it's not just the back of the fence.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.040]   But I think that it's always the whole picture.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   Being obsessive about details doesn't mean you're always right about those details.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.600]   That obsessiveness is also what got us these computers.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.480]   Well, I agree.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   And so it's spread out over everything.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.160]   And sometimes it, most of the time it looks like it hit pretty well.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.520]   And definitely there are a lot of examples in here where it didn't.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   But I think it's a state of mind that is hard to turn off.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.400]   Right.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.840]   And luckily he had a great team to bounce ideas off because it's clear that the people around
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.400]   and the people that he chose to work with were so important to keeping his wacko ideas in check.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.600]   And I think he had as many wacko ideas as he had good ideas.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.360]   I mean, he obviously had great instincts, but you know, he would suggest some crazy stuff.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.680]   The robot being a good example.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.240]   And you know, they were debate stuff a lot.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.040]   You know, I thought it was interesting about while they were trying to,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.800]   the iPod was taken off, but it never really took off until they took it to Windows.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.000]   And this is something that he sort of fought to his dying day.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.880]   They fought about this for six months every week, you know, meeting after meeting,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   fighting, fighting, fighting. And in the end, he was, you know, he just said, okay,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.600]   get you all's go and do what you want.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.640]   And in the long run, it turns, it seems from this book that and the Mac team is the one
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.320]   where it really seems to have worked, at least so far.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.840]   I haven't gotten to the later years, but you know, he hasn't returned to Apple in the,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   in the S yet, but the Mac team is an example of where he would, if you fought back,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.280]   he would respect you. And he was his position. I thought this is not such a
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.560]   incorrect position that if you want to make a good team, you can't have B and C quality players.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.280]   A players want to work with a players. And he said, I'm chasing, by being such a jerk,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.240]   I'm placing on chasing off the B and C players.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.840]   It was like giving that much credit because, again, I too remember of the haven't made it
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.920]   all through the book club, but you get the impression that I've met people like that who are, who
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.080]   are used that as a legitimate tactic saying that, look, if you're not willing to fight for your
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.560]   position, you must not believe it very strongly anyway. And so you're just not much used to.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   So there's, I believe that there was, from that and also stories,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.400]   stories I've been told by people who like worked with Steve a lot, that there was that component
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.600]   to it. But a lot of it was just that he just didn't care about your feelings. He just did,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.160]   there are really good managers who have a way of saying, well, we're obviously not on the same
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.480]   page. This may not be the sort of company where we can work together to your fullest.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   And maybe we should start looking at things like that. He'd be like, okay, you're an idiot,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.120]   you're an ass. Why are you doing here? Why are you wasting everybody's time? That was
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.000]   totally unnecessary. You know, the other thing that struck me on this book is there's a lot of
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.600]   tears. Steve cries at the drop of a hat in this book. And not only Steve, but it's John Scully
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.280]   burst into tears at one point. People are crying a lot in this book.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:12.800]   I think one of the, to talk about what Andy was talking about, the, I think one of the
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.280]   complicated things to do great things is that you have to have people do things that are bigger
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.600]   than themselves, that are more than what they were going to do without you being there.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.720]   And I think that there's this crazy balancing act between having the empathy to understand
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.160]   where they're coming from and where they are, you know, as far as they haven't slept for four,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.000]   you know, for four days or whatever. And also having the lack of empathy to be committed to,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.960]   you know, completing a mission. Well, here's an example. They talk about in the book, Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.080]   And all the Mac team in order to get the Mac software working for the demo, you know,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.600]   the one where he says he comes out of the, actually it was before the demos for shipping
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.520]   to ship day. They had to stay up three nights straight. Barrell Smith or one of them brought a
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.480]   big bag of espresso coffee beans and they just were eating chocolate espresso coffee beans for
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.040]   three days straight. They finally, they're done. Hertzfeld's like on the couch, comatose, goes home.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.040]   They all come back a few hours later. They plan to spend, you know, sleep forever, but they come
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.920]   back a few days that are see how the thing's doing. Jobs says, oh, by the way, I need a really cool
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.600]   demo. That's the one where they write where the hello, I'm not going to touch. It's good to get out
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.720]   of the bag. They had to write that demo. So they go, okay. So finally, Hertzfeld, it's done.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.960]   He takes, he takes a leave of absence. Jobs distributes stock options at that point and doesn't give
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.480]   Hertzfeld any. And Andy comes in and says, what the hell? He says, well, people on, he actually
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.520]   asked his boss, not Steve. Well, what the hell? Boss says, oh, well, nobody who was on leave got
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.720]   options. He says, well, wait a minute. Wasn't on Lee. I was exhausted. I wasn't on Lee. I mean,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.080]   he had to fight for it. It wasn't an option. It was $50,000 a bonus. He had a fight for his
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.720]   $50,000 bonus. He finally got it. But that's the kind of thing jobs would do. He would push
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.680]   people to the edge of exhaustion and past it and then move on. It's like, okay, what have you done
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.120]   for me lately? There's a really cool line from one of his first girlfriends who said,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.280]   he was an enlightened being who was cruel. That's a really strange combination.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.920]   But you got to talk to Walter Isaacson. He interviewed you for the book because you're quoted in it,
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.760]   right? Yeah, he took a quote from a book and he listed inside Steve's brain and the bibliography.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:32.400]   So he looked at that. He sent me a really nice note saying that he'd read the books and looked
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.040]   at the website and they were all really useful. It's obvious that Isaacson did his homework here.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.200]   He's a former editor of Time Magazine. He knows what he's doing. He's written several very good
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.760]   biographies, including the Einstein, which is excellent. So you talked to him yesterday or the
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.520]   day before? Yesterday. Well, he was trying to get some lunch and check out of his hotel. He's on a
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:01.920]   media tour in New York. So we squeezed in a 20-25-minute phone call. Well, he was clearly a bit punchy
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.000]   because his blood sugar was low. Poor guy. And yeah, he's been doing the 60 minutes in if you
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.320]   had aired just the night before. And he's busy like crazy this week. So what did you glean from
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:20.800]   your conversation yesterday? He wanted to tell a little more detail about jobs. The big thing from
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.560]   60 minutes was that jobs delayed his cancer treatment. He delayed getting it removed anyway
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:33.120]   for nine months. And of course, this may have cost him his life. Instead, he was looking at
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.200]   alternative treatments. He didn't want his body to be violated, didn't want to be opened up and
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.360]   have part of his pancreas removed. So he tried herbal remedies and dietary remedies and a bunch
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.920]   of questions. Even a psychic apparently. Yeah. And that may have killed him because in fact,
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   many doctors think that that nine months was enough for it to metastasize. And it would have
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.120]   been treatable had he gotten operated on right away. Yeah, that looks to be the case. No one
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.800]   wants to say it. No one can know for sure, of course, because they might have spread it
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.760]   before. But yeah, they advised him to get it out straight away. And of course, his wife,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.200]   Andy Grove, who was a good friend of jobs and a cancer survivor, advised him to do that. Larry
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.240]   Ellison told him to go do it. Everybody basically was saying, get it out. And I asked Isaacson,
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.120]   how could somebody who's so rational, makes such what seems like such an irrational decision and
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.440]   such a unscientific decision? Here's the guy who's one of the leading technologists.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:34.720]   Why wouldn't he have a modern scientific based treatment? Well, Isaacson said that he was a
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.880]   lot more active in exploring all the different alternatives. And obviously, he was reluctant to
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.720]   get to get operated on. But I think it actually shows it. And Isaacson talks a lot about this,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.840]   that jobs trusted intuition more than rationality. Again and again, it says in this book, it was
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.800]   about intuition for him. That's what he learned when he was in India for a year. That's what he
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.160]   learned in his Zen studies. He really trusted his intuition, his gut. And that's where that,
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.960]   that sudden, you know, you would, he'd do code reviews. The person put the code on the table,
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.520]   he wouldn't even pick it up. Of course, Steve wasn't a coder, as Bill Gates points out kind of
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:18.880]   bitterly. But he wouldn't even pick it up. He'd say, that's crap. Make it better. And so he trusted
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.760]   this gut. And this in this case has got failed. And I think, well, one thing I will say is that we
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.880]   don't, we don't know what would have happened. Like his gut told him not to do it. We've got
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.360]   told him not to do it. We don't know what would have happened. Of course, we can, doctors can
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.560]   tell us that everything would have been fine if they had just done the operation. But you know,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.200]   my great grandfather died from a routine tonsylectomy. Right. So, I mean, you know, it could have been
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   something. Although this particular kind of cancer is highly apparently, and I'm not an expert,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.560]   highly operable, and it's a shame, I feel bad. You know, it's interesting. The other thing that
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.160]   comes through several times in the book is that Jobs was fairly fatalistic. He, he said he would
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.680]   die young. He, he believed that he told Scully, I'm going to die young. I need to do a lot right
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.280]   now. I need to accomplish a lot right now, because I'm not going to have many chances.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.720]   So, this might have been almost self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.600]   Yeah, it certainly was. He was obsessed with death. He was going on about in his 20s,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.040]   that he thought he was going to die before he was 30. He told Scully that he thought he was
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.840]   going to die before he was 30. And yeah, that obviously drove him a lot. You know, we were
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.640]   talking earlier about what drove him. And I think that fear of death definitely, definitely did,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.360]   definitely pushed him to try to make a mark. But yeah, and of course, you know, he died just
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.720]   sort of at the height of his powers. I mean, I think that's why we saw that huge. I love
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.120]   the shark. There was all the shark, you know, that all the memorials that showed up at the Apple
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.160]   stores when he died. You know, a lot of people felt that he was just really getting going. He was
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.440]   really just starting to get some respect too. Most of his career, you know, people thought he was
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   just a slick salesman, a marketer, a fast talker, you know, somebody who, who, who, whose reputation
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.520]   was built upon the work of others like Wozniak and Johnny Ive. And it was only, you know, I mean,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.760]   even up until the iPhone, I would say up until 2006, 2007, people thought he was like a one hit wonder.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.720]   The iPod was, you know, Apple getting lucky. The Mac was still had a niche market share.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.360]   You know, even though Apple was obviously on a firm footing, he wasn't being lauded in the,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.040]   in the, in the business mags. He wasn't a CEO to emulate everyone's,
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.640]   criticized his, his management technique and felt that there wasn't something that anybody
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.840]   else could learn from. So, well, in fact, his first go around at Apple, he kind of was a jerk.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.560]   I mean, he did make the Mac, but yeah, I haven't gotten to the second yet, but one of the things
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.200]   I said is it wasn't getting fired. It wasn't getting, is it really? Oh, geez, it wasn't getting
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.840]   fired that taught Steve. It was failing with next. Of course, while he's failing with next,
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.080]   he's taking this little company called Pixar, trying to convince the folks at Pixar that their
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.720]   business is selling hardware and software. But there's this guy, John Lasseter, says, well,
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.480]   hey, let me just make some demo films to show off what our software can do.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.680]   Wins an Academy Award. Steve Jobs funds this, by the way, out of his own pocket, because
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.120]   there's no money being made by Pixar at this point and spends $300,000 on the Tintoy.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.040]   And by the way, like Oscar, I think all, there are all of those shorts, all those early Pixar
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.440]   shorts are on iTunes. I have them all on my kids iPad. It started with little,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.880]   little Luxo, Luxo Jr. There's, and there's even, there's a lot of early ones that are very rough
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.800]   animation. And they were just 10 of what the Pixar hardware could do.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.320]   Well, and it's also, it was John Lasseter testing animation. I mean, of course,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.120]   that's what he told us the jobs, but of course, Lasseter came from animation,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.640]   but Lasseter's not interested in technology. He's interested in making movies.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.680]   After Tintoy, Disney came after him very hard saying, "We want you to make a movie about
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   toys, intelligent toys." And Lasseter was so loyal to Steve at this point. And this is,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.880]   this is the other side of that coin. Lasseter loved Steve Jobs so much at that point. He said,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.680]   no, I'm gonna stay at Pixar. You know, and eventually what happened is Disney made a deal with Pixar,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.000]   said, well, you know, let's do some movies. And well, you know what happened.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.920]   We're gonna take a break. Andy Inacos here, Lander Connie from Macalte, Mac, and of course,
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.280]   Alex Lindsey. We'll talk about more than the more than the book. I want to talk about the 60
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.120]   minutes because there was stuff I'd never seen before. I feel like we've seen every Steve Jobs
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.880]   clip there ever was. Until the 60 minutes. Until the 60 minutes. There's a little bit of a
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.280]   revelation. So we'll talk a little bit more about that and more about the book. And there's new Mac
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.560]   out, new Mac books. There's a new thermostat from the guy who did the iPod. There's lots to talk
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.440]   about. Let's, let's take a break though and tell you a little bit about go to meeting. You know,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.840]   I'm a big fan of go to meeting. We use it for all our meetings. I know I don't have to tell Alex,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   he uses it for all of his meetings. I was on one right before I got here. I love him. We do
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.440]   call, you know, this is one of the negatives about a growing business. We do more conference
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.720]   calls than we used to. Yeah, such a drag. Oh, yeah, yeah. But thank goodness for go to meeting because
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.680]   they're not just, you know, I'm on the phone. Go to meeting course, we started with screen
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.840]   sharing. So you could show the presentation at Mac or PC. It's completely cross-platform.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.920]   So you could have your keynote presentation and show it to everybody at the meeting and so forth.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.280]   But now they've got this HD faces thing, which is just really wonderful. Also cross-platform.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.040]   So you're looking at the screen sharing, the presentation, but you're also seeing high-def
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:12.400]   video of the attendees. And it just brings it to life. The quality is so good that, you know,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.160]   you really feel like you're at an in-person meeting. You can arrange it as you want. So you can see
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.840]   there that's three across the top, but you could also have six across the top, three on the side,
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.160]   three on the other side, you know, or you can go full screen. And I'll tell you, being able to see
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.560]   a client's body language while you're pitching them, being able to talk and bond with your co-workers,
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.400]   even if they're all over the world is just remarkable. It's so easy to set up, so easy to use. I want

[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.400]   Macs, I'm sure that's what he was using. They look fantastic. And by the way, this is really cool.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.760]   You can now attend a meeting on the iPad. We could do that for a while. They've got an iPhone
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.400]   client now and an Android client. So you could be in a men's room and be in a meeting. Don't use
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.280]   the video. Not such a good idea, but you could do it if you wanted to wear the airport or at home.

[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:43.040]   So I was it's funny. We had we were doing Twit with a couple of people from the East Coast on Sunday,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:49.440]   and they demanded to be released. Lance Ulanoff, who's the editor in chief of Mashable said,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.200]   "I have to be done by 7 p.m. Eastern time so you could watch 60 minutes."
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   Wow. And it was, then you couldn't Tivo it. In fact, it was online before it was on TV, but
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.080]   didn't you want to watch it with the feeling. In fact, I was so disappointed when it was like
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.560]   they started doing something else. I thought the whole show. I wanted more, didn't you?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.360]   I did, and I have to admit, I was like, I'm just going to record this, but before you
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.920]   knew it, it's having a clock. I was sitting down watching. I was sitting down watching.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.800]   Especially because there's so much audio right from Steve himself.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.560]   Yeah, that's something missing from the book is these interviews. You can hear them walking around
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.200]   and Steve's talking, and the quotes are in the book.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.400]   From a production versus perspective, I have to say that if I was interviewing Steve Jobs,
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.320]   I would have used better audio. Well, he didn't expect to have him on 60 minutes, I'm sure.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   I would have expected that.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.040]   Well, yeah, there's a moment where you hear Walter rustling his notebook,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.280]   because he's trying to write down what he's saying, but actually gave it a kind of reality.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.480]   And it's interesting because he had 40 interviews, right, Leander? I mean, he really had a lot of
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.040]   time, but the story goes that Jobs approached him at the Aspen Institute a few years ago
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.160]   and said, "Will you write my biography?" And Isaacson was writing the Einstein biography,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.840]   and he had just written a biography of Ben Franklin. He said, "Well, you really ought to be dead first."
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:08.640]   He said, "I think the way he put it is, it's been quite a roller coaster career. Can we wait
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:16.080]   till we, it evens out?" And what he didn't know was that Jobs was ill. It wasn't known at all.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.920]   Jobs kept on him. And finally, Lorraine, his wife, Steve Jobs' wife, called Isaacson and said,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.200]   "You know, you got to do this because Steve's sick, and this might be your only chance." And at that
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.560]   point, Isaacson sits down two years ago, and they do 40 interviews, including one in August,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:40.160]   just before Steve announced to the board that he was leaving Apple. And just, you know, like,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.400]   they would walk through Cupertino, they'd go to Homestead High, and he said, "Yeah, this is where
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.000]   the club met." It was just amazing stuff. These pictures of Steve's office and home,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.640]   really kind of simple. It's just this book is worth getting just for this, I have to say.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.000]   What were you surprised about, Andy, what did you, from that 60 Minutes piece?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.320]   I thought the money quote was just at the very, very end, where, and remember, these were all
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   casual interviews that Steve was doing with Isaacson. It's not like they're sitting down in front of a
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.200]   studio for broadcast. And so they're talking about, they're finally getting around to talking about
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.160]   death, and what does he believe in terms of does he believe in God, does he believe in an afterlife?
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.520]   And this is the actual audio that you're hearing in the 60 Minutes interview, where he's saying that
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:34.080]   Isaacson's actually recounting this, but saying that, well, it's sometimes I believe that
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.960]   there's some part of you that keeps going on, and that really makes you feel good. And I started to
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.040]   believe that a little bit more now that I'm facing the end, but there is also a part of me that worries
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:50.400]   that when you die, you die, that's it. You continue the cease to exist. It's like flipping a switch,
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   then there was a pause, and he said, I think that's why none of my, none of that, no Apple
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.440]   devices have an on/off switch. You really think that's why? Well, it's, when the more you read the
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.080]   book, the more you realize that he did have this sort of holistic approach to just about everything,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.360]   that things that he, things have been on his minds, and you get the impression, I'm sorry,
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.160]   from the book that things have been on his mind since he was 15, 16, 17, that continued to inform
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.840]   all of his decisions. And so I wish that we did have the audio so we could hear if there was a
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.760]   little inflection in his voice. I think there's a smile there. If he was joking about that, or,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.040]   no, or if that was literally truly, he just doesn't like the idea philosophically, you like the idea
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.840]   that you don't have an Apple device is always waiting for you to do something with it. And the
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.720]   moment you needed to do something, it's there for you. The idea that no, it's never off. It's just
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.560]   sort of in the wings for you. And you can imagine all the stories that are in this book. You can
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.480]   imagine him actually thinking that on some level and basically saying, no, there's no power switch.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.760]   Why would you ever turn off? Why would you ever want to turn off an iPad? It's wonderful.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.440]   The 60 Minutes piece ended with this picture of Steve in his office in his home. And, and
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.560]   Isaacson pointed out that he lived on a normal street. There were no fences, no gates, no security
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.200]   personnel. She wanted to have a normal life. And he said he could walk you just walk into his back
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.120]   garden. I mean, there was like, no, there's a layer that would slow you down.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.240]   That was really cool. Because he was talking about how he wanted to be in a neighborhood where his
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.920]   kids could like play with other kids and walk on this walk from place to place.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.440]   I share that, actually. I think that that's a, that's a, that's what you want. He did
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.360]   his first kids to some degree. Yeah. And also the idea that he wanted to make sure that he never
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.120]   wanted to live, excuse me, according to the book, he never really wanted to live in a world of
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.040]   billionaires. He wanted to live in the real world. Really. So that, that, that version of the real
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.160]   world, which is pretty important because when you, the, the idea of when you, a chain, when you
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.120]   achieve a certain level of wealth, it really does come down to you will only be shopping at the store
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.960]   in that neighborhood where other super rich people are. Your kids will only be going to the
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   schools where other super rich people are. You will be driven everywhere. You will never have to
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.520]   touch the filthy ground ever. And so that's really one of the many admirable things that you,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.640]   that we learned from the books.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.400]   Yeah. You know, I don't know about that. There was a lot of talk about him ripping off. And he
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.960]   hurts, felt and, you know, all of it. Daniel cocky. That was a terrible story. Oh, yeah. No,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.160]   absolutely. No, I know Dan pretty well. We've been into each other a lot. He spends half his time
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.600]   in, you know, in Hawaii. Yeah. I think I'm just saying a lot. I think he's one of the sweetest,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   kindest, nicest guys to this day that you would ever want to meet. And, and it's interesting,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.920]   both was and Daniel are very hesitant to say negative things about Steve Jobs, even though.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.400]   They got a little run over. They got really run over. Oh, yeah.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:45.680]   And in this book, was is more forthright than I've ever seen him about. Gee, I wouldn't have done
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.200]   it that way. I didn't really like how Steve was doing it. You know, he's nowadays, he's,
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.440]   it's very hard to get him to say anything negative about it. So it's, it's.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.920]   But Atlanta, I agree with you completely. I think what I like about the book, or at least the quarter
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:07.920]   that I've read so far is that it really does show both sides. And I'm, I think it's such a positive
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   thing that this is happening through almost the perfect point, which you would want this book to
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.880]   release be released because I think it's only appropriate after someone has died, whether it's
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.680]   a famous person or a family member, you spend a week or two really just thinking about all the
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.920]   good things about this person. And, but then you don't let you don't ever try to put this person
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.440]   up on a pedestal because he did this remarkable thing like dying. It's really important that,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.800]   that sort of thinking gets cut off before he becomes deified. I mean, it's, it's, for years,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.840]   where we all just sort of, oh, Steve Jobs, Parks and Handicap spaces. And he, you know, kind of sees
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.160]   he's screwed. He screwed was like, oh, that, oh, that Steve Jobs. And that can be sort of like,
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.320]   turned into like the folklore of always and he had a, he had a, he had a nayside. You wouldn't
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.440]   want to be on his bad side. I'm really glad that the full dimension of him is being documented by
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.040]   this book. Well, yeah, it's, it's so ironic that he says he wants to wage thermonuclear war against
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:08.480]   Android for stealing iPhone, wearing time after time after time from was from Xerox from everybody
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:14.400]   else. He's in fact, he even says good artists steal. He quotes Picasso. The one of the things I thought
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.960]   was interesting is I didn't realize that with the Xerox, they actually gave Xerox stock, I believe,
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   the Apple. There was a deal. It wasn't like they just took it. They actually, yeah, they wanted Xerox
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.240]   to invest into Apple. Apple needed money badly at the time. So what Jobs did is he kind of played
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:34.640]   the Xerox had a venture capital arm against the engineering arm. The engineers did not want to show
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.840]   what was going on with their GUI. They didn't want to show the mouse. But the, but Jobs was very
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:47.600]   clever as always brilliant businessman who said, Hey, I'm going to let you invest in Apple. I'm
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.800]   going to let you give us $20 million. But only on the one condition that you let me see what you're
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.240]   doing at park. And the investment arm, which is in the east coast said, yeah, yeah, yeah, park,
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.600]   show them everything. So app. So Steve shows up with Andy Hertzfeld and a bunch of others.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.360]   Larry Tesla is showing his working for Xerox, Parkie later went to work for Apple.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.680]   And next, I believe. But anyway, Larry Tesla is showing him just basic stuff.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.520]   And and Hertzfeld, who's read all of the papers said, this isn't this. They're not shown to say
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.720]   anything. We don't know. And Steve starts yelling at him saying, I want to see more. And he calls
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.200]   the venture army says they're not showing me he took two or three meetings where they finally
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.600]   got to really peek in behind the command. So he's very clever. They didn't I always thought they
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.760]   licensed it. That was kind of the story. They didn't license it. They gave Xerox the right to
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:44.240]   give them money. Well done. Clever. Well played. So I mean, but there's time and time again where
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.880]   jobs is just a I would hate to have to negotiate against Steve Jobs. I totally count.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:55.200]   You mean enough people. Of course, you talk to people who were in in some of these meetings.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:01.280]   He was in a meeting with a software company that were made unnamed. And he just the conversation
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:08.240]   began with, you guys are F'd. You're F'd. You're F'd. Your entire business model is F'd. You know,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.080]   like, you know, you guys have no idea which way which way the sun is or which way the sky is.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.800]   You know, it just is long drawn out. And then that was you got to get that was the first words that
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   came into out of his mouth when he walked into the room just to kind of set the tone. So Apple's
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.480]   looking for a second round of financing. It's 1979. They're really running out of money.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.880]   Jobs says, quote, I will let you invest a million dollars in Apple. If you'll open the
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.920]   kimono at park, that's a hundred thousand shares, 10 bucks each. Park agreed. And by the way,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.280]   that was a good investment because when Apple went public a year later, that one million dollars
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.120]   worth 17.6 million dollars more money than they made ever made with that technology again. Yeah.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.520]   Yeah. So there's one there's two briefers. There's Larry Tesla and there's a woman named Adele
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   Goldberg. She was appalled that her company seemed willing to give away its crown jewels.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:01.200]   It was incredibly stupid, completely nuts. And I fought to prevent jobs from giving much of
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:08.720]   anything or giving jobs much of anything. And, and, you know, it's really, it's really a great story.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.920]   And, and I think this is one where we'd, we heard a lot of anecdotal stuff. This obviously is what
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.680]   really happened. I've even talked to Larry Tesla and he didn't tell me this. So Walter
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.440]   Isaacson did, I think a very good job of researching this book. And finally,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.560]   Jobs says, you're sitting on a gold mine. I can't believe Xerox is not taking advantage of this.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.880]   Yeah. Well, see, that's really the point. I mean, if, if Xerox had never shown that technology to,
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.040]   to Apple, would they have actually developed it into something like the Macintosh or would they have
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.160]   said, look, look, look at this immensely, really wonderful photocopier we've now made.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.680]   It's not a document storage center that people can walk up to and press M11 buttons and get a
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.320]   copy of something that they that was photocopy just yesterday, but no longer than three days
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.800]   will go, because let's not be nuts. I'm not convinced that they would have really seen the
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.520]   potential of this as a desktop operating system. They would have always thought in terms of
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.320]   photocopiers. Right. That's what Jobs said. He said they were copy of heads. Yes, that's what he
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:14.560]   called them. But you know, the thing that I think is, is really difficult to grasp is, is the,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:22.000]   the extent of his ambitions, you know, what huge ambitions he had, you know, he wanted to be
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.760]   a historical figure. He wanted to do something that really put it down the universe. And, you know,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.960]   coming up, we're going to be talking about Tony Fadel, who was one of his lieutenants. I mean,
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.160]   his latest venture is to make a thermometer. Yeah. A smart thermometer. And okay, you know,
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.640]   it might be a worthy product. It might be a very cool product. It looks very cool. It looks really
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.080]   nice. It looks really nicely made in design. But where's the ambition? You know, this is not one
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:54.560]   of sort of jobs-y and type projects. Well, they're TV. Well, no, but even the iPod, the iPod seemed
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:01.200]   like a fairly, it seemed like a fairly- Prose-y. Pumble product. But you know, jobs, I think,
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.640]   realized when he took, when he looked back at the interviews that he, when he's talking about the
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:11.760]   iPod, he doesn't, he talks about music and about music is something that is universal. It's in all
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.720]   of our lives. And, you know, this is where I think that kind of ambition comes from, you know,
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.320]   realizing that, that it's, it's about music. It's about something that's universally human.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.000]   And nobody has this kind of vision. You know, this is why Jobs was, this is why the Xerox thing
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.600]   is such a good example. People accuse him of taking their ideas, but they, they and nobody else
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.960]   surrounded with that project who saw that project saw its potential. He was one of the only one who
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.240]   thought this is the universal computing interface. Well, and I think a lot of it should bring it to,
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.440]   you know, it's everybody. Yeah. And I think a lot of people, you know, they say a lot of great
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.960]   inventions come from a complaint, like they start with a scratching and you know, that there's
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.520]   something there and he just had a lot of complaints and a lot of really good, really itchy. It turned
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.400]   out that his complaints were very close to what a lot of us, a lot of a lot of other people wanted
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.440]   as well. I mean, I had the same, I remember when the, I had not gotten an MP3 player, you know,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.280]   frustrated with, you know, trying to get one to work and so on and so forth. And even when the,
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.960]   when the iPod came out, I was like, Oh, that's too expensive. I'm not buying that. You know,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.720]   and so then I started looking for cheaper ones and trying to figure it out. And, and before I knew
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.680]   it, I finally bought one because I couldn't find anything. That's a really good point, Andy.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.200]   Alex, I mean, so, you know, a lot of the products that he did came from looking at products that
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.840]   sucked, computer sucked. And then he came up with a Mac, MP3 player sucked and he came up with the
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.240]   iPod cell phone sucked and he came up with the iPhone. It had a lot to do with, you know, scratching
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.840]   those issues. I mean, before the iPhone, we, I mean, I remember talking to friends, we'd always say,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.880]   you know, I hate my, I hate my cell phone. I just hate all the other ones more. Right. You know,
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.280]   and, and you know, when I had my trio, I just, I would swear at my trio constantly, but I hated,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.640]   but the other ones I just hated more than, you know, and when I got the iPhone, it was the first one
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.480]   that I enjoy, you know, you know, the truth is in the chatroom. And this is one thing that I really
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:01.440]   got out of this and watching the, the Wednesday tribute to Steve Jobs, we, you know, Steve
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.200]   was willing to take credit for everything. And in fact, this bugged Johnny Ive a little bit
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.800]   from time to time. He was kind of, you know, Hey, I thought that up. And de-drucing in the
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.600]   chatroom, let's not forget that there were really, really great people like Bill Atkinson,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.920]   like Andy Hertzfeld, like Johnny Ive, in every case who actually invented this stuff.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.760]   Well, I think I think they were driven by jobs, but they were the horses.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.920]   Well, I think that in the same way that Steve was able to see a good idea, I'm totally clear,
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.240]   he was also able to see great people, like see people that were able to do things, you know,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.920]   that are, you know, I don't think, you know, I don't think you survived if you were not great.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.200]   So I think the people that working closely closely to them are all probably, you know, best in the
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.360]   world. Yeah. Well, it reminds me of some of these stories remind me of stories that I hear
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:51.280]   about actors who have worked with James Cameron on sets, where they will,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:58.880]   whether it was like in the mid 80s or all the way up to Avatar, that will, the interview will
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.360]   cover the same two bases with this actor. Number one, this is some of the greatest work I have
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.560]   ever done. He pushed me to my limits and beyond. I was able to do things I never, ever, ever thought
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.400]   I was able to do. And this is one of the most tremendously proud things I've ever done,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.880]   this movie that I've done with James Cameron. The number two, I'll never, I never want to work
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.000]   with him again, because it was such a horrible experience. And I keep thinking about all the
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   different projects that could have been done by these people, if they had wanted to stick around,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.200]   if the burnout rate had not been so bad, if the cost of having regular interaction with a boss like
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:39.680]   that weren't so high to them. And it's possible that all these engineers would have never had had a
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.040]   hand in such absolutely world changing products. But maybe they would have been even happier saying,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.520]   well, I made a thermostat and it's a profitable company. It put a lot of people in business.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.120]   It's saving a lot of energy and the people who use it are very, very happy with it. It's too bad
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.920]   that I didn't, I wasn't one of those persons who made that device that totally changed the world,
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.000]   but I'm pretty perfectly happy having my sanity, having my blood pressure right where it should be,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.360]   and only making a thermostat. I just don't know if there's enough.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.600]   There are people like that, by the way, there are quite a few people.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.960]   There are people like that. I left Apple. Yeah, yeah. But I will say that as someone who runs,
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.440]   you know, runs a company and also works in production, there is a level of urgency that
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:23.600]   sometimes is required that being nice doesn't do it. You know, and I'd love to say that I can,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.080]   you know, that I could be nice all the time. And as unfortunately, some people here at Twit have heard,
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.000]   you're pretty harsh. We can hear you shouting all the way over on this side.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.160]   I think that's why that's why what people say is you apologize. I'm just like, I kind of
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.920]   under I have to say reading this book makes me think I really ought to be a bigger dick to my staff.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:48.480]   I really enjoyed it. I don't know if you've got a chance to watch the video. It's now posted on
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:55.040]   on Apple's site from the Wednesday celebration of cheese Steve Jobs life.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.120]   Tim Cook spoke Bill Campbell, who's on the Apple board and was with Apple in the
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.880]   early days, actually came back to Apple when Steve came back. And then this is Johnny I've
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.160]   speaking. And one of the things Tim Cook said, which I thought was really great was we had talked
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:17.040]   about this, I think, that Apple could be paralyzed by this need to ask what would Steve do going
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.960]   forward. It's what really hurt Disney when Walt Disney died, the company. In fact,
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.800]   Tim Cook brought this up. He said, Steve Jobs pointed this out that this really hurt Disney.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.720]   They would say, what would Walt do instead of coming up with their own ideas and it's jobs said,
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:37.520]   don't do that. Don't ask what would I do? Do your own great things. And I've been one of the
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.000]   naysayers who says, who's been saying that I don't think Apple can continue without Steve Jobs.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.440]   And I have to say watching this video and reading this book have inspired me that maybe
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.800]   that's not the case. I think in a lot of ways, there's a lot of places that Apple could really
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.560]   thrive. And there's great people there like Johnny I've in fact, Steve was a designer first and
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.400]   foremost. I don't know what Johnny's personality is, but this is the kind of guy you need to run
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.160]   Apple or at least have the vision. And that's one thing that Walter Isaacson points out in this
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   book is that the only person with more power at Apple than Steve Jobs was Johnny I've. Nobody
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.080]   could say anything to John. He doesn't need to do the product presentations. If you watch the video,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.320]   he's good. You can say he's got huge charisma. Yeah, he was funny and touching.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:29.040]   I mean, because Tim Cook, oh my God, he's very passionate. He was at the Apple store during the
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.520]   Apple the iPhone, I think for lunch. And he was just there to see how yeah, or I guess the iPad
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.920]   I'm sorry, the iPad launch. And he was just there to see, you know, how what just watch this.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.120]   If there's anybody more secretive than Steve Jobs, it's Johnny I've. And I don't know if you
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   learn that from Steve, they've worked together for 15 years. I think this might this guy might
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:54.160]   be the spiritual successor really to the Steve Jobs vision. I think he's really quite brilliant.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.200]   Do watch this video. It's about an hour and 10 minutes. Nora Jones is amazing in it.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:05.520]   I have to admit, when she sings Bob Dylan's Forever Young, I just burst into tears. See,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:12.400]   even this book causes crying. And then, and then Coldplay performs a set at the end,
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.320]   which is kind of interesting. Did you when they when they did this event, you remember they
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.920]   closed all the Apple stores all around the world. They put up curtains on the windows.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:28.240]   And I thought, this is kind of typical Apple, right? You know, they made this event secret when
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.960]   they should have made it public. There was no public memorial, was there? Right, but this
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.480]   could have been the public. Right, it would have been an amazing thing to have opened the stores and
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.200]   have a big well, they've made it public now. You can watch it, certainly. But I think right, but
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.800]   on your own, you know, but people were going down to the stores, they were laying memorials,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.320]   they were putting flowers and posted, no, so the windows. What if Apple had opened the doors
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.720]   to these stores where they normally invite people to go shop and said,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.160]   this is our public memorial to Steve. Come on in and, you know, see what we're, see what we're doing.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:05.440]   That would have been weird. Really? It would have meant the employees couldn't concentrate on
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.880]   the project on the on the actual event because they'd have to worry about security, they'd have
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.520]   to worry about flow, they'd have to worry about, you know, there'd be all those other things.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:18.640]   It's it's more like, it's it's it just feels it would just feel a little weird to me to say that
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:25.520]   our Steve Jobs is we're having a memorial service at Apple. We're going to basically shut down risk
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:31.280]   shutting down basically every mall that has an Apple store in it in all the all these where
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.120]   places that don't really aren't really set up for theaters and aren't set up for like 100 people
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.440]   in this place all doing the same thing. And also, are they saying that yes, this guy was so
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:46.240]   important to not only just for the people who use Apple products, but to the entire world that
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.440]   that kind of live sort of grandiose gesture is necessary. I really think they I do think that
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.680]   they really played it exactly right. Make sure everyone who works for it works for Apple at every
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:01.120]   level will be very, very interested. It also sort of seals that sort of bond a family that they try
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:06.560]   to create everyone who wears an Apple logo is somehow entitled to feelings or they own a piece
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.640]   of the Apple experience. And then a couple days later, when they've got all the server issues
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.120]   worked out, the ability to say, look, everybody can go and see this, but do it at your own time,
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.880]   your own place. Don't feel as though we have to bring everything to the world to a stop right now
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.280]   and have a moment of silence for Steve. I have to say that, you know, one of the things Al Gore
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.800]   did in his speech is exhort the Apple employees to continue making great stuff.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.920]   And I can't back to work. I can't get back to work in a way. He's an Apple board member.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.720]   Now who can get who can get me set up on iCloud? My second is all screwed up. Anybody?
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.680]   But I think that that was a little, I think in some ways you're right, Andy. I would have
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.960]   liked what Leander suggested because I think it would be nice for us. But I think also you're
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.720]   right, Andy. I think that this might have been an event that was really about galvanizing Apple
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:59.600]   to continue on. You know, it's not over. This now, you know, let's acknowledge Steve and let's
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.240]   move forward. Let me just play a little bit at the beginning of Johnny I.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.560]   Most innovative products. This is Tim Cook.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.760]   Johnny has some things he'd like to share with you today, Johnny.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.760]   And you're rightly under, Tim was not particularly inspiring.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.000]   Well, this is the guy. This is the spiritual successor I think to Steve. That's Lorraine Powell's
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   wife.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:31.360]   Now Steve used to say to me, and he used to say this a lot.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:40.960]   Hey, Johnny. Is it dopey idea? And sometimes they were.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:50.000]   Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.040]   But sometimes they took the air from the room
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.280]   and they left us both completely silent.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.800]   And then they left us both silent.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.640]   Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.160]   Or quiet, simple ones.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:19.360]   Which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:28.880]   And just as Steve loved ideas and loved making stuff,
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:38.160]   he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.240]   This is Johnny I've, I encourage you to watch the entire video because it's just
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:49.040]   it's very dramatic. There's great music in it. As I said, you'll cry when Nora Jones
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.600]   sings forever young. We're going to take a break, come back with more of Leander Akani from
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.040]   cultofmak.com. Great to have you, Leander. Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore, and of course Andy
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:06.480]   Naco from the Chicago Sun Times. And we'll talk about some other news in the Mac world in just a
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.000]   bit before we do though. May I mention my friends at hover.com. Elliot Noss was in town the other
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.240]   day talking about hover.com and some of some of their initiatives. Elliot is the CEO at Tukehouse,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:23.680]   which runs Hover. And he said, you know, and this is very much inspired, I think, by Steve Jobs.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:30.240]   Hover's focus is on customer service. He says, we're not a domain registry. We're a customer service
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.720]   engine. And I think that's a great way to look at it. There's not much to really to
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.120]   registering a domain name, despite what some of these other sites may make it look like. This
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:46.640]   doesn't need to be 50 clicks. You go to hover.com. You can actually go to Macbreak.hover.com right now
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.240]   and register your domain. You don't have to click a bunch and you're there. You're done.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:58.480]   But there's things that they built in that, you know, for instance, who is privacy is automatically
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:06.080]   built in. They have the no hold policy for service calls during business hours. And
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:15.040]   10% off when you use the offer code Macbreak at Macbreak.hover.com. One other thing they're doing
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.560]   now, which is kind of cool, if you register or want to register a domain name, we've been looking,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.680]   I mean, we're looking for a domain name and a show name for our new gaming show.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:29.920]   So I registered a bunch of names. And let's say I want to register gameon.com,
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.600]   a name, by the way, that we would love to have, but is long gone.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.760]   As I'm with out of that in 1999.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:44.400]   But now see what happens. It says gameon is taken and not for sale, but they do see these
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:50.160]   gold stars. These are premium domains that somebody owns, but is willing to sell. And the price,
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:55.760]   the actual price is right there next to it. So if you thought, well, you know, gameon expo was
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.880]   the name or game on world was the name you needed, you could see it right there that it's for sale.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:06.560]   So they're doing a little brokerage there. They will also, I love this trade in names that you've
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.000]   never used. I have dozens of domain names, including most of these game show domain names
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.840]   that I will never use because I registered them to save them. But I'll never use them. So if you
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.040]   have domains you've registered or renewed a hover and you want to upgrade to a better domain,
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.280]   you can sell them off by a new one. Hover will take it back. Wow. And they'll credit you
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.680]   everything you've spent on the clunker with hover. That's the original registration fee,
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.720]   any renewal fees at hover.com. How do they figure out the values?
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.440]   Well, because you spent it with, oh, you mean these values? I think these are asking prices.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.240]   I'm not sure how that works. Some of these are purchased. So that's, I think,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.320]   one of the things they're doing is if you have, if you own game freelancer,
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.080]   you can just put up, you can say, I'm willing to sell it for $9.99. That makes it so much more
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.000]   efficient because with all the other ones, you're sitting there going, you know, you start getting
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.120]   on it. You can't get it. Right. The other issue, of course, is if I, as the founder of Twitgo and
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:09.200]   say, I'd like to buy a domain name. The price suddenly goes up. I don't know what you're
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.360]   saying. Exactly. Being able to quietly do that. This is quiet. San Francisco Games.com. You could
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:20.320]   get it without, you know, triggering a land rush. So this is one of many things Hover does and does
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:27.920]   so well. I invite you to go to Macbreak.hover.com and take advantage of their great prices,
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:34.960]   their incredible customer service. They're in very slick domain management tools,
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.000]   domain names, names, main simple. And by the way, transfer your domain to Hover for $10,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.280]   which gives you another year. So it's also a very good price. It's like a breath of fresh air. I mean,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.440]   just like, I mean, as soon as I started using it, to be honest with you, after they started
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.320]   sponsoring, I found out of it. I didn't even know they existed. And now I'm just like hooked.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.960]   I'm like, yeah, that's all I use. Yeah. I've used them all.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:01.520]   Macbreak.hover.com. Take a look. And I think you will like it.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:09.680]   So we have we have a very it's pretty in the question area. Yeah, something exciting.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.960]   Something great. Everybody everybody. The vast majority of folks, there's three different
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:21.440]   questions that add up to, I think, almost almost 300, almost 30, 300 points, whatever,
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.240]   Wow. Is it's all about the TV. So based on all right, let's talk about the TV. Because you know,
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.840]   let's you know why I brought that up. Let's talk about you're the guy. You're the guy who said
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.720]   there would be a TV on the guy who said there's no way in the world. Apple would be so nuts.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:42.960]   And of course, Steve Jobs did something correct. He's so uncharacteristic. He leaked the next
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.920]   product from Apple here. Now, of course, everybody's digging into it. Leander, let's start with Leander
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:54.640]   because I don't want Alex to gloat too much. Did you know that there was going to be a TV lander?
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:00.560]   Well, it's been rumored for years. Yeah, for years. Literally. I think Jason Calicanis
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:05.360]   started it two years ago when he said, I know there's going to be a 50 inch HD TV from Apple.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.760]   And everybody marked him because it never came out. They've definitely got prototypes. I mean,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:16.000]   they've been making these things for sure. But there's a lot of weird things about an actual TV.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.880]   You know, like inventory problems, where they're going to store these in boxes at the Apple store.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.120]   You know, if they're going to start selling TVs, they're going to have to have boxes, huge stockrooms
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:33.280]   full of these things. But also the TV businesses, you know, people only buy TVs once every 10 years or so.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.880]   So I don't know, you know, there was all to talk about that. Like could Apple actually make
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:44.480]   it would be against their business model, which is sort of high churn. They update models every 18
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.640]   months or so every year with with with products like the iPhone. And you know, would they be able
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   to make a go at the TV business if there was an in such a sort of slow moving business? And of
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.920]   course, a lot of people have already updated their TVs already. They've got, you know,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.880]   flat screens or 3D TVs. That's why we're being afflicted with 3D TVs is to get
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.920]   the one thing that I think that I think that the one of the issues though is that is that people
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.600]   didn't update their phones very often before the iPhone either. You know, I mean, you know, so
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.640]   there was like, Oh, no one, you know, own people only get those every every three or four years.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.960]   Well, now a lot of people like me get them every, you know, 12 to 18 months. And the,
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.680]   the other thing is, is that I think that for people who have already gotten a flat screen,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.960]   you have the Apple TV to I don't think that's going to go anywhere. I think that gives them that
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.760]   action. It would integrate the Apple TV. Yeah. But I, but I think that I know I for one and,
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:35.280]   you know, just hate dealing with the TV part of my TV. You know, I just want the whole thing to be
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.600]   totally integrated as close as it can be by having the Apple TV, you know, connected to it. But it's
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:46.000]   just dealing with, you know, all the other pieces of it. And I'd be very happy to, to get rid of that.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.200]   And I think that the big thing that's missing on Apple TV and I think something they could
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.520]   probably add to the Apple TV too, is the ability to have an eyesight. I think when you, when you mix,
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.920]   I still think that the, the missing piece of FaceTime is that living room experience.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:03.440]   Well, I remember though, what Job says is TVs are too complicated. Yeah, but I think so.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.560]   And I've cracked it was the phrase that Isaac's in quotes. So, but what do you get?
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:14.880]   Hobby. I think it's the camera make it even more complicated. I know I think that the thing is,
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.520]   is that the Apple TV, I think the Apple TV too, this quote unquote hobby was always,
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.840]   let's figure out what people need to interact with.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.480]   And then we could put it in the TV. You know, this is, we were, we were all,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.080]   well, that's what that baffles me. Just put it in the Apple TV, let it attach to, you know,
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:32.640]   is there a party going on in there? I turned, I turned Leander down.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.720]   Leander, are you in New York City or something?
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.280]   Okay, I turned it down. They're coming to get him. All right. So,
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.920]   the, why not just do the Apple TV then? Why do you have to build it into it?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.200]   I still think that gets back into the complexity. I don't want to deal with all these wires in
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.240]   my living room. I don't want all the wires in the, in an eyesight sitting over top, you know,
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.600]   some kind of camera sitting on top of it. I just want it all built in and I want to be able to
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.680]   have my, I want, when, when someone, when I want to text message someone while I'm watching a game
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.880]   and where I want to do all these other things, I want that all to be integrated, you know,
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.360]   Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy's, Andy's got to get in here.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.880]   Oh, it's just, I mean, that's good for your, for the aesthetic. But here is the instructions on
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.920]   setting up a next generation Apple TV on one little card that will fit right on top of that
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:23.200]   little black hockey puck of a device. Step one, connect to HDMI cable from this device to any HDMI
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.840]   port to on the back of your existing TV. Step two, as complicated as it is, figure out one time and
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:36.160]   one time only how to switch the input of this TV onto to HDMI one, HDMI two, whatever it is.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:43.360]   Step three, epoxy over every other port. Never cut them again. Never pick up the remote for this
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.600]   TV ever again and control everything through your Apple TV. There's, there's just so much.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.120]   Could they put Siri in the Apple TV puck? Yeah, they could, they could do that. They could use
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.280]   that's one thing they could do is have voice commands at Microsoft. I mean, they could do that.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.440]   Actually, I mean, I think that it's a good idea. I think that if Apple wanted to make it a more,
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:06.000]   a more aggressive TV product, even if they were want go so far as to actually put a TV tuner,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.840]   inside the Apple TV itself and a camera, those are great things. The question that I'm wrestling
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:18.080]   with is that I cannot see any iteration of the Apple TV that would be a significant improvement
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:25.040]   over a $99 Apple TV with lots of extra features that you simply plug into whatever TV set you want.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.520]   I think that I don't think they have to, it has to be either or I think that there's enough people
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:34.160]   that are crazy enough like me to buy it to make it worth making. I mean, they already make TVs.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:39.760]   I mean, they make monitors. They make iMacs. I mean, there's not much more to it
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:46.800]   than an iMac. In fact, it's easier to make than an iMac. What if it was like an iPad that you put
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:56.080]   on the wall that had an HD camera so that you could do messaging, but also a touchscreen interface
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:01.040]   so that it would be more of an interactive, like an iPad. It's pages, it could also have TV.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:05.680]   If pages and all the other applications worked, I mean, if they open up, because I think that
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.960]   they're going to open up the iOS. I'm not pages, that's productivity. I don't think people would
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.200]   use it for productivity. They would use it for entertainment, for communication.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:21.040]   I think here's the issue is that my parents would not need a computer if they were able to have
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.120]   an iOS running on their home TV. That's the whole thing is that they wouldn't need all this.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.040]   All they do is check their email, surf the web, do all those things. The iPad already does all
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:34.080]   those things. The thing is, there's an enormous number of people that don't want to install
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.800]   stuff. They don't want to know how to run Windows. They don't want to know how to run iOS,
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.400]   you know, OS X. They don't want to run any of that stuff. The thing is you give them a TV,
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.720]   you know, and you use Siri for make for doing email and for things like that.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.280]   Or a Bluetooth keyboard. A Bluetooth keyboard sitting next to them, then they can just kind of
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.680]   set down on the coffee table and start typing. It sounds simpler. But again, you're making it
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:58.560]   easy to use it. Once again, you're making the case for a really, really cool Apple TV box.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:03.920]   You're not making the case for a dedicated TV. And also, as so as Apple now expected to have
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:09.440]   a 28 inch model, a 42 inch model and a 60 inch model, are they not to mention that the margins
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.520]   in television aren't very good. Oh, it's not that margins are high and ear couldn't make it work.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.120]   Yeah, but the margins aren't good with the PC industry. The margins aren't good with phones.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.400]   The margins aren't good with any of those. I mean, Apple does makes that work.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:25.680]   It's like it's like the old adage about being a porcupine. Yeah, I mean, it's it's like the
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:31.200]   old adage about picking up a porcupine. You can do it safely, but you have to really want to pick
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:38.320]   up that porcupine. And I feel as though for Apple to put this into an actual TV, they got a really
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.360]   want to sell this as one unit to go through all the trouble that they'd be taking on just by making
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:48.000]   this integrated unit. I know that they've I know that they've built these as prototypes.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.680]   I don't think anybody's doubting that. I'm not saying that it's foolish to think that they'll
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.600]   actually build it. All I'm saying is that my attitude is the same as my attitude before the
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.080]   iPhone before the iPad, where I can definitely see them making a tablet. However, I'm not inside
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:08.160]   Apple and I don't see their day to day decisions that create a world in which I could clearly see
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.600]   how they would do it. I'm certain that if they do an Apple in actual TV set, it would be sufficiently
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.840]   different from what we now think of as a TV that as the iPad is from any tablet that's been before.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.520]   I think Apple had a history of not liking to have a lot of things connected to other things. I think
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.120]   that the idea of at least Steve did, and I think that's one of the big reasons that you'd see it.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.400]   And these are all the same conversations that we had before the phone came out.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.360]   I know. This is exactly. It's like a real new something different.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.240]   Of course, it makes sense for Apple who wants to control the supply chain from end to end.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.880]   I mean, that was the brilliant thing Apple's done. So they want to disintermediate the cable companies.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.600]   They want to do everything. They want to sell to the TV shows. They want to sell you the movies.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.720]   And I understand why Apple would want to do this. After reading this book, I think I get a little
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.000]   more of a sense that Steve was very frequently throwing stuff against the wall to see if it would
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.680]   stick. This might just be one of those that's not going to stick.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.640]   You get the sports and news and I'll never go back to and then apps for everything else.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.920]   And I'll never go back to TV ever. Well, if they could do something like my kids already,
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.960]   they don't watch TV. They use they watch Netflix and they watch, you know, the CBS.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.080]   But I think I think it's up to you anymore. I think Alex hit the nail in the head. It's the
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.160]   only negative to court cutting right now is live sports, Academy Awards and news.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.920]   Everything else you can get. But how do you get those? And that's Apple will have to solve that,
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.400]   Andy. Yeah. I mean, if they were to do like a take the model in which they sell
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.120]   phones and take that apply that to TVs where they're going to subsidize the cost of the TV,
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.920]   where costs them like let's say $780 to manufacture, but you can buy it for $399 because
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   Discovery Channel and Turner Classic Movies and HBO and Cinemax and all these other companies
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.520]   are partly subsidizing the cost of this by selling you a contract that simply says we will sell you
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.920]   content via IP, not on a you have to buy this package of 100 channels. But if you want
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.000]   the if you want Turner Classic Movies, that's going to be five bucks for one HBO. That's going
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.720]   to be 10 bucks. I think that a lot of people would go for that because I was I've been contemplating
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.000]   court cutting myself and came to the realization that of the 400 channels on my cable box.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.720]   If I can get eight of them, that's really all I ever need. Isn't it possible though that what
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.960]   Steve meant was not a television set. But what Andy and I are talking about, which is a beefed up
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.600]   Apple TV. Isn't that possible that that's how we cracked it? That makes a lot more sense from
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.840]   a business perspective. I think we'd say he cracked it. I think he's talking about licensing
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.480]   and getting finding a way to have all your all your content come not from an antenna, not from a
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:52.400]   not from cable TV system, but making sure that there is a system that you can connect the people
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.760]   who are creating the content to the people who want to consume them and basically have
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.120]   a pretty direct pay pipeline between the two that makes again, it makes it a situation where
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.640]   Turner Classic Movies would really, really want to do this deal. Why they have to sort of
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:11.040]   go through eight different steps between a Verizon customer and themselves to get the money that
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.800]   they do for Turner Classic Movies. Why wouldn't they just simply get five bucks out of them directly
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.480]   through an iTunes account? I think it'd be more likely that Apple would make a deal with Comcast
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.800]   because the thing is, is that right now they're in the process of being written out of this,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.760]   you know, all of this stuff. And I think that they would be very incentivized to try to become,
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.960]   make sure that they're getting some little cut of somehow this is working.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.800]   Yeah. Also, there's an element that has, I first came across like about six or seven months ago,
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.000]   which is that someone someone first made me think of, yeah, but realize that if you're trying to
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.880]   cut out, if you're trying to cut out Comcast and Verizon by like canceling your cable service,
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.200]   think about where you're getting your internet service from to begin with. And so they have the
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.640]   ability to say, Oh, I know. So you have your, you're, you didn't subscribe to HBO or HBO package.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:01.440]   And you're simply using this service at this IP address. Well, we're concerned about network
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.760]   performance in your neighborhood. So I think we're going to throttle you down to dial up performance.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.840]   Well, they already have 250 gig limits here. I don't know what they have there, but Comcast
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.200]   already limits you to 250 gigs of download a month on the consumer version of the, of their
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.160]   subscription. So which, you know, takes a lot of work to get up to. I think I run about, I don't
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.240]   get to 250 gigs. I use it pretty heavily. And I watch a lot of Netflix and do a lot of things.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:30.880]   I think I run about 180 to 200. Well, anyway, we'll see. I hope it won't be till next year,
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.440]   according to the analysts. Yeah, I can't wait. I'm ready. I was, I'm sorry. I got distracted.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.120]   I was reading the story of antenna gate. Steve, Steve, it's a Hawaii at Kona Village. And his basic
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.080]   attitude was screw them if they don't like it. But there's more. This is juicy. There's stuff in here.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.160]   It's just great. I can't wait to read it. Apple estimated to sell, get this. Now, this is something
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:56.480]   else I learned from this in the entire life of the Apple two computer. They sold six million units.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:04.640]   They've already sold more iPhone four S's. Yeah. In two weeks, then they sold entire lifetime,
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.160]   10 plus years, decade plus of Apple twos, which made that company. That's how things have changed
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:16.800]   for this company. Well, on the other thing, UBS estimates that iPhone sales will top,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:25.520]   get this 42 and a half million units this quarter, this quarter. And the thing to remember is, is that
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.960]   whether they end up with an Apple TV or whether they end up with a just their spending, expanding
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.120]   it out boy. The issue is is not only are they selling just crazy amounts of hardware,
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.880]   but remember that they're getting 30% on every sale of everything made for all of this hardware.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.280]   They built an ecosystem that is much more efficient from a revenue perspective.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.440]   Bloomberg says that Jeff Robin, the creator of iTunes, the guy that they got when they got
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   Soundjam is leading the Apple TV thing. He's a software guy. He's the guy who convinced
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.440]   apparently convinced jobs to do iTunes for Windows. Smart move. The co-founder of Siri
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:12.160]   has left Apple. I guess his job. My job here is done. I'm going to go somewhere else. Dog kit
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:19.440]   louse. There were several reasons for the departure according to Cara Swisher, which was
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.040]   amicable and has been planned for a while. They included kit louse's family being in Chicago
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.560]   desire to take time off in an interest in brainstorming new entrepreneurial ideas.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:33.760]   Siri has moved on really. Well, not only that, but the people always read a lot into these sort of
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.040]   moves without factoring the idea that it's possible for this guy to wake up one morning and realize
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:43.360]   I've got $9.8 million. And I've got children who are growing up that I can now stay home and
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:50.240]   just watch them grow up. I don't need to rule the I don't need to stay to be a Steve Jobs. I
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.360]   I've got 10 million bucks. I can be very happy for the next 50 years of my life.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.960]   New CPUs are faster. Actually, not new, but faster CPUs with MacBook Pro.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.240]   Not even a press release. No press release. They just kind of show up in the marketplace.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.600]   That's not a message. I don't know what it is. What is the message?
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.800]   This is their back. They're back. I mean, they don't really
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.360]   cause they're going to keep us happy. They don't want to mess with prices.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.760]   Pro because the speed of the processing, you know, that's just not one of the points that
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:25.200]   Apple has ever emphasized. I don't think I'd be surprised if we see any kind of redesign of the
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.720]   bodies of the of the MacBooks or the MacBook Pros. They're not putting the energy into it.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.280]   They're basically going to keep us going 42 and a half million iPhones in a quarter. That's all you
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.880]   have to say. And they sold more. They sold more Macs than they've ever sold before. So they are.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.680]   It's not like they're it's not like they need to do anything is what you're saying.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.280]   All right. I'm going to take a break. We're going to do some questions. We have an iOS in
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.080]   the lion tip. We've got picks of the week. We are having fun now, baby.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.960]   Leander County here from cult of Mac. You do a great tribute to the iPod in its 10th anniversary.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.880]   The history of the iPod. Yeah, I really enjoyed reading that. I mean, actually,
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.600]   that's what's cult of Mac is so great. I mean, you really have been you're the historian in some
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.000]   ways, the keeper of the flame. You've been around a long time. You're like the hobbits
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.840]   scrambling in that last page of the book. And when you're done, you'll join the elves and leons.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:19.680]   Off to the Western lands. Cult of Mac.com. He's not a hobbit. He's the under Connie.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:25.280]   Although I'm not sure you kind of look like a dwarf Andy and I co maybe do you have an axe there?
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.680]   It's I think it's the sideburns. You look like Gimli. Doesn't he? Couldn't he be Gimli?
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.920]   Last week's last week's like when I was I was doing something on Fox TV in Chicago and the
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.000]   weather guy compared me to a character from Master in Commander, which I really approved of.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.600]   Oh, I like that. That's good. I really have to think about whether or whether I like this one,
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.920]   though. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I want to sort of encourage this one.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.200]   What what what character and Master in Commander did he compare you to?
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.960]   Couldn't have been any of them. My favorite series. I love them.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.040]   Right. Every one of them. Alex Lindsay also here from the Pixelcore. We're going to come back
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.400]   in a moment. But first a reminder that Siri, you may be able to talk to your phone, but I've been
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:11.440]   talking to my car for years. What kind of voice does your car have? It doesn't talk back to me.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.880]   That's the only thing I think they could add that. But the Ford Sync, I've been able to say,
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.200]   you know, set the cabin temperature to 73 degrees, play Bob Dylan forever young.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:27.760]   Actually, now you can say play Pandora, play a Pandora station or a Stitcher is it built in.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.560]   They've added these these new apps, the app link they call it that your smartphone is controlled
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.120]   with your voice. I mean, it's just really great. The new Sync with my Fort Touch adds a new feature.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.920]   You can actually have Wi-Fi. Your car is now a Wi-Fi access spot. You just add a little 3D USB
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.040]   dongle. You got two USB ports, plug it in and they got the antennas built in. They've got WAP
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.880]   built in. So it's secure. And as you drive down the road, all five of you can be surfing the net.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.440]   Well, not the driver. We should keep the driver off the net probably.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:03.280]   Go to fort.com/technology to see all these amazing technologies they're building into the new
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:09.520]   Ford cars. They're a pleasure to drive. The engines are powerful yet very fuel efficient
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:17.600]   and reliability fit and finish second to none. Alan Malawi's really taking this company and
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.640]   made it a 21st century car company. And if you want to see the technologies, take a look forward.com/technology.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.280]   We're going to have a Ford barbecue here on November 13th.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.800]   I think it's the 13th. Yeah. During Twit, whether we're going to have the cars out front,
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.160]   you should come. Who's doing the barbecue? We're going to do the barbecue. We're going to rent a tent.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.400]   We're going to have a barbecue invite people to come see the cars and watch the show. In fact,
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.520]   our new gaming show will be launching right about that. So that'll be fun.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:50.000]   Ford.com/technology are better yet. Go check out the new 2012 Ford Focus at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:00.080]   You will be very impressed. Let's see here. What are the top questions in our pixel core live?
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.400]   One of the questions that we had here was about thinking that it was some
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.840]   - I cloud in general. Would somebody just explain it to me? There's a cloud. What the hell? And then
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.200]   photo, the photo stream, all of a sudden I got all these photos showing up every - Everything
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.720]   you're taking. Everything I'm taking. Showing up on that photo. It doesn't seem like I can delete
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.520]   them. No. No. You can't delete them. We didn't talk about that last week. That's a little bit
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.240]   annoying. So my number one complaint. So I got a picture of my butt. Now it's on every single -
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.600]   I have 40 pictures of my ceiling. I'm looking at them ceiling because my daughter picked up my
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.960]   - So they go into iPhoto. So I'm going to launch iPhoto. There's this now in the new iPhoto. There's
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.800]   a photo stream thing. And everything you take a picture of however stupid - And I have it on
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.760]   like four computers. And I can't. So is there a way - I can't - is there - Because that's the photo stream.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.680]   There is an off switch for photo stream. Yeah, but but do it. But it's not exactly granular.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:59.520]   I definitely - Oh, I mean - neither is turning off Bluetooth. But you got to accept the fact that
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.680]   at some point you are going to have to figure out how to make your phone do something. Well, I do
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:09.440]   - I love it. It's not that good. I love it. It's backing things up. I do love that. I just wish
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.880]   that I could go. I mean, I went to iCloud.com. I don't see where I can delete it. I don't know.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:20.160]   Well, because you're not really deleting it already. You're just sort of turning off that album. It's
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.640]   a special smart album. So do I have to delete it on the source material and then it deletes
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:31.440]   everywhere else? Does that work? I think that it is. Go ahead. Every iOS device and - every
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.520]   iCloud Studdly device that you have that has the photo - that has the photo stream feature
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.600]   is basically contributing to a pool of photos that's actually hosted up on iCloud.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.840]   Yeah, that lives somewhere that you can't access and delete.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.760]   Exactly. And that's true of iCloud in general. That -
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.720]   It just works whether you want it to or not.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.280]   Yeah. So the bottom line is that if you're out partying -
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.440]   - what you're doing, you're out partying. You think it's great. And you have like a photo stream
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:04.080]   going to your Apple TV at home with the kids. Just think about that. So you can delete the stream
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.960]   feature that's on, but you can't do individual -
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.920]   When you go into your account settings in iCloud.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.360]   Oh, oh, okay. I'm gonna go. You're just being an apologist. You're just being an
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.840]   apologist. That should - I'm to the chat rooms telling me how to do this. Go to your account settings.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.280]   You can - you can reset that. And I can reset it. We'll sort of move all photos.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.880]   That's the choice. Yeah. I think that this is the number one - this is the number one thing that
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.520]   Apple has to address in an update is that for the photo stream to be. You know, the little one.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.040]   Wait a minute. Cult of Mac has apparently written an article on this lander. Can you explain?
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:44.800]   Don't look at me. I didn't write it. No. You're just the one - I was telling you that
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.360]   Colum held me. I knew that was going to happen. I'm gonna collude. I will say that it's - it is.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.600]   How did - here it is. How did delete photos from iCloud's photo stream? Alex Heath wrote it,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:05.520]   cult of Mac.com. It is log on. And reset photos. What deletes everything?
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.800]   Right. What doesn't delete it? The device that actually took the photo still has it in its private
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.360]   photo roll is you're just removing it from the shared library inside iCloud. You're just clearing
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.960]   the cloud. Right? So the cloud doesn't have it. Whatever took it is still on it. It just seems like - I
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:29.920]   got to say that the more I use iOS 5 and especially iCloud, the more I'm convinced that this really
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:35.840]   did need a keynote style event that didn't just simply gloss over and with great features like iCloud
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.760]   and great features like photos and great features like document sharing. That's this one of these
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.160]   things that really needed someone to walk this through feature for feature for feature and not
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.600]   only show off how Apple imagined people would be using these features but would also actually show
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.080]   how these things actually work. Not a tutorial but - and all I have to do is turn this on and that's
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.160]   how you turn that on. Now I've got - now here's what I can do with my iPhone now that I've turned
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:04.080]   that thing on. I think that there's so much confusion because it affects not only the movement of data
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.080]   but goodness I've spent like - had to spend two or three days figuring out like the battery life
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.840]   on the 4S because so much of it is just there now a whole bunch of new features that are related to
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.960]   reminders in iCloud that will just keep the CPU active and keep certain radios active.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.000]   And you get down to the conclusion that no this is not a bug, this is not a defect in the software,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.320]   it's just that all the rules for how do I conserve power in this device have changed now that there's
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.600]   so many new features on it. That's why I bought a big-ass battery. I mean really that's how I
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.320]   solved it. Yeah I mean the - I will say that on the other side of it it used to be such a pain in the
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   neck. I have - because I had so many photos on my iPhone that it was a pain in that every time I
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.240]   plugged in I photo would open and it would take literally like 10 minutes before it was ready to
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:51.920]   import whatever the last photo is that I wanted to just merge with iPhoto and I love the fact that
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   I can sit there and take a bunch of photos and I get by the time I get to my computer it's on my
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.600]   computer. I do know and I can - so far there's nothing I've wanted to delete but I'm just dreading that day.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.280]   So - because then I'll have to leave it all.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:10.960]   The other question people asked and I'll let each of you answer if you have something to say,
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.800]   what is the biggest surprise in Walter Isaacson's book? Who wants to go first? Raise your hand.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.520]   Go ahead Alex. I think the biggest surprise was just how simple and basic his house was
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.480]   from the photos that I saw. I mean and how simple his lifestyle was. I think that was the - I mean
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.880]   I think a lot of the other stuff we had heard before or we had sometimes assumed - at least for me
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:36.960]   anyway - but I thought it was really interesting of how much of a close to normal life he lived
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.320]   outside of what he was doing. Andy were there any surprises?
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:47.040]   If we discount one of the big bombshell ones that was sort of leaked in advance the idea that
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.680]   yeah he could have gotten surgery like as soon as he was diagnosed but he decided to do the nuts
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.800]   and berries approach. I think that - again I'm only about a quarter of the way through - but the idea
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:03.280]   that early on it sort of defines some guy who was sort of like the proto Steve Jobs, some hippie
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:11.760]   by a Friedland who - Oh wasn't that interesting? Yeah. That sort of showed a version of an example
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:19.040]   of someone who was about 80% of what Steve would become. Someone who was very very like - he got
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.000]   the idea - the book suggests that Steve's concept of the reality distortion field came from this
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.200]   guy who also was very very focused and very very intense and able to be very very charismatic and
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.920]   get people to do things. He had a - this guy had a commune that was sort of a hippie like a - let's
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.200]   meditate and raise organic vegetables but quickly turned it into okay you're going to be on carrot
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.880]   production and apple production and we need you to manufacture these wine presses that we can then
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:53.600]   sell. He ended up becoming a billionaire gold miner. Right and then - one of the fun things about
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:58.320]   this book is that it's not like - Isaac's in is sort of like a background character in this book
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.000]   because sometimes he'll talk about the process of putting this together especially how - you know
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.400]   it gets back to Steve that he's been talking to - that Isaac's been talking to this guy
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.720]   and gets a phone call from Steve saying don't believe anything he says he's a charlatan he's
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.400]   this guy he's all that in the other. So that was kind of cool if you're writing a - if you're writing
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:22.160]   a movie of this as fiction you would probably want to have like the 18, 19, 20 year old Steve Jobs
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:28.320]   meet some guy who was like the Steve that he was going to become only with not enough
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.600]   enhancements to actually become these Steve Jobs. Just like this is the development version of Steve
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:40.080]   Jobs. Leander any surprise - what was the biggest surprise to you in the book or shock or something
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.800]   you didn't know? Given that none of us has finished the book yet. Yeah yeah yeah I haven't finished
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.560]   actually I saw it really in the end but I saw it in the beginning but I saw it in the middle
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.600]   so I've jumped around but I read I read most of the last few chapters
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:03.520]   and he didn't see Siri until he resigned in August this year. So Siri they showed him Siri at the
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.800]   board meeting where he went to tell the board that he was stepping down as CEO that was a surprise
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.280]   because I thought he would have - yeah - they bought Siri two years ago I think. Yeah Al Gore told that
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:21.280]   story at the memorial and they asked I guess it was Steve that they were showing him Siri and he says
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:29.040]   well are you a boy or a girl and Siri says well they haven't assigned me a gender yet and apparently
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.960]   got a great gales of laughter from everybody including Steve Jobs. He would have it does seem
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.520]   like something he would like. He was a prankster much like was. That is a shock that he hadn't seen
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:48.720]   that sooner. Maybe lending some credence to the contention that Jobs didn't pay that much attention
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:54.720]   to the 4s that he was really focused on the iPhone 5. That doesn't seem possible given all.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.040]   Siri would have been part of the iPhone 5. I wonder how long he's how involved he's been in
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:04.160]   Apple these last few years since he's been sick because a lot of the last few chapters just you
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:11.120]   know show that he was very very ill and he was mostly he spent a lot of time conversing.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.280]   So it made me wonder how involved he was involved in the whole iPhone 4s.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.560]   Well on the iPhone 5. It was Bill Campbell who told that story by the way not Al Gore thank you
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.280]   Chairman. Yeah Bill Campbell that was interesting. I mean one of the things I was surprised is
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.720]   Bill was one of the people who got who said yes we should fire Jobs. I think we get the most
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:39.520]   detailed accurate account ever of how Jobs was ousted by Scully. It's much more complicated
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:47.200]   and convoluted. I think in many cases it's easy for people to say that Apple just drifted without
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.480]   him and that might be the case. But he needed to go do next. He needed to go fail and then he needed
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.040]   to come back with what he learned. When Jobs was 22 and the founder of the company they brought in
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.240]   Mike Scott Apple's first president and this was not a shock to me. I had kind of heard it before but
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:08.640]   it confirmed it basically to manage Steve. And Mike Markola was in basically to manage Steve.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:13.200]   Even John Scully was expected to manage Steve and when John couldn't that's when Steve was ousted by
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:22.800]   the board. You know I share a little bit of the dismay that you have Leander reading this book.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:29.040]   It is definitely warts and all but it's really I found it fascinating. It's very hard for me to
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.160]   put it down. I want to know the next one. It's not really a fascinating book. Yeah yeah totally.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.480]   It is. There's so much detail there. I mean people were saying on Twitter you know stop the
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.400]   news stories, stop all the leaks. You know there's going to be nothing for us to read. But there is
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.560]   there's so much every few pages of these first stories. There is absolutely plenty.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:51.280]   It's those other surprising things that he was that way all the way to his very very first job
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.040]   that he was abusive and abrasive and no one really liked him or wanted to get around with him.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.800]   That seemed like the sort of thing that only happens once you have the liberty of having
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:07.360]   so having lots of power to throw around. He believes that his or a bad thing. He believes that his
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:14.640]   fruterian diet would keep him from having any body odor right which it was to all accounts
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.200]   nobody else agreed with. In fact when he was working at Atari they made him work the night shift
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.640]   because nobody wanted to be around him during the day. He was too stinky and his bare feet he
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:30.640]   wouldn't wear shoes. The other thing I thought was very interesting was how close gates and jobs were
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.400]   at the beginning. They were they were almost peers and buddies. Do you think that in some ways
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:41.680]   Android for jobs was Microsoft again? Yes. Like he got close he started working really closely.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:45.600]   He brought somebody onto the board. I think that you know a lot of this one thing that becomes very
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.960]   clear is that this is his issue with Android was very personal. You know you know he brought someone
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.320]   on the board. He talked to them. He showed them a lot of stuff and then they went out and did
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.480]   something that was much like his. I think that that was what the fact that not just the fact that
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.600]   they stole something from him from the outside. Like looked at the iPhone and did something like
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.800]   it. It's that he had brought someone in so personally and in the same way that he did gates.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:13.760]   But trail and abandonment are thread throughout the book and I presume accurately portraying his
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:20.880]   life throughout his life. Some of the sadness is that Steve must have been in many ways
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:27.200]   a very unhappy person much of the time. There were time moments of great happiness but also
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.880]   he even says he was somewhat bipolar. He'd be very depressed and then very manic and excited.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:41.200]   Anyway it's a great book. I think we're fortunate that we had a biographer of Walter Isaacson's quality
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:49.120]   who had such access to somebody before his death and that jobs was so forthright in this and the
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.880]   people that he's Isaacson spoke to were forthright and jobs let them tell the truth.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.480]   In some ways it's a great legacy from Steve Jobs which he intended for his children but we
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.880]   benefit from it. The truth came out about this very complex, difficult, prickly fella.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.080]   I think you rarely see an authorized biography that is so warts and all.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.560]   Wow. You know like so like just includes everything.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.920]   Let's get our iOS tip of the week. I forget who does that. Do you do that?
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:24.400]   Do you have one? Yes. So this came in. I got this from my Twitter feed.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:29.200]   So I twitted out that I needed a tip. I was like what should I do? There's a whole bunch of
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:36.800]   people that responded. And one of the things, so if you go into settings and you go into your
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:44.160]   keyboard settings and one of the things that's kind of interesting is this is under general
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:49.680]   and then keyboard is down at the bottom you have shortcuts that I didn't realize were there.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.840]   They're really cool. So anyway so this is a little like a simple text expander kind of thing.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.160]   Yes. Where basically you can add a shortcut. Yes.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.800]   I want to add a shortcut and you know whatever the phrase is that I want to add and it can be
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.440]   pretty long and then you can add a shortcut that you can just type in. So I like I have the address
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:12.080]   to hear for instance and when I want to do that I just type in you know here ADDR and it pops up
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.320]   then I hit return and boom that's my address. My address isn't imported in so it's very much
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.840]   in the same way things that people ask all the time are really here texting and you know it's just
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.600]   hidden you know it's one of those there's so much stuff when people started sending in the tips by
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.600]   the way now I have enough just from that one ping I have enough tips for like the next three
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.000]   months. My tip is come back and explain how iCloud works someday. Okay I'm working on it.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.240]   We'll give it to our show. Yeah okay okay so we'll let me let me think about that.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.680]   So anyway so but the and here's the great thing about iCloud though to talk about it I just
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.160]   type that in and my note showed up like seconds later on my in my computer. Yeah I turned it on
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.600]   I mean it's good to have. So anyway so that's my that's my little tip is turn you can turn on you
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.280]   can you can put all your address and all the things that you need to send people constantly
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.840]   or constantly are coming in a lot of times typing on that little keyboard your address gets tiring
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.240]   over and over and over again or whatever those things are and I'll throw in another tip the camera
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.880]   on this phone really is that good and if you want to go to Lisa Bettany's camp plus site
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.920]   c-a-m-p-l dot-us she's she got all the old iPhones and took the same picture with each that's the
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:24.880]   original iPhone horrible 3G horrible now we're getting okay 3GS not bad the iPhone 4 getting
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.680]   better look at the reflections I think that's where you see some big differences and the detail
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.040]   I've been very happy with the iPhone 4s it's doing a great job she even compares it with it
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:42.240]   and an s95 and yes there's more detail in the s95 but I think the 4G 4s is good enough to do a
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.080]   make your point and shoot camera don't you agree yeah yeah I don't and she also does a
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:54.160]   landscape original iPhone this is with lots of light obviously 3G 3GS really starts to get good
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:01.520]   on the iPhone 4 4s I think this is the detail the clarity look at the detail in the shadows even
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.400]   it's a little bit better on the 95 and of course a lot better on the 5D but
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.080]   but that's how it's hard yeah how could you but look at that yeah that's that's pretty darn good so
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:18.640]   I've been very happy with that camera it's fast it does a great job that's a good post if you want
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:27.280]   to check it out Lisa Bettany's cam plus blog and our lion tip mr. not co well this is actually
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:34.000]   a Mac OS tip this is a feature that's been in the OS since the early 90s but people really have
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:41.120]   forgotten that it actually exists but now that we have a speech speech assistance in on the iPhone
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:48.320]   people forget that the Mac OS has a speakable items feature where if you go into systems if you go
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:54.240]   into preferences click on speech and then click on speech recognition there is an on-off switch
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.400]   for this thing called speakable items and if that if you turn that on you will see in the
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.280]   little corner of the screen just a little like little microphone logo and whenever you either
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:09.680]   hold down a special hotkey on the keyboard it's a defaults to escape or say a special turn on a
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:15.040]   continuous recognition you can basically just talk commands to the Mac and have a do stuff for you
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.920]   so you can do things as as simple as a launch safari switch to safari all the way to
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:29.040]   new mail to Leo Laport and then it will look through your address book find someone who
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:34.560]   matches Leo Laport and then create a brand new email message to this person it has a long long
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:39.120]   library things you can do well one of the most useful features is just the speech command show
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.720]   me what to say in which case it'll drop a pop-up box on the screen that will just give you a list
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:51.840]   of things you can try to say that will actually work and the added enhancement is that there is
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:57.680]   a special folder inside your library folder if you go to your your home folder then go to library
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.320]   you have to hold down the option key over the go menu to reveal your library folder but go to the
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.360]   library folder go to speech then go to a folder called speakable items and now anything you put
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.920]   inside this folder the the name of that file becomes a speakable item like a feature so if you did
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.480]   something like let's let's say that you've already created an automated workflow that is essentially
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.280]   your end of the day make sure that everything's tied it up tidy up your desktops do it back up and
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.320]   then shut down the computer if you simply save this in that folder as i'm going home close down
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.680]   the computer and then go to sleep you literally just name it that phrase and so all i have to do is
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.960]   just as you're as you're about to turn off the lights and computer i'm going home turn off the
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.880]   computer then go to sleep wow and that will activate it will activate that as i guess not
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.280]   parsing the sentence so to speak it's simply saying you created something with that name on it and
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.200]   you can do i mean the fact that you can put these things in a special folder means that if you are
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:56.480]   handy with apple script and automator you really can do really complicated things uh let me try
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.240]   this let me just try so i'm going to press the escape key what time is it
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:10.400]   it's 1240 wow right try try to say tell me a joke tell me a joke
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:20.240]   hold it down wait a half a second and then say it tell me a joke
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:29.280]   you're loving me i wonder if it's confused i'll give you a by the way a really nice little
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.240]   tip somebody told me about it comes with some basic voices uh and that was using Alex
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:40.720]   nicely named to talk back yes i thought that was an excellent choice there are lots of choices
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.640]   and you can buy more yeah but these are all free remember the old silly ones like cellos and bubbles
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:51.440]   those are not normally installed but you can't install but there are foreign languages
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:57.840]   like i can have daniel emily and serina you want to hear daniel yeah he says hello my name is emily
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:04.320]   i am a british english voice hello my name is serina oh bonjour enough chokes back to work
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:14.080]   enough jokes back to work so so um tim guck must have heard that one enough jokes back to work
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:22.160]   here here you go tell me a joke knock knock who's there dad dad who
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:31.200]   dad who dad's all folks oh they're not great they're not great jokes but
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:37.840]   yeah back in the mid 90s when like i was a bit of a more of a nut about automation i actually
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:43.600]   i was doing so much with speakable items that i actually like set up microphones next to my work
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.400]   desk next to the chair that i often sat and when i was editing stuff and one next to the door
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.960]   and so there were there were lots of scripts going on so i could just be sitting at the
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:58.240]   sitting at the at the sofa and saying a computer is running is there any interesting email
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.480]   so what fire off a script do you use computers the case so you can listen continuously with
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.720]   the keyword and and they suggest computer is that a good one you can use whatever you want if you
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:15.040]   want to say oh genie you know so if i say computer now it will computer do i have to do i just talk
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:19.840]   to it did you you have to turn you have to turn that feature on do you have listened continuously
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.000]   with key keyword turned off yeah and then keyword is required before each command
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.840]   so i should be able to say computer tell me a joke right computer tell me a joke
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.320]   i think it doesn't like me it's possibly going to have the it's possibly going to the right
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:38.320]   input or it's possible that it's a little bit bit bit fuddled um listen well when you're at
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.840]   the when you're at the desktop obviously listening while i wait with this press is used to do it but
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:46.560]   yeah you you can set it up that way i wish it weren't quite so labor intensive i mean it's it really
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:52.320]   is one of those features that they did it they put it in there and they're not willing to obsolete
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:56.880]   it but they're not willing to enhance it i mean it would be so cool if you could just do computer
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:01.200]   play me anything by elvis costello right and that's something that it could easily parse but you that's
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:05.600]   something you'd have to set up a script for but you can you can set up a script because an apple
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:11.440]   script uh these you can uh have speakable items basically list match anything that's being said
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.400]   against any known list so you could write one line of apple script that says build the list out of
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:21.120]   every artist that's in my to his library and then another line that simply says another line that
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:26.560]   simply says you know listen for anything inside this list then get that get the thing that was
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.040]   selected from that list via audio uh and then simply play that artist and that's not that you
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.400]   could write in like maybe a half a dozen lines i'm thinking and then just put it in the speakable
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.760]   items folder i have to play it's a place for its labor intensive but it's it's a fun feature so
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.880]   there's enough there's enough in here that's built in that you can have a lot of fun with it right
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:45.440]   we're going to quickly get our picks of the weekly and do you have a pick for us it could be
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.200]   software hardware you don't have to because you know we don't want to throw you or anything

[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.040]   production the the production guys from twitch should be listening right now um so a lot of times
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.120]   you're trying to figure out your onset and like do i have enough hard drive space to um put this
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.560]   file you know to who loves this vinslaflora wrote about it yeah yeah this is wow so so basically you
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:32.160]   can you can go in here and and uh type in i've got a 200 i've got well we could just show it on the
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.040]   screen because it's i can't use it because i don't know how it works so anyway so you say i've got a
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:43.440]   i've got a 600 gigs left uh how much uh space do i have recording time do i you know so and i can
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.160]   change it say and i got a dslr i have i'm shooting 24p and it says okay we got 30 hours well what
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.160]   about the area lexa well at tenety p well you got 41 hours if i have a sony f three and i can change
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.320]   my codec and i can decide what i'm capturing it gives me the number of hours that i have left to
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.560]   capture and this is the kind of stuff that we have to deal with on set all the time and you have to

[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.200]   there's a picture i i put a link in the show notes if you want if you want to show it really is a
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.680]   perfect looking replica of how's the how's i there uh it's 59 bucks it's not going to be shipping
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:46.560]   until like the end of winter but it's like oh i just i shouldn't think about this i should just
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.120]   buy this and then be surprised four months later five months later when this actually arrives this
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:57.440]   it's just too cool a thing not to have i'm sorry dave let's see if it uh but now you have we i want
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.000]   i want voices for siri
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.440]   i don't know what's going on this is
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:13.360]   just looking at you oh i see we're in the uh movie i get it that's the movie music
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:21.680]   siri's looking at you dave anyway think geek.com it's only 60 bucks it's too long of a start
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.160]   yeah if they're making videos they're you got to get to that faster on board well it's a set job
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.040]   that you know you're in i know but they're really if you need to do that and follow
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:33.120]   yeah all you have to do is see the photo of it and if you've got 59 dollars you're soon not
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.760]   gonna have 59 dollars this is every bit as exciting as so they just they just make it way too easy to
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.920]   not really think this thing but it really is just a too cool a thing to
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:46.880]   i have to all right we're gonna jump to the last 20 seconds here it is is talking to you now
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:49.360]   here we go give me the idea
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:39:02.320]   open the pod bay doors that's a rather insensitive thing to say to an intelligent agent
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:11.440]   but it's a long way to go for that boy by the way i have purchased the uh obviously my
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.600]   pick is going to be this book but i've purchased this book in audible form it has it unaudible quite
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.120]   nicely read you put your money where your mouth is over and over and over and over and over and
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.880]   on kindle because i wanted to get it like liana did early it got at 7 p.m. on sunday night right when
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.200]   the 60 minutes started i purchased it on apples i booked no they were good they didn't ship it
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.640]   till midnight and then i ordered a couple of hard covers from amazon you know it's kind of worth
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.240]   getting the book because there's pictures in here that don't reproduce well this is the uh the inside
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.960]   cover uh and that's just a beautiful picture of i found that to be so fascinating just this
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:49.280]   wife loreen and his son read and that just is beautiful seeing his actual desk like what what
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.840]   kind of cluttered you would expect it to be uh a little tidier wouldn't you but no
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.080]   and you gotta you gotta imagine that every mac developer is like magnifying like those shots
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.440]   a thousand times yeah this is one of my compete good company icons on that says that yeah it's
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.360]   just he's using my calendar app yay it's really neat it's just it's well worth buying the book
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.840]   it's a good not only is it a good read but there are lots of pictures in here that you won't get in
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.160]   the you can you get them in the kindle version they're very washed out the i-book version at least
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:29.840]   they look good but uh i think owning the book it's probably worthwhile that's it for mac break weekly
