[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.680]   Bonjour, J'Oya N'Ou.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.600]   There was no Christmas in sight.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.480]   And now it's just everywhere.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.720]   For those of you in the club and club to it, I think there will be a highlight of what's
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.560]   decorating the studio.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   The amazing--
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.080]   Yeah, Burke just like, "Phew!"
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   Everything.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   He taught the Christmas bomb.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   It was great.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   He did it.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   He did it.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   He did it.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   Santa threw up all over the window.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.200]   Also here, Andy and Akko, whose childhood memories of a closet seem to have returned.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   He's very--
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   You can't forget.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.080]   It's a little weird, but OK.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   Hi, Andy.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.520]   Good to see you from WGBH Boston.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.960]   It involves exotic Italian meats and cheeses.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.320]   There's nothing to be mocked, sir.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.720]   It's illegally smuggled to--
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.200]   Yeah, illegally illegally.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   It's illegally illegally.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.360]   It's only illegal if you ask too many questions about it.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   And we're not going to ask many questions about it.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   We're not going to ask those questions.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   No, we're not.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.200]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.800]   And also with us, Mr. Alex Lindsey from Office Hours, who's taking time off his 24-hour day
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   to join us.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   It's great to have you.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.240]   I'm taking time off, but everyone else is still talking.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   Yeah, our office hours never.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.440]   Is there any point in like three in the morning or anything where there's just not nothing
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.160]   going on or is it all around the clock?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.200]   So there are times when there will be like maybe 20 people in there and you see people
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.600]   kind of working away or they'll just be some cameras turned off or whatever.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.400]   But if you get in there and start asking questions, people just start turning the cameras on.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   Like you know, like they start talking.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   It wakes up.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   It wakes up.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   It wakes up.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.000]   Well, it's just that people are working and they're in the room.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.760]   It's like the ultimate water cooler.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   Yes.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.920]   They're hanging out and they're working and they don't feel like the need to talk.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   I mean, I would say about 80% of the time there's a discussion going on or a lab or something
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   else.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.360]   We're starting to do these labs now for an hour where there was Alex Goner, Alex Forney
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   Goner.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.000]   He's probably one of the top experts in motion, Apple's motion in the world.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.440]   And someone asked him something.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.720]   He did like a little lab in after hours.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.080]   And suddenly I got all these discords.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.040]   Like Alex Goner, it was like Morpheus is fighting Neo.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.200]   You know, like Alex Goner is showing us how to use motion.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   You know, and suddenly like all these people like start piling in and so to watch it.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.040]   And so it kind of happens organically at the moment.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.920]   And we schedule a couple of them.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.520]   You know, we're doing some stuff with Isadora, which I've talked about in the past with learning.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.720]   Andy Carluccio is probably one of the top experts in Isadora and someone from Isadora
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.080]   sits there and they try to teach me how to do Isadora and I'm not very good.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.440]   So I, so it just me looking like an idiot for an hour every three times a week of just
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.880]   like, okay, now what do I connect?
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.760]   And then I forget what they told me the last time and then I try to do it again.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.560]   And so I'm slowly getting it.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   Good job.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.240]   You know, this is a slow period.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.400]   But so I'm sorry to say, well, I would prefer a Mac break weekly to discuss the latest Macintosh
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   and things like that.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   Well, no, we can find something to talk to you.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.600]   But a lot of this this week is weird is going to be like lawsuits and court battles.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   And for instance, Apple is suing Russia, which is a kind of a weird there.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   There.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.960]   Yeah, they they're taking the market regulator to court.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.440]   They brought action against Russia's federal anti monopoly service.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.080]   Earlier this year, the FAS issued a request to stop abuse in the market.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.520]   That's a this is a direct quote from by the way.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   This is the story.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.720]   The only place I can find the story is in RT.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.640]   So this is the Russian from the Russian point of view.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.760]   It's like listening to the Pittsburgh Steelers football network when you're when you're watching
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.080]   the Super Bowl, you're going to get a little bit of bias in favor of the home team.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.520]   Apple seeking judicial review of the warning, which forces the iPhone maker.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.160]   Oh, this is the one that allows app developers.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   To tell.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.400]   Oh, this is no, no, no, it's not about Russian apps to tell customers about alternative payment
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.120]   options when using the app store.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.640]   So this is exactly what Apple was ordered to do by the courts in the US.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.520]   The warning delivered by a government body in August gave Apple a September 30th deadline
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.760]   to resolve the issue.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   They didn't.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.440]   So the country's antitrust watchdog launched proceedings for non compliance.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.600]   You're in trouble, Apple.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.160]   Big trouble.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.040]   They had find Apple nine hundred six million rubles earlier this year, which sounds like
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   a lot of money.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.480]   But it's cigarette money for apples 12 million for violating competition principles because
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.680]   the company placed for sixions up on a Russian app called kesbodoski safe kids.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   That's 12 million US.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   12 million US.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.520]   Yeah, not gonna.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.680]   Anyway, so we'll see.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.600]   I don't, you know, I don't know exactly how well Apple will do and a he's lost suit in
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   Russian courts.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.480]   Yeah, this is an uphill battle for Apple.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.720]   And I think it's for regulators in the United States, it's an uphill battle for the regulators.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.840]   But in Russia, probably Apple's got going to have to sort something out there.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   They're going to have to do something.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   And it's weird because it's like this is an international problem and Apple's an international
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   company.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.480]   But every, every little nation within that inter nation is going to try to come up with
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.800]   different rulings and different parameters and making a uniform.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.000]   We've had a decade of a unified app store, basically.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.760]   And now it's going to be subject to all these different regulations and all these different
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   parts.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.680]   And the EU does things very differently than the US and just reconciling those two.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.200]   It's a huge challenge, but there's also what's going on in China and Russia, which are very
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.600]   different, very large markets.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.920]   And it's, I think it's going to be tough for many businesses, not just Apple, trying to
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:12.200]   navigate international law and protectionism and freedom of speech versus what they see
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.000]   as cultural content laws.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.640]   It's going to be a huge mess going forward.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.200]   Actually, Apple may have opened Pandora's box because we're learning now, just now from
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.840]   the information that Apple made a $275 billion deal with the Chinese government.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:36.560]   This was a secret deal, but Wayne Mott, the information reported that this morning, they
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.880]   secretly signed an agreement years ago, estimated to be worth $275 billion with Chinese officials
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.520]   promising.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   Apple would do its part to develop China's economy and technological prowess through
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.840]   investments, business deals and worker training was a five year agreement in 2016.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.400]   So I guess it's maybe now just at the end of its term.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.240]   Yeah, but maybe it did roll over.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.480]   It's a secret to you.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.560]   Like we knew about the parts of it.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.600]   Like DD was very famous and other parts of the deals, but I don't think anyone saw it
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.000]   as a huge unified deal before Wayne.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Right.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.880]   And this is where Tim Cook would does stuff that this is how Apple became much larger
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880]   is Steve Jobs.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.040]   I don't think we'd have the patience for it.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.080]   And I think that an Apple probably would have a lot more trouble in China if Tim Cook hadn't
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   worked out.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   How are we going to do this?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.800]   Now, a lot of times when you make these deals, I mean, there's a variety.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   So there are a lot of deals that get done in countries.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:48.840]   There's like, if you want to, there's an entire business around, oh, I want to build
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.660]   I want to sell you an air, you know, aircraft, you know, into South Africa or into Israel
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.260]   or into wherever.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.260]   And they have to agree.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.240]   They'll agree to make the tires in South Africa and do this other thing.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.800]   And these are offset, you know, offset deals and these offset deals are billions and billions
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.000]   of dollars and they're happening every single day.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.200]   So it's easy for someone in the information to go, look what I found.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.080]   And everybody who works in international things like, yeah, yeah, you found what everybody
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   does.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.720]   So like everybody's doing all the time.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.000]   Every defense contractor, every manufacturer, everybody's making deals like this.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.920]   Like this is not, this is like, okay, what we call Tuesday.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.760]   As you pointed out, the $1 billion for DD was well known, but this, the scope of this deal
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.280]   was not well known.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.240]   Apparently was in the face of some real heat from the Chinese authorities back in 2016.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.760]   And Alex has pointed and saying that cook, if they didn't have cook and if they don't
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.080]   have cook in the future, this kind of stuff is going to be very hard for them to navigate.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.800]   Cook along with chief operating officer.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   And here's the picture.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.400]   Jeff Williams and Lisa Jackson, government affairs head at the time met with senior government
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   officials at the country's secretive leadership compound, Zhongnan Hai.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.200]   Neither side disclosed details of the visit, but they were there in part to sign the economic
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.960]   deal, which committed Apple to aiding roughly a dozen causes favored by China, including
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.280]   a pledge to help Chinese manufacturers develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.680]   and support the training of high quality Chinese talents.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.520]   This was of course an Apple's interest anyway, because they were already menu, you know,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.960]   assembling in Foxconn, but it kind of explains apples.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   I don't know.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   Is this Andy?
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   Is this a political?
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.560]   Is this a board that politically skeevy or I mean, it's good business.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.320]   It's another piece in this conversation about Apple's relationship with China.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.400]   We started off with a story about Apple saying, wow, Russia is trying to regulate us into
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.240]   doing something we don't want to do.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.360]   We're going to sue Russia to make sure that we don't have to try to try not to do that.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.400]   When China offers the same sort of pressure, they're like send the CEO over there.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.880]   Oh my God, send the CEO over there, bring flowers.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   They like flowers.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   I don't know if they don't like fire ice cream.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   I almost love everyone loves ice cream.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.240]   These revelations are they're not necessarily shocking.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.640]   They're not necessarily hugely damaging, but we need to understand the full picture of
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.880]   Apple's relationship with China versus Apple's relationship with the US, Apple's relationship
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.960]   with the EU, Apple's relationship with everybody else.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:23.520]   The amount of power that the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party has to basically
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.280]   control every single operation that goes and goes on inside there without having to worry
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.920]   about like we can have a president that said that that hates Amazon and wants to make sure
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.720]   that Amazon doesn't get contracts.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.360]   The CEO of Amazon does not have to go hat and hand to that president and plea what can
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.920]   we do to make things to make you sign off on this thing that we would like to do that
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.720]   you're opposed to for a number of reasons.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.920]   That doesn't mean that our system is better.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.440]   I'm just comparing realities.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.880]   We actually did have that.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.360]   That happens all the time.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.960]   It's called lobbying.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.920]   So I mean, it's they're not Alex.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.280]   They're not lobbying the president.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.200]   They're lobbying Congress, the law, the Senate, the law, the law, they are they are.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   They are.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.920]   Tim Cook went to the White House to talk to Trump to make sure that he didn't get the
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.960]   that we didn't end up with the import rules.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.160]   So I mean, like he did exactly the same thing in the United States as he did in China.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.800]   No, if I could complete what I was going to say, Jeff Bezos was hated by Trump.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.000]   He did not have to change radically change how they how Amazon operates in the United
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.680]   States of America to make sure that Trump's idea of how of how Amazon should operate should
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.520]   have to go.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.480]   He also did not have to to integrate your point.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.960]   He did not have to he had the ability to basically tell the Senate or excuse me, lobby the Senate,
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   lobby Congress, lobby state legislators, please, could you change these rules so that they
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.440]   work our way?
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.720]   He didn't really have to do that.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   Okay.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.760]   But I'm saying what I'm getting at, please don't interrupt me is that in China, there
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.320]   is such a centralized form of government that if there that everybody underneath is going
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:03.480]   to be terrified of even being seen to support somebody who has been put on the naughty list
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.600]   by the government.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.240]   And so it's very, very important that Tim Cook go out there and go out there and make
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.560]   sure that these that these party officials are very, very happy.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.720]   They're going to get concessions that they can, excuse me, China is going to get concessions
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.680]   that no other country can have.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.000]   And that's even before and part of that is going to get worse and worse and worse as Apple
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.080]   becomes more and more successful in China.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.480]   It's going to be very ultimately, it's very, very easy for Apple to say, you know what,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.920]   Turkey, we're out.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   That's your, you're, you're, you're making such restrictions on how we can operate.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.160]   You're making so many demands that we change our moral stance on things that we're out.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   Congratulations.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.800]   You don't have an App Store in Turkey anymore.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.720]   That will never happen in China.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.520]   And that's why the conversation must always be where is the breaking point?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.560]   Where's the point at which Apple negotiates, tries to give the government, the Chinese
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.920]   government things that they want, but also get things that they want in return, things
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.000]   that will ultimately benefit their users in China.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.400]   And where is the line in which they simply say that there is no way we have, there's
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.480]   no way that we can pull the off switch on the App Store at the end of the day, whatever
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.600]   they demand that we do, we're going to have to do.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.680]   And that's the ongoing concern.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.080]   I'm glad that this is being documented and explained.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.200]   Again, it's not, it's not a, it's not a crisis PR moment for Apple.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.800]   It's not the thing that should cause any rational legislator in the United States of
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.160]   America, good luck with that, to wave their shoe on the podium and say something must
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.960]   be done about Apple's relationship with China, but it's, they can operate as they must do
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.600]   as a business, but it is beneficial to the public to know that, no, there are, here's
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.240]   what's going on in the inside baseball.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.600]   I will simply, and I will simply say that this is not like conventional.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.880]   Oh, well, this is all governments, all companies have to do that with international governments.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.400]   Oh, no, this thing happens in the United States all the time.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.560]   It is not the same thing because Apple is Apple and China is China.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.040]   Just like there's, it's a specific situation.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   You may do them.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   It's an articulation.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:10.560]   You may remember that round about 2016, headwinds in China, effect Tim Cook said it several
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.880]   times in the analyst's call, as I remember Renee, that yet we're having trouble in China
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.280]   where sales are plummeting in China.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.480]   They bounced back after this agreement and China is once again a big market for Apple.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.440]   According to the information, Apple's not the only company that does this, but it does
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.960]   seem to be one of the few companies that keeps it secret.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.760]   Microsoft has made a similar deal in the early 2000s.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.200]   Apple keeps everything secret.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.560]   Yeah, Cisco, Cisco sign the agreement.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   I'm going to operate.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.800]   They keep secrets for me.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.160]   They have teams keeping secrets for me.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160]   The other teams.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.040]   I mean, that's just the, Cisco signed a deal to invest $10 billion over several years back
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.640]   in 2015.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:00.200]   The Apple deal is a lot larger at 200, an estimated $270 billion.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.160]   The agreements according to the information are technically non-binding, but to your point,
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.480]   Andy, and I'm going to quote here, Chinese officials take them more seriously than officials
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   in other countries.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.480]   Yeah, but also the Chinese people.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.760]   They're more binding than you would think.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.920]   We've seen these huge incidents happen where somebody like the MBA will say something
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.840]   that China doesn't like and it's not just the China puts pressure on them.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.480]   It's that huge swaths of the population turn against that brand.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.720]   And the entire thing in China is very brand focused.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.080]   It's very face focused.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.920]   If it puts you in good esteem to have an iPhone, a lot of people are going to buy an iPhone,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.200]   but if it seemed like it's against the Chinese people, a lot of people are not going to get
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.040]   an iPhone and if you're almost balancing the Chinese government, the Chinese populace,
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.800]   and Apple is also, I think some people forget this, Apple is also a huge part of the economy
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.200]   of Guangzhou and Guangxi provinces throughout the whole manufacturing zone.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.800]   It's a mutual benefit.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.960]   Yeah, like some people like China will just cut Apple off, but I mean, those would be
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   impoverished.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.200]   It'd be way worse than it was.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   And we've wondered when the US government issued sanctions against Huawei and practically
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.240]   put them out of business, we wondered, well, why is an Apple retaliating against Apple?
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.560]   I think we now know why.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.360]   This was a part of the deal, part of the deal was.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   The amount of control that China manages to exert.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.800]   Again, we look at a lot of modern movies.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.160]   They have whole scenes in China.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.040]   They have whole subplots in both China because Tencent or someone is a massive investment.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   And none of this is bad.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   I don't want to be xenophobic.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   I'm not at all.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.120]   I spent years studying Chinese culture.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   I love it.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   But the power, the social power exerted by some governments.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   We always want to make those things.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120]   We need to keep them checked.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.360]   The people of China, the country of China, and its government.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.080]   And so when we say China, that's shorthand for the Chinese government.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.680]   And the power and how it's used.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.560]   Because there are a lot of powerful countries, but they don't only use that power in the
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   same way.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.320]   But markets like India also assert their Brazil, India.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.120]   Apple building Apple building factories.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.800]   And the other thing is that a lot of companies, including Apple, are slowly diversifying away
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.600]   from China because China is becoming less and less stable.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.080]   And so the thing is that a lot of folks, while this has been a bit of a blip, China
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.600]   has a huge set of problems that are unwrapping on their end, that they are trying to manage
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.440]   as best they can.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   This goes both ways.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.840]   So Apple can't afford to twist China too hard.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.760]   China can't afford to have Apple and everybody diversify too far as well.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.080]   They're trying to make a transition that they haven't made yet.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.600]   And I don't know if they can.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.760]   I think that China's got a lot of issues on its end to manage.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.200]   And so I think that there is a, but I will say, and I know I sound very jaded, but I
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.960]   work with a lot of governments.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:44.400]   And this is kind of part of the, this is like, anybody who wants to know how deep this goes
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.000]   just, just do a, just do a quick search on defense trade offset offsets, you know, like
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.840]   just to realize that this is a giant business, like of trillions of dollars that are moving
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.440]   around between, between this to make this work.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   And so, and this happens in nearly every major country, you know, and in every country,
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.640]   you immediately try to figure out how do I fit in?
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.000]   Well, wherever you work, I've worked in, you know, over 40 countries and many of them
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.360]   at government level.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.480]   And the thing is, is that in every place you try to figure out how do I fit in and make
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.560]   sure that I work well with the government?
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.080]   And if I'm there, you know, how do I, you know, and oftentimes I've been able to do things
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.200]   that you can't normally do because I have good relationship with the government, you
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.960]   know, and so the, so the thing is, is that those are all, that's all part of it.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.160]   And I think that what you see Apple doing in Washington, DC, what you see them do at
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.680]   local legislatures, what you see them do in China is all, you know, making sure that
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.080]   they can continue to do their business, you know, and, and I think that, and I think that
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   a lot of companies do it.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.560]   Apple happens to do it probably a little bit.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.320]   To quote the information again, Nicole Ping and an analyst at Canales says Apple is one
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.000]   of the only the one of the only international brands doing well in China right now.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.120]   Apple has continued to comply with Chinese laws.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.680]   And we've talked about this before that have led to increased censorship of its app store
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.360]   in areas like news VPNs, LGBTQ related apps.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.960]   I think that the line is the phone like we'll see when we know that, that, you know, that,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.440]   China, and that Apple has no spine is when China says, why it's in late October, last
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.560]   couple months ago, Apple said it will comply with a new Chinese data security law requiring
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   foreign companies to store more data about Chinese users in the country.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.960]   Obviously still in the cloud.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.040]   So the thing is that I think that the line for Apple and what they've shown everywhere
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.640]   in the world so far is the phone.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.200]   Well, but at that point, LinkedIn and Yahoo discontinued Chinese operations.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.800]   But Apple did not Apple moved their server, their iCloud servers to China.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.720]   So they hand off to, they hand off to the United States government as well.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.040]   So like again, I think that where we've seen them draw the hard line, the red line is at
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.920]   the phone and we'll see if Apple continues to do this in China.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.520]   Both of those things don't forget in a purchase.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   Security and our line of interest.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   No, they have though.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.520]   That's why there's doing rushes in that purchase.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.680]   And also to be fair, with some copies like LinkedIn, new regulations made it almost impossible
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.280]   for that service to operate.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:20.480]   Not because of censorship per se, but because LinkedIn is not just a resume bin.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.240]   It's also, hey, I can post something or retweet, excuse me, repost an article that I found
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.160]   or I can write something and share it with people.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.640]   Now that kind of stuff is under such tighter scrutiny under these new laws that Microsoft
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.400]   basically decided that we will keep it as sort of a job interchange thing, but it's
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.240]   going to be so difficult today and God knows how difficult it will be tomorrow to also
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.680]   be a content manager that it's just not worth our trouble for it.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:51.040]   So this is the sort of stuff that's also on my radar that, I mean, there's always a
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.200]   question of stability.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.280]   If you, if it's actually, I actually think that it's a stable government.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.000]   If I know exactly who to bribe, I know exactly like what the terms of the bribe are going
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   to be.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.520]   I know exactly what I'm going to have to give up in terms of my soul in order to get this
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.720]   bribe happen.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.920]   If that's, if that's generational throughout a government, that's actually a stable government.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.680]   And there's versions of that happening everywhere.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.960]   I know is that the problem with China and other governments is that we never know that,
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.200]   well, here's the situation right now.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.280]   Is it going to get, is, are the deals going to be changed two years from now?
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.160]   Is it going to be, is the business that we established in China that we made so much investment
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:33.600]   and where we train so many workers, we hired so many people into, into, into our company,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.920]   we contributed so much to the local government now, but now in three years from now, there
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.240]   is a new policy change that will make it impossible for us to operate or we're going
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.640]   to have to change so radically or localize so radically that's no longer going to pay
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   off for us.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.400]   That's the sort of stuff that causes a lot of instability for a company.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.160]   And that's, this is why we see a lot of companies sort of backing out, not just, not really
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.320]   because, oh, well, we're offended by the human rights, human rights angles to this, but like,
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.680]   you're making it so that we can't, we don't know if we can even operate in your country
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   anymore.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.120]   Just like if a state were to suddenly change, well, here's how, here's the new rules for,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:13.440]   here are new rules for, for, for, I don't know, environmental impact, whatever.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.320]   It's a lot of companies, this is why companies move from like California to Texas for their
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.600]   auto clients because they feel the tech situation has changed and now they can no longer do
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.480]   be as do as well in this state as they can in another state.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.040]   That's the sort of stuff that causes instability.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.240]   That's the stuff that makes things kind of random.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.960]   Kev Brewer in our discord is pointing out that last month Cook told a business forum
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:42.000]   he said that Apple has a responsibility to sell its products as many countries as possible,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.440]   including China.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   World peace.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.440]   Well, this is interesting though.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.840]   He's saying world, it's a responsibility.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.240]   No, no, it's a response.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240]   Look it.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.600]   There's a responsibility here.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.720]   World peace through world trade.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.200]   There's some, I mean, look, that's a little self-serving.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   I'm just, I don't know.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.480]   But it's not wrong either though.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.160]   I mean, if we are, if we are trading partners with the country, they're not going to, you
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.640]   know, declare war against us.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   They're, I mean, right?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   That's, that's a good point.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.560]   It also leaves an engagement for people who use it.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   People use it.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   The policy keeps you engaged.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.800]   It a little bit is like when the people in my generation gave up protesting and took
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.240]   jobs with the government saying we're going to effect change from within.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.680]   A fifth column.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.720]   But Cook has routinely said over the years that he believes in a policy of engagement
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.440]   that if Apple is not involved in a situation, they can't affect change in that situation.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.040]   And sometimes it backfires because sometimes engagement becomes a piece, but I think more
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.360]   often than not, they've managed to move the needle on a lot of environmental and political
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.840]   and sociological and civic issues by staying engaged.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.760]   I wonder so, so Apple, when it said we're going to do the, you know, in phone screen
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.760]   screening for child sexual abuse material, you know, the world went crazy.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   Apple backed down.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.560]   I don't know if they're going to ever come address it again.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.160]   But that was a case of people felt Apple going too far, getting into the phone.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.040]   Was that a lesson that Apple learned that, okay, this is really a sacrosanct.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.960]   It's not just engineering.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   It's about the people.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.360]   And when they do that in China, I mean, that was the concern a lot of people had.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.840]   The EFF said, well, now all it takes is, you know, the United, you know, Saudi Arabia
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.760]   or China or Russia come to them and say, we don't want any gay material on the phone,
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   either.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.760]   So can you do something about that?
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   It opens the door.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.520]   So maybe really this is the bright red line.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   No phone.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.080]   Well, the door was always open.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.400]   It just the people got a better sense of what these devices could do through that.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.120]   I think Apple was like, engineeringly, if Apple wanted to make a private syndicate solution,
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.880]   they did it, but they ignored all humanity.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.600]   It was just way too intrusive.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.440]   And a lot of the other arguments were not technically sound, but they were emotionally
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.160]   valid because it made people feel like Apple was intrudious.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.680]   Like, no, no, no, the police are going to come to your house.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.880]   They'll go to the police station.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.640]   The police are coming to your house and nobody wants that.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640]   Nobody wants that.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.680]   Even if it means that you don't have to have every like it was a misstep in terms of how
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.280]   the understood the situation, but I think it was a cautionary moment for them understanding
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.280]   that there is this sort of reaction out there.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.240]   And if not, I don't think it's going to change their stance on privacy, but it's going to
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.000]   change their stance in how they both implement and communicate, especially privacy going
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   forward.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.440]   Well, and the two, the two chinks in Apple's privacy armor is terrorism and pedophiles,
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   right?
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.480]   So that's the, that's where the government always talks about.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   We need to get into the phone.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.840]   So I think that they're trying to solve that problem is related to them trying to actually
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.960]   protect the privacy of their, of their entire infrastructure.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.640]   But but I think that it was misguided.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.920]   Like it was, you know, and so I think that I can see why they did it.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   Oof.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   Dangerous.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.320]   I would have heard iPhone sales.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.400]   So they couldn't, they just couldn't do it.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   All right.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   Let's take a little break.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.280]   I will have an Amoose Bush with a Mac rumor and iPad rumor coming up.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   So don't worry.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.000]   It's not going to be all politics and courtroom activity.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.880]   Our show today brought to you by AT and T. It's 2021.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.760]   You can, you can buy a self-driving car.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.360]   You can eat burgers made out of plants.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   You can even fly to space in rocket ships or near space if you've have the money for
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   it.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.480]   So if you can do all this futuristic stuff today, at least your phone could do the very
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.440]   least is stream a show without buffer and lag over and over again.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:31.720]   And for that, you should have AT and T five G AT and T five G is fast, reliable and secure.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.440]   Makes it easy to download entertainment in a flash, stay connected across the city.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.280]   It helps keep your device protected even from spam calls.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.800]   If you want to make sure your phone service keeps up with what you need from it, get AT
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   and T five G.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   It's not complicated.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.400]   Five G requires a compatible plan may not be in your area.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.760]   C AT and T.com slash five G for you.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.360]   Five G F O R Y O U for details.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.080]   Thank you AT and T for your support of Mac break weekly.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:12.680]   You know, it's a rumor, but in late December, the best you can do is just hope, pray that
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   you're going to get a rumor.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.720]   This is from Mark Gurman's power on.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.440]   Before we start this, yes, Leo, I want to do this is a constant objection.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.160]   I'm making I'm raising it again.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.800]   Mark Gurman reports for Bloomberg when he reports for Bloomberg, he says sources familiar
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.280]   with the matter and he has like a full report when he does his newsletter, he says, I think
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.680]   Apple might do this and people still don't differentiate between the two.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.440]   He's very careful with his language.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.880]   So when he says, I think it's him, it's his opinion.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.400]   It's not like a source report when he says people familiar with the matter, then it's
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.200]   like he has actual information on it.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.400]   I just want to keep making that.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   Okay.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   So good.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.400]   So this is from power on.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   This is from his newsletter.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.760]   This is an I think not sources tell me.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.960]   I have to think that he thinks stuff because he's hearing from sources, but no, you say
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   that's not the case.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.360]   This could be completely like sometimes it's based on sources, but Mark also like Mark,
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.520]   like we on the show a lot of times, Andy or Alex, I'll say we think Apple should do
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   this.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.000]   I think Apple would do this based on my experience covering Apple for 10 years.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.120]   I think they should do this, but you know, that's our opinion.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.520]   It's not like somebody came and told us that they were going to do it.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.880]   And Mark is very good about saying when somebody came and told them what they're doing.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.360]   He says, you know, well, then we won't belabor this.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.880]   Just Mark thinks Mark thinks based, you know, I mean, he's an informed observer.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   Some of this is really good.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.680]   Some of it I think he's going to get his heart broken on, but I think some of it is
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   really small.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   Well, good.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   Okay.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.960]   What's going to stick redesigned iPad Pro?
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   That seems fair.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.000]   I mean, it's been a while, right?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.600]   Highly reported.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.040]   High and I Mac, obviously, that's an I Mac Pro, right?
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   That's the iPad Pro.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   We can stick with that for a second.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.480]   That's interesting because the M2 is a given.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.200]   The M2 is going to go into the MacBook Air is going to go into the low end MacBook Pro.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   It's going to go into the next iPad.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   But the idea that it's going to have MagSafe is really interesting to me because nobody
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.040]   has deployed MagSafe through aluminum, which is what the iPad currently has on the back.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.360]   And they've only done it through glass.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.240]   And Google had, I think, an interesting solution where they had sort of an area that was glass
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.880]   in the metal and it was hidden.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   Right.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   And so I'm wondering what Apple's going to do because-
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.960]   What if it's MagSafe in the same way?
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.080]   What if it's MagSafe in the same way that the laptops do MagSafe?
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   What if it's a connector?
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.480]   That could be another way to do it, too.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.800]   Or it wouldn't be like it wouldn't just sit on a T-charger.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   Right.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   And when the back it's supposed to be shiny anyway and the Apple can definitely do the
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   material.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   Yeah, make it glass.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.440]   It's also a really great- I love thinking about ideas like this because there are ideas
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.560]   that work impeccably on a laptop like MagSafe.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.520]   Again, we can have disagreements about whether it kicks out of my MacBook too easily or not.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.000]   But it's a really good idea and it works great.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.560]   Now we think about, well, how about we put MagSafe on a phone or on a tablet?
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   And that's when we have to start really picking this thing apart and thinking about what problem
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.520]   are we trying to solve by putting MagSafe here?
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.760]   And it means that if I- what I love about the magnetic mounts for these devices as it
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.960]   is, is that if I have a stand next to my display and these are going to be coming- a stand
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.080]   next to your display is going to become a lot more important and a lot more useful once
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.880]   the integration between the keyboard of your mouse and your iPad on your desktop is going
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.400]   to be even better and better.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.920]   It means that I just slap it on there.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   Boom.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.920]   It's really good.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   It's stuck there for good.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.240]   It's really interesting to have the idea that no way will also give you your power hook
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.640]   up at the same time.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:36.480]   But we also have fails like- or excuse me, my opinion fails like Face ID on the iPad where
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.680]   so many times I'm like, I have to pick it up and turn it a certain way because unfortunately,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.280]   because like I'm lying in bed and reading, my arm is blocking whatever it needs to see
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.080]   in order to verify my face or I have to double tap at some point to verify a purchase.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.880]   But I have to use this arm, not this arm because this arm is going to block the Face ID stuff
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.040]   because I got it in landscape mode.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.480]   So I like this rumor.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:08.680]   I like how simple it will make to simply have my really nice 12.9 inch iPad Pro as a secondary
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:14.880]   display and as a different depository for apps and docs on my desktop setup and the
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.800]   modern miracle of just I just grab it, pop it off.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.560]   I don't have to disconnect anything or unplug anything.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.320]   I just grab it and go and suddenly it's an iPad again.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.720]   That's a great idea.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   So this is really marks-
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:31.280]   This is really marks Christmas list of like end of the year.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.720]   Let's look at next year.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.600]   So I think the products are solid.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.720]   I think like him wanting glances back on the Apple watches where he's going to get his
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   hand.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.520]   So the overall outline of it sounds right.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   We'd all agree.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   The details where you know, they may or may not be true.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   He says, I just don't want to see unbox therapy.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.920]   It's like bending an iPad because of the Maxxivness.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   Stop it.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   Stop it.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Stop it.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   I just don't want to see that.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.400]   I had my own soul as a pacemaker hold an iPad next to his heart for three days to find
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   out if it affected his company.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   Let me say this, Renee.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.720]   You're the only YouTuber I trust period at this point.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   Oh, thank you.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.320]   So just, you know, take it all with a grain of salt.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   They will never let you.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.960]   Well, you know, they all are just trying to generate hits and they don't really seem
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:26.320]   to have any underlying ethical, you know, it's like it's funny.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.440]   Lisa and I were talking about the fact that CNN fired Chris Cuomo because he helped his
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:38.000]   brother out and Lisa said, you know, this is so old fashioned.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.760]   Nobody cares about journalistic ethics anymore.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.240]   Just well, and she sort of run.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   They won.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   They kind of won Andy.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   I hate to say it.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.480]   We're all timers.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.080]   I believe in it still.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.160]   You know, I understand why you can't cover something that you're in bed with, you know,
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.240]   that doesn't work.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.080]   You know, and people need to trust you.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.480]   But apparently the audience has gotten sophisticated enough that they know now to take everything
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.040]   with a grain of salt and, you know, consider this source.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.400]   Or the opposite or they just they don't care anymore because they're so based out in
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   that bad for us.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   They just believe it all and it's over.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   Okay.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.080]   I mean, we talked about the before, like when we were younger, Leo, there was like one
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.160]   pile on all incident and the company almost went bankrupt, one, one whiff of political
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.320]   and propriety and you could never run for office.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.640]   Now people are like apologizing every day.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.200]   And companies are like, we're already floating phone back.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.960]   I had to give up his run for president because there was a picture of him dandling some honey
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.200]   on his knee on a yacht.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   Monkey.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   There was a Swiss boat thing too.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   Right.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   I mean, like the whole of the whole.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   And that was it.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   It was all over the career was all over.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.800]   And now what do you want to do whatever you want?
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.720]   Like it's that on your eighth murder and you're still not resigning.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.920]   Like it's just it's it's it's it's it's again, like it's a new world exploding phone back.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.680]   No, I'm like, I have all been shouting at the sky.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.320]   There's nothing that I get the clouds and nothing much we could do about it.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.840]   But anyway, point well taken that, you know, take this with a grain of salt and I think
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   it's our job.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   And I think we're we're credible and good enough at it to you just did a great job saying,
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.400]   well, maybe, but there's the issues with wireless charging, for instance, on an iPad
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.400]   Pro.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.800]   I think we it's time for an iPad Pro.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.920]   It's just a simple schedule.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.920]   Yes.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.400]   Redesign is the question.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.320]   And yeah, it's about time for a redesign as well.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.600]   You know, maybe a rounded corners.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   Who knows?
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   I don't know.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   Apple has redesigned the MacBook Air.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.840]   We've been hearing rumors about this also for 2022 in colors.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.040]   I'm hoping and will and will and this sounds like will this have so this is the really
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.640]   the interesting underlying question.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.200]   You started it.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.520]   Someone is tied to the A14, right?
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.720]   It is an A14 basically.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   Yes.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.120]   The iPhone 13 has a 15 in it.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   Yes.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.720]   So will we see an A15 M2, I guess, or something like that?
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   Yes.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   This year.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   People will call for sure.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   In 2022.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   And we might see it in a MacBook Air.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.280]   Would that make here's my real question.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.160]   I just bought an M1 Pro.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.200]   Will it make the MacBook Air faster than the one?
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.880]   So this is the thing.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.920]   People had that same issue when the iPad Pro came out with the A12Z in 2020 because
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.360]   it was already in a 13 out there like well, does this mean the iPhone is faster and it
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:26.120]   will be faster in some well, the efficiency cores are about 20% faster in a 15 generation
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   IP.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.800]   The performance cars are about 10% faster, but they're way more efficient.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.040]   Like Apple actually changed the names from Firestorm and Icestorm to Avalanche and Blizzard
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.440]   to just sort of describe how cold this thing runs, which is not really important at all
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.600]   in a MacBook Pro, but it's really important.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.640]   It's something like a MacBook Air or a phone.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   No fan in that.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.880]   You want it to, yeah, our phone too.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.520]   The graphics cores are more powerful.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.960]   They actually throttle down on the iPhone.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.360]   They're so powerful.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.400]   And the report is that we're going to go from 8 to 10 graphics cores in the next version
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.560]   of the M1, like the M2 for the iPad.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.600]   So it'll have better graphics performance.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.680]   It won't have like 16 or 32 GPU cores like you have in the MacBook Pro.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.280]   So it's designed for ultra low power efficiency and it wants to make that better.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   It's not going to touch at all with how we make a MacBook Air in color sound damn sexy.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   Super sexy.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:24.960]   I think that I'll be interested to see if they include things like the ProRes chip in
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.560]   the air, which they mean.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.720]   That's on a 15 already.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   Oh, it is.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   It's on the right.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.760]   It's on the iPhone.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.960]   So you get it for free.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   It's amazing.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   It's amazing.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   Well, I was talking to my son because he wants to start shooting 8K video for his TikToks.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   I don't know why.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   As you should.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   As one should.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   Okay, I'll tell him.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   Absolutely.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.800]   And he's about to buy the MacBook Pro 16 and they said, and what the guy?
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.240]   He's using a 5D and an R6.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.560]   You should get a black magic 12K.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.560]   I know he should.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   I know.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.560]   I'll tell him next time.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.560]   Or tell him 8K 120.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   You know, I told him.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   That's the one.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.160]   Don't spend all your money.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   Save it.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.360]   Don't just because you got it doesn't mean you should all put it all in production.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.760]   What was that Vincent de la Fardier?
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   Ricky filmed New York with it.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   It was three black.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   It was three red 8K.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.560]   So it was 24K fused.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.760]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.920]   But it's TikTok.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   Let's be honest.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   Okay.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.120]   So anyway, that's not just neither here nor there.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.440]   Where was I?
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.280]   So I said, yeah, get it.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   Oh, I know.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   It's at Apple Store.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.640]   He said, oh, don't get the Max.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.200]   The Pro is plenty for what you want to do.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:39.360]   He's using Premiere to do the editing and probably he's using After Effects, a few other
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.520]   things like that.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.880]   I said, no, he's crazy.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.760]   I said Max out the RAM and get the Max.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.880]   Max out the processor, Max out the RAM because you can't upgrade it.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   Right?
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   Max has to render it.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   Time is everything.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   Well, that's what I said.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   It's not going to be.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.040]   It's not that it won't work because for instance, it has this ProRes chip.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.440]   So playback is going to be fine.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.440]   It's the rendering.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.880]   It's got double the ProRes engines on the Max.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.160]   Like the battery life will be worse just because there's more silicon to light up.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.720]   Yeah, I don't think you're changing time for battery life.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.160]   So anyway, once you get into real production, it's all about time.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.520]   It's operator time.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.520]   That's everything.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.520]   Well, he's self-employed.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   So he's, he was, he texted me at 1 40 a.m.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.040]   I mean, you can just see the blur in his eyes saying, I mean, you told me it would be
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040]   there would be suffering.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.120]   I mean, the whole thing is, is that is, is that when you, when you talk about time when
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.600]   it comes to production, you know, no one ever finishes a project.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.920]   They just run out of time.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.880]   You know, and so you have to ship.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.440]   And so when you have something that is way more fluid and way faster, you do more, you
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.080]   don't, you don't work less.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.880]   You just do more with the time that you have.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   You make it cooler.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.840]   You add a couple of extra bills and whistles because, because you have more time given back.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.200]   If you're passionate about what you do, you're always going to just keep turning it to 11.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   And that 11 just keeps moving.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.800]   Yeah, you're buying time.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.600]   In fact, I'm texting him that right now.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   You're buying time.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.360]   I'm like, says you are buying.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.360]   Right.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.760]   Anyway, but I do love the idea because I like the MacBook Air.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.320]   I like the form factor a lot.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.720]   I have to say, I bought the bottom of the line M1 Pro, the 14 inch and it's great.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.560]   It's perfect for what I do because I'm not doing video editing.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.640]   I'm not doing 4K or 8K or anything like that.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   But for coding.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   The pro is about your life.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.680]   Oh, it's just, it's just, and it replaced the M1 13 inch, you know, the last year's M1.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.360]   And it was a, and at least I got the new M1 upgraded from an Intel MacBook Pro.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.400]   Everybody's happy.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.560]   And it's just, it's a stunning machine.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.400]   But I kind of like the idea of Macbook.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.400]   It's air.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   I really do.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.440]   Well, the air is going to be like a whole different thing.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   It's going to be smaller again.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.080]   I think it'll be very similar to the 12 inch MacBook and it'll be colorful like the iMac
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   was.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.240]   So you're going to have the best of that product.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   Probably it's an awesome product, right?
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.400]   Well, it's going to be more expensive, but the Macbook air is, it's not like this, this
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.600]   problem where it started off super expensive, but then Apple got it down to 999.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.480]   And then everyone starts thinking the air means cheap when the air really always meant
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   mobile.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.680]   And there's some rumors suggesting they don't even call it the MacBook air.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.520]   It's just going to be the MacBook again.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.760]   But it's this idea of having this.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   That's a good idea.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   That's a good idea.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.240]   And with Intel, the Y series just could never deliver like Apple had to wait years to get
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   retina on it.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   It was awful.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.240]   It had to wait forever to get the power.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   It was always an anemia process.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   That's the upgrade.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.240]   And Lisa made is from the Y to the M1 and she's blown away.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.160]   Yeah, it's night and day and now we're going to have all of that in a new enclosure because
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   I think sometimes people forget too that the low power doesn't just mean long battery
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   life.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   It means that you can make enclosures.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.160]   You can never make before.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.680]   I was watching Dave 2D's video.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.360]   He was trying to put the latest Alder Lake in a mini tower and he had to water cool it.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   Like not even though.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.200]   No, body like we have a name for Intel's a 12th generation processor.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.600]   It's called Skalder Lake.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.920]   Okay, just let's agree on that.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   It's a little hot.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.360]   Like you might say like that doesn't matter.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.080]   But if Apple wants to make an iMac, they can't.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.320]   There's no way Alder Lake would fit in any iMac enclosure they've ever made.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   Never mind the new one.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.200]   No, I don't think anybody doubts Apple's move at this point.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   It's funny.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.560]   It took a little while for the go of power PC to Intel, but boy, this is like so night
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.720]   and day clear.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.200]   Well, and the funny thing is that you know, I really thought, well, we'll wait until the
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.480]   third or fourth version before I before I buy it.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.280]   We'll just keep on buying Intel versions.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   Now, like I won't buy an Intel version.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   All right.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   I see him on sale.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   I'm like, yeah, I'm not interested.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.080]   I came along for the ride.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   Okay, good.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.840]   As long as your software has moved over, you're fine.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.200]   And in most cases, it's very few cases now where it's not.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.480]   The other thing that's really a lot of credit to Apple for Rosetta too, that they have made
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.720]   this transition as easy as possible.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.720]   They did it once before.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   Yeah, they've done it before.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.040]   But I think they and if you're on metal, it's faster.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.440]   That's the thing that blows my mind is like, because Nvidia always wanted to abstract away
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   the computers into dumb beige boxes.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.080]   They just hosted CUDA cores and Apple's like, no, we're going to abstract away the GPU
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.400]   so that we can just swap them out.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.000]   It's not going to be a big deal to you.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.600]   And that turned out to work.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.760]   Because if you have like a piece of Intel software that's written to metal, it is so
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.000]   much faster on Apple GPUs than it ever was on the Intel integrated and even the low end
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.440]   AMD stuff.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:13.360]   Gurman says a revamped high end iMac with Apple Silicon.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.480]   We thought that the iMac Pro.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.640]   New entry level MacBook Pro, that's a surprise.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   What would that be?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.200]   A new entry level MacBook Pro.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   I don't know what that would be.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.640]   I put the video up on that today.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.880]   So that's the one that Phil Schiller announced back in 2016.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.160]   That's for MacBook Air customers.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.760]   I just want a little bit more.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.880]   So it's going to be M2, not M2 Pro or M2 Macs or anything like that.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.420]   And it's basically a MacBook Air that can sustain heavy workloads longer and have a
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.720]   longer battery life.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.160]   So this is what the M2 is going to give them is a broader range of choices.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.760]   An Air Pro or a Pro Air depending on your phrase.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.320]   I will say it's not as bad as it was in the 90s, but I start feeling like even I start
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.800]   looking at going, oh, I don't know which one I want.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.480]   And as soon as I start squinting at it, I'm like, oh, maybe they're making too many
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   excuse.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.320]   Like, you know, that's what Steve Jobs just famously said.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.120]   And you're kind of like, you know, just keep them.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   I don't know.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.120]   I would have less cues.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.120]   Okay.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.120]   I would have the two sides of the air.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.240]   Well, that's why taking away air makes sense.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.280]   You got your MacBook and you got your MacBook Pro.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.800]   And maybe there's a MacBook Air and then a little bit higher MacBook, you know, the
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:26.080]   MacBook, former MacBook Air, the laptop formerly named known as a MacBook Air and a little
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   bit higher MacBook.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.240]   Well, they're going to keep that around because the new one's not going to be that low of
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.240]   price.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.600]   So they're going to have the M1 MacBook Air at $9.99 and then the M2 MacBook Air at like
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.760]   usually starts at around $1,200 then goes down over a couple of years.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   Okay.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.960]   So the Mac Pro, according to German, this is again, I think you're right here projection,
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.000]   but a safe bet because it's due.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Apple said three years.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.440]   This is year three next year and a new Mac mini in the works for next year.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.440]   That all makes sense.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.000]   I mean, this isn't anything people are going to go.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.560]   Whoa, I can't believe it.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:05.240]   For the Apple Watch three new models and updated watch SE and updated standard model.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.640]   I like this third one though, and I wonder if this is his guess or from information he's
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:17.280]   received a ruggedized version aimed at extreme sports athletes to compete with say the Garmin
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   four runner.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   Yeah, good.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   Yeah, that was rumored for last year.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.280]   But not pushed.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   That would be very interesting.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.720]   The fact that there's such a market for for protective bands and protective screen covers
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.400]   for this beautifully elegantly designed tiny thing that people wanted to look like a Casio
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.520]   G shock that should that was the big warning sign for everybody.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.400]   And also a sign of how successful this thing is.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.920]   I mean, one of my favorite.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.400]   I only have three watches, but one of my favorite is the G shock because my God, it is 10 years
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.440]   old, still working perfectly.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.760]   No dings, no cracks, no nothing.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.320]   If I were to it's it's also cool.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320]   Let's face it.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   I will say that it looks.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.480]   It goes with your tactical pants.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.280]   Honestly, I'm going to shock.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.840]   I'm not, you know, I'm not a Navy SEAL, but you can.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   But I love how it looks.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.720]   I'm giving up, suiting up in the morning, like the scene from like a Batman movie.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.360]   Yeah, you look like a Navy SEAL.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.760]   Like your day job, you know, might be a Navy SEAL, you know, who knows?
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   I don't know.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.240]   A technology seal, sir.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.680]   I'll be I'll be I T for the Navy seals.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.040]   He I don't know if you want that job.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   I really don't.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.480]   I think you have to go in the field if you're an IT.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.960]   My laptop got shot again.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.280]   I don't want to divert the entire topic.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.080]   I will say that in the movie, the character, the action movies, the characters, I always
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.040]   wanted to be like, I want to be the guy in the van.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.720]   I want to be the guy saying, okay, big, okay.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   I'm a 12.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   You're a man.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   You want to be sparky.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.480]   No, no, no, I'm I'm not I'm not not the person.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.840]   The person in like the the logo list baseball cap who's monitoring like 18 screens and lots
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.880]   of things like graphs and yeah, I'm saying, yeah, okay, I'm getting a really I'm getting
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   a really bad.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.440]   A MP MP on the 12 on the 12 meter band.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.080]   Watch out there could be cameras on you.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   That's what I want.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.480]   I don't want to be the guy with the gun who gets shot at.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   I want to be an actor.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.000]   It's not Robert in your not Robert Bingo bingo bingo bingo.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.240]   So this is the quote and I'm really curious because it didn't sound didn't doesn't ring
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   true for me.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:23.480]   2021 was a modest year for Apple product updates, but it expect a wider range of new
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.480]   products in 2022.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.040]   Really? Really? Was this a modest year?
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.720]   No, I don't think this was a modest year.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   M1 I'm back.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.720]   M1 pro M1 Max.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   I'm a pro with many LED.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.520]   I still think I still think that I when you see what Apple has queued up.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.240]   It feels modest because you can see where to it's coming.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.880]   You're like they're like you're just realizing they're just kind of planting everything down.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.040]   And so like this was, you know, it's like, you know, we're going to reduce it.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.280]   You know, they're going to move fast, not slow like before.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.200]   And so that's the thing that I think he's talking to is that, I mean, especially when
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.440]   you talk about, you know, potentially other wearables and so on and so forth, I think
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.200]   that, you know, things can get really interesting.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   M1 Max.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   Do you have a headset?
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   Is that got your eye, Alex?
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   I mean, the rumors.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   Literally.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.840]   So, you know, the, the, the, I mean, the, the rumors seem to be that it's bubbling near
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.840]   the surface.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.560]   So, so I think that that'll be really interesting to see.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.480]   And I, and I think that marches where we're going to see March and June are going to be
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   really interesting.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.840]   But I think that will probably, you know, traditionally Apple does kind of an education
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:30.960]   focused March event with a new iPad and, you know, possibly a new Mac mini and, and, and
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.640]   then we may see what I'm really interested.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.760]   We'll know that we're close when, again, when Apple opens up USDZ across more apps and
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.480]   so on and so forth and really makes them available because that really sets the stage for.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.120]   Does it need a new name, Alex?
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   It's like he was.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.920]   Is that not friendly enough?
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.080]   It needs some Apple name like Apple 3D.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.560]   Like, but probably they don't want it to be that.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.400]   So I think the part, the part of the reason you leave it as USDZ is because it's an open
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   format.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   Stand up.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   Everyone can use it.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.680]   You know, it's people in the industry know it as USD with a zip, you know, zip to USD
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   is USDZ.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.920]   And so I think Apple, I don't think wants to change it because they don't want to take
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.160]   ownership over it or people will stop developing for it, you know, because it is an incredible
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.160]   format.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   It was developed by Pixar.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.680]   It's the only thing Apple added to it was the zip, you know, and so there's, there's
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.320]   a USD, USD, USD, two flavors of USD that are out there.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.980]   And the problem right now is that they're not, it's not well supported, but, but as it,
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.360]   you can see everybody's working on it because of Apple and it'll probably become the standard
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.200]   because of Apple.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:41.680]   And so so I think that it'll be, but as we see that expand, it'll be really interesting.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   I am so excited about year two or Agassier three of the M1.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   I mean, I just want.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:51.880]   The funny thing is, is that I think in post COVID that most of us in office hours, at least
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.480]   aren't talking about Mac books.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.320]   Like, no one's like, it was a handful of people's head is really fast.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.920]   Everyone wants like we were just talking about everybody wants Mac minis.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.560]   Like everyone's like, when am I getting the new M2 Mac mini?
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.960]   Because what the Mac mini did, what's changed for it after all these years, it used to be
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.000]   this kind of little piece of glue that you use for a little extra apps or to glue things
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   together.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.840]   It wasn't very powerful, but it was, it was rack mountable and you could do reasonably
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.160]   good things with it.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.520]   It's now like a little workstation.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   I'm using resolve.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.800]   I was rendering stuff in resolve last night with 8K files on my Mac mini, you know, and
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.680]   not even a 16 gig that was having trouble with my 16 gig.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.280]   So the 8 gig is sitting there rendering away, you know.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.200]   And, and so the thing is, is that it is super powerful.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.160]   So it's become this workstation.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.400]   And so suddenly everyone, since a lot of people aren't traveling as much, they're kind
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.720]   of like, well, do I really need them?
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.640]   Like for me, I don't need another Mac book, you know, and so, so I don't, I mean, I have
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   a Mac.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.800]   I don't need another Mac book, but I can always, you know, I, but my whole thing is I have
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   lots of laptops.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.120]   If I need to go out somewhere in the, you know, I can take one with me and check my
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.360]   email and do the things that I need to do, but when I do production, I'm home enough now.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   Right.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   That doesn't matter.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.120]   You know, and, and so I think that, that I think it's going to be interesting.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:08.640]   I think that the Mac Pro is going to need to be just screaming, which is, it makes me,
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.000]   you know, excited to buy Mac Pro, but, but it, you know, to compete with its own products.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.600]   It's not going to, I don't think the Mac Pro is going to compete with any workstation.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.520]   It's going to be competing with its own Mac mini.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.720]   You know, it's, that's like running really fast and really inexpensive.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.880]   And so to, to ask for the big bucks, which I think they will, I think we're going to
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.240]   see just an insanely fast machine.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.960]   But what, one of the things that we've been talking about as a, as a, as an underscore
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.960]   is that it's important for Apple as big as in success.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:40.760]   What's there are they really do have to have a portfolio of desktop, of desktop computers,
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.320]   meaning that's not enough for them to have their own quirky aesthetics, not enough for
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.560]   them to have their own point of view of things.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.400]   The thing is people want a, people, there are people, the market for laptops includes
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:55.040]   people who want something as light and portable as possible.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.960]   People want things that are, want laptops that are affordable.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:02.360]   People want things that are, that will sacrifice both of those things in order to have the
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.840]   most powerful thing imaginable.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.360]   So, which is why it's, it's, it's a problem that Apple needs to solve if all they have
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.120]   are two of those three zones for the desktops.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.520]   They, one of the, the Mac mini fulfills a really vital function, which is that, thank
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.520]   you Apple.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.120]   That's a beautiful display.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   It's a lovely display.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.320]   You should be proud of that display.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.840]   I'm glad you're proud of that display.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.080]   I don't need that display.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.120]   I'm a, I'm a, I'm a small company that has lots of displays that work just fine for
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   the stuff we do.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.240]   We just want the thing you plug into the display.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.680]   And sometimes we need that to be just basic table stakes CPU power because we have someone
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:41.160]   at the front desk that's just pretty much managing, managing aspects of the office.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.000]   We need the screaming fast ones out the, down the back for the people who are doing production
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.840]   related things and the Mac mini covers so many of those bases really, really well.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   So this is why it's, it's a gap of, there's, there's, there's a gap in the line when Apple
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.240]   only has like their basic proof of concept Mac mini out.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:02.720]   And this is why the, when they come out with the M2 Mac mini next year, that's going to
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.200]   be a very, very significant moment in this transition.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.160]   I think it's going to be equally as important in terms of again, having a portfolio that
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.960]   that causes Apple to be still considered a real computer company.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.160]   I think it's going to be just as important as the workstation grade devices and stuff
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.800]   that I don't care that has eight fans.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.120]   I don't care that actually it kind of levitates that there's, there, there, they're turning
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   so fast to get this, this processing job done fast.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   That's good.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.120]   That's great.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   That's impressive.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.800]   But we also need that commodity computer so that I need to buy a six pack of these
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   to upgrade my office.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.480]   And that's what the Mac mini is going to do.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:40.000]   Well, and I, and I, I've now bought seven of them because you're just like, oh, I need
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   something to do something.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Of the M1 Mac mini?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   You bought seven?
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Yeah, I have seven.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Nice.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   Yeah, the company, the company's bought 15.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Oh, and I know.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.680]   And I personally bought seven.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   Wow.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.360]   So it's so between the company and I, there's 22 of them will float around.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:58.920]   And, and it's just because they are so useful, you know, like you, you know, and we run office
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   hours, you know, on it.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.440]   And, and, and there, and there's like, I have these little, I, I have these little, I
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.000]   have lots of them are the eight gig ones because I just don't, I don't need the 16 gig for
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.800]   most of them for what they're doing.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.400]   I'm still getting used to the fact that they could be powerful.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.640]   I just need them for these little things.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.480]   But we're running like four 1080p streams out of every Mac mini and it's running at
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   like 20%.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   Like it's like, yeah, sure.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   Wow.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   So powerful.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   All right.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.760]   Well, we're excited about the future.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:31.320]   If this was, if this was a kind of slow year, I can't wait to see what 2022 brings.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.040]   You know what that's always, that's already an upgrade over 2020 where it's like, we're,
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.240]   we're not resigned to the future.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.640]   We're excited about the future.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   Wow.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.520]   They did it on iOS today, earlier today.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:50.280]   And I recommend that you watch Micah and Rosemary talk about the App Store Awards of 2021.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.720]   Apple does, you know, they, they, they take an opportunity at the end of the year to talk
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.720]   about the best.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.440]   We talked last week about the best apps and best music and all that.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:02.760]   This time the App Store award winners, the, should I just run through them?
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   Why not?
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:10.320]   For a, for a deeper dive, watch iOS today, TOCA life world from TOCA Boca is the app of
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.880]   the year on the iPhone.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.960]   This is a game kit for kids.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.800]   I, you know, they're, they're fun.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.520]   They've been, TOCA has been around for a while with a lot of big hits.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:25.120]   So the, I'm glad to say the iPad app of the year is LumaFusion from Luma Touch.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.720]   I think everybody would agree that.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.280]   Just deserves it.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   What a powerful application.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   Like just a minute.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.760]   I mean, this was a tough category though.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.240]   I mean, there's a Pixelmator Pro.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.280]   There's a lot of, I mean, Pixelmator Photo.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.080]   There's a lot of good choices in this category.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:42.840]   The big thing, the big thing with, with LumaFusion is that it is built from the ground up to
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.600]   be a touch application that manages video and, and there's no, it wasn't ported somewhere.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   It wasn't figured out.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   Like how are we going to do it?
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.600]   It just built for that purpose.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.600]   Just an amazing application.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   Highly agree.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:56.600]   And boy, the other thing that's great.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.600]   Who was it?
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.200]   Somebody was asking me what to use.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:03.400]   Oh, I think it was on the radio show for photo editing.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.840]   I said, instead in lieu of Lightroom and Photoshop, I said, boy, you're really lucky.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.960]   I'm both the Mac and the iOS.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.120]   There are some really strong choices.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:17.400]   Pixelmator, Luma, there's just some really good dark room.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.840]   We're in a wonderful time.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.000]   You don't have to buy Lightroom and Photoshop anymore.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   You really don't.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.920]   And the price is like 35 bucks.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:25.920]   You know, amazing.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:31.200]   On top of all of that, can I just put a round-rof for just the iPad Pro as a platform?
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.400]   The other had a general as a platform.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:38.760]   Again, I spent, I just came home last night from like four days in New York City and I
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   got the apps.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.640]   I absolutely got the photo work for work for.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.600]   I've always dreamed of on my iPad Pro.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   I come, I get back to the hotel.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.760]   I get back to my room at night, dump my pictures because this has a buttload of storage.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.680]   I can just dump the entire card.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:59.880]   Now I'm doing my photo triage of these two or 300 pictures looking at beautiful 8x10 color
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:05.040]   glosses on this gorgeous screen, which allows me to see every single detail where, no,
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.640]   this one, the focus is almost perfect on this next one.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.640]   It's perfect.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   Great, except that one.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.000]   And then because of the power of the CPU and the power of these apps, not even have to
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   worry.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.040]   I'm going to, boy, as soon as I get home to my MacBook and my desktop Photoshop, I'm
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   definitely going to work on that.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.960]   So no, why not work on that right now?
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.920]   Then I also have this Apple Pencil, which is a few years ago, three or four years ago,
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.480]   I was thinking about, well, maybe I should actually, it's time for me to actually buy
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.040]   a Wacom tablet because I'm doing a lot more Photoshop work.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   Now that would be a step backwards.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.840]   Why would I want to draw on the tablet?
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.640]   Because again, I'm not going to be able to afford the kind with the built-in screen,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.280]   when I can actually manipulate this thing directly.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.520]   Again, it's for people who enjoy photography, let alone professionals.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.600]   It is worth twice.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.800]   It seems like it's worth twice the price because it is exactly an invisible but power
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.680]   enhancing conduit between the pictures I took and the pictures that I want to be able to
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.600]   keep and display with their...
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.920]   It's such a perfect, perfect system that I can't recommend highly enough to people who
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.640]   enjoy taking and working with photos.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.280]   It's amazing.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.360]   Moving on to the Mac app of the year.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.200]   I don't know if you guys have tried craft from Lookie Labs Limited I have because I'm
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.960]   a constant quest to find the best note-taking app.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   This is a really...
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:25.040]   There is no best note-taking app.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.440]   There's just your next note-taking app.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.720]   It's a disease.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   You're right.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   This one is beautiful.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.400]   They've done a really nice job.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.040]   It's kind of like Notion for the Mac.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.760]   But I like it because your data is local.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.400]   I wish it were cross-platform.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.640]   It would be an option for me if it were.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:47.160]   But for Mac specific users, this is a gorgeous tool.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.600]   Very nice.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.280]   Craft from Lookie Labs.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.360]   The Apple TV app of the year I'm not familiar with because I'm not a big ultimate fighting
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.000]   championship expert.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.920]   But from the days in group, and that's what this is, is streaming video of battles of
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   some kind.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.760]   Looks like there's some football there as well, boxing.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.320]   They're not streaming Jake Paul, I'm happy.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.080]   Fighting, that kind of thing.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.360]   I think you'll agree, everybody will agree that the app of the year for the watch is
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.360]   Carrot Weather.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.280]   The snaughtiest weather app ever.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:26.720]   I was about to say they picked such a nice, intense participation.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.160]   Yeah, they probably did.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.160]   There is a setting in Carrot not to be snarky.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.160]   Not to be snarky.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.160]   Clearly.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160]   I've never seen that part.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.960]   Clearly they have chosen the non-snaughtier face.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.600]   Because usually it says...
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   Hey, Poophead.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.480]   It's not like you're going to go out to date tonight anyway.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.320]   Who cares if it's for any outside?
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.320]   Which is always fun.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.320]   Always fun.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.840]   Not someone who's so knows it completed any of their fitness bands of like eight years.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.440]   Okay, that was a little bit of a prayer.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.600]   Really really found a niche, didn't they?
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600]   It's snotty app.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.280]   Who would have thought it, right?
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.520]   That that would be a whole category.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   But they make the best...
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520]   They probably went to that.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   There's that...
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.680]   Remember that diner in Vancouver that they just...
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   They're snotty to you the whole time.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   I don't know if you ever went to that one.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Yeah, they're sure they did.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   But it's one...
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.840]   And they're just mean to you.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.160]   That is the whole shtick.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.160]   Is that they're mean to you?
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.640]   I think they probably sat in that diner and was like, "I think there's a business here."
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   The hot dog place in Chicago is like that.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.200]   I can't remember the name of it.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.360]   Oh, I think every town.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.080]   San Francisco was very famous for Edsel Fong Ford.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080]   In Chinatown.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.640]   I was like all of Chinatown.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.040]   Yeah, but Edsel Fong Ford particularly was very rude.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.640]   And it was good food.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.240]   The second day I was in San Francisco ever, I was in Chinatown and I...
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.800]   There was like five of us that came in that were not Chinese.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   Everyone else is Chinese.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.320]   We all got put on the same table.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.800]   We all ordered different things and we all got some weird chicken soup thing.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800]   Like it was like...
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.520]   No, you want this!
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.960]   What are you talking about?
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   This is what you want?
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   They didn't say that.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   They didn't argue with us.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   They just all gave us the same thing.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.000]   And I was like, "That is the most subtle, like you're not welcome here that I've ever
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   said."
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Exactly.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.600]   Like, you know, we don't care what you said.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.480]   Um, cross-platform note takers, somebody is asking, "I use obsidian," which I'm really
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.680]   a fond of obsidian.md.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   I've never tried that.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680]   No, yeah.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.680]   That's...
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   Thank you.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   You're enabling my decision.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   Sorry.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680]   Sorry.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.680]   This was...
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.840]   Because the community is so rich, it's Mac, PC, Linux, so it's cross-platform.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.680]   You keep the files in Markdown on your own drive.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   So it's...
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.600]   You're never going to ever have to worry about it going out of business because your stuff
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.320]   will, you know, is yours.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   They do have a...
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.000]   It's free, but you could pay for a sync plan, which I do.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   It's worth it.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.680]   And it's just very, very good.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.360]   And the community around it is so good that there's a lot of extensions, which means there's
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.280]   very little you can't do because people scratch their itch and boom, there it is.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.280]   So let's see.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.280]   Are we done here?
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280]   Do we get everything?
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.280]   The...
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.280]   No, but wait.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.280]   There's more.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.400]   There's the game of the year.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.920]   So I thought Toko might be a game, but no.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.360]   League of Legends Wild Rift, little nod to the probably the most popular online game
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   of all, certainly up there.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   It's a...
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.360]   And all without advertising.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.360]   I'm being sarcastic.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360]   Big and...
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360]   Non-stop advertising.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.360]   Yes.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.000]   Marvel Future Revolution from Net Marvel is the iPad game of the year.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.320]   I have not played this, but I'm not a big fighting game fan.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.440]   I don't know what it looks like this is a fight.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.480]   By the way, with the League of Legends, have you guys seen Arkane?
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   No.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   But yeah.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   No, what's that?
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.480]   Wow.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   Is it a TV show?
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.880]   Yeah, Arkane is on, I think, Netflix.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:50.320]   And it is some of the best rendering in that style that I have ever seen.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.520]   My kids just watched the whole thing.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.360]   And my kids are like...
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.080]   My kids and my wife are really into watching...
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.160]   So it's like a League of Legends fan-fick kind of.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   You're in the League of Legends world.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160]   But yeah, look at the rendering.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.160]   Look at the trailer.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.920]   It's like they turn that thing all the way to 11.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.960]   If you look at the...
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.400]   I mean, it is just really, really well done.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.360]   So anyway, my kids really enjoyed it.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.360]   How about the story?
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.840]   The story is really good.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.240]   I said my kids really liked it.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.000]   They watched it all the way to the end and they watched them in large months.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   It's a really...
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   That is pretty.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   Yeah, and it's just gorgeous.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.160]   It's like the next... taking it to the next level and the story is really good.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.000]   I mean, according to my kids, it's not really my...
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.360]   It's not my cup of tea either.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360]   But it's the rendering, though.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.400]   But as the rendering, though, I looked at it and I looked at the trailer and I watched
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.440]   my kids watch it on a big screen.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.440]   John loves it.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.240]   He says, "It's not his cup of tea."
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   I wonder...
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.440]   I've been watching The Wheel of Time on Amazon Prime and a number of people said, "You
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.840]   know, they really should just have done this in this style as an animated because animation
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.920]   has gotten so good."
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.000]   And especially with fantasy, you can do so much.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.400]   I mean, they're spending $10 million in episode for Wheel of Time to build towns and burn them
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.400]   down.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.560]   And I think maybe animation...
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:23.280]   You know, the Marvel Cinematic movies, the action sequences would not look halfway as
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.160]   weird if the entire movie were animated.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.880]   It's these marginal disconnects between, "Oh, suddenly something turned off gravity
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.560]   in the entire world to make things more exciting."
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.120]   It also tricks the brain into thinking that, "Oh, I'm willing to accept a whole lot more
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:43.080]   because I'm seeing something that I know isn't real, so I'm willing to accept more fantasy."
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   But this conversation is making me suddenly wish that...
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.600]   A lot of reasons why I wish that Roger Ebert were still around, but man, he would have
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.680]   been so into games.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.800]   Not playing them, but enjoying the cinematic qualities, the storytelling qualities, the
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.720]   emotive qualities that were only just starting to wink through when he passed away.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.880]   He did write a piece about how games can't be art.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   Yeah, he wrote...
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.040]   Oh, the video games are art, dear, but I know that's a famous mistake.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.560]   Well, we'll go into it.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.240]   Basically, he was making a very, very thorough academic argument that unfortunately could
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   be easily summed up as, "Oh, he's saying video games aren't."
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.480]   No, no, I'm saying, "Here's how I choose to define cinematic art."
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.760]   The technology right now is not capable of delivering that component of it, therefore,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.280]   because of my academic...
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.720]   He might have changed his tune.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720]   He absolutely would have...
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.800]   Do you look at something like Last of Us?
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.720]   That is cinematic, absolutely cinematic.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720]   I can...
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.760]   So much of my YouTube watching is just watching people play through the stories of these
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   games.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   I'm watching NBA 2021.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   I don't know if that's cinematic.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   I don't know if that's cinematic.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   No, but I'm saying...
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   I'm more interested in the storyline.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   I'm more interested in the storyline of this player that they're being moved through.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   Oh my God.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.560]   But what happens if he doesn't make it through G-League?
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   Is it going to have to go to...
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.640]   Is it going to have to play record ball for the rest of his career?
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.960]   Hey, credit to Georgia Dow.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.360]   She's got a series called Therapist React.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:16.920]   You might remember she was doing Therapist React to the Marvel movies.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.120]   Now she's doing it to Arcane.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.280]   So here she is explaining what's going on with these characters emotionally.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.160]   And that shows you the depths you've got here.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.000]   He is so good at this too.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.480]   And just for a moment, she went from 10,000 subscribers to 25,000 in a week with this.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.600]   And these videos have 700,000 and 300,000 views now.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   This just came out.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.920]   It's 313,000 views already.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920]   She's obviously...
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   This is...
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920]   So...
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.480]   Lowing up as a kid's say.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.000]   I want to temper what I said about YouTube journalism with the fact that YouTube is
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.520]   given people a new way to do things that no one's ever done before.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:58.760]   You could never do a Therapist React to Arcane on National Network Television.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.520]   But thanks to YouTube, we are seeing an amazing amount of creativity and new ways.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.360]   Maybe the WB, but nowhere else.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   But not...
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:13.160]   Can I say that not only that, but the fact that there was so many barriers to entry
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.120]   when I started out that...
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.120]   Yes.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.120]   Me too.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.120]   You have to...
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   Fight your way to get on.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   We're asked...
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.300]   Sometimes the most valuable video you'll find on a subject is one with a channel with
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.000]   like 400 subscribers.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.920]   This thing has had 1400 views.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.680]   But this is someone who comes into the point of view of, "I am not the world expert on
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.880]   this technology.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.840]   However, I am a normal person who bought this one thing and here is my experience with
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   this one thing."
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.520]   And also, I care enough about this 10 minute video to be very, very expressive and clinical
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.880]   about the way I do it.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   That's what I love.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.680]   And the fact that sometimes these individuals who just made a couple of videos because if
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.480]   they interest them and they had an opinion to share can make a living sharing that stuff,
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.040]   that's the sort of thing that just makes me really happy about life in the 21st century.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.640]   And this is the point and Jeff Jarvis always makes this.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.880]   We always talk about the negatives and the downsides of social media and the internet.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.840]   But there's so many positive sizes.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:19.040]   We should really remember that this is a much better world on balance than it would have
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040]   been without.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.520]   It came with a price but also comes with benefits.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   Just to wrap this up.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   Of course, it's quite ranging too because...
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   Okay, sorry.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.800]   No, I was just going to say, you're also going to see Craig Mason doing the Last of Us for
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800]   HBO.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.520]   So it goes like full circle holding around and back again.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.920]   Mac Game of the Year missed.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.960]   Who would have thought that?
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.000]   Who would have thought that?
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.040]   It's a remastered version of missed from the same company from Cyan.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.880]   Wait, missed while we're playing Halo and waiting for the Matrix to come out.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   What year is this?
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   I know.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   I haven't played it.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.680]   Is it different at all from the original missed?
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:59.320]   I mean, the original missed was a hypercard stack and it moved very slowly from image to
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   image.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.120]   Oh my God, I totally got to buy a CD-ROM.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   This is awesome.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.920]   I haven't played it, so I guess I'll have to check it out.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.960]   That's why these awards are kind of important for the companies.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.120]   Full TV Game of the Year's Space, Marshall's 3 from PixelBite.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.640]   Looks like a top down RPG.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.360]   And the Apple Arcade Game of the Year, Fantasian from Mistwalker.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.840]   Again, I haven't checked these out.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.840]   I guess I will.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:33.520]   But for a deep dive in all of them, you must watch Ipad or iOS today from this week.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.760]   They just talked about all of these and I think really, really good stuff.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.120]   Can I raise a final question before we leave this topic?
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:47.000]   Does Apple ever put out a little document or a little bit of expunishing?
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.360]   Here's how we select these winners every year.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.640]   It'd be nice to know for the processes.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.160]   We have people inside of Apple that are part of an award committee that they promote
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.680]   and we have a wide pool that nominates them.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.720]   We then have a pool with an Apple that discusses them and then the final decision is at least
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.560]   signed off by three or four specific people.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.960]   Because it would break our hearts if we found out that, well, first of all, we have a sponsorship
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.280]   deal that includes high profile like, no.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.320]   Or we only consider apps that have above a certain threshold of whatever.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.640]   I'm not accusing Apple of anything, but these are the sort of things that make it more interesting.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.320]   It's more interesting when it turns out that the reason why the Game of the Year is the
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.680]   Game of the Year is because this one kind of freak inside Apple who had access to the
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:41.040]   right ear loved this game so much and was concerned about why aren't more people playing
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.440]   this game and suddenly made the 100 people who are in on the committee all rabid fans
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.280]   of this game and they decided, okay, our job is done.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.600]   We can move on to every other category with three months left to go because we are not
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.720]   allowing any other game other than this one.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.520]   We now all love to become the app of the year because we want this game to be known by
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   everybody.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.160]   I think it's pretty clear Apple is not doing something like it's a sponsorship deal, but
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.160]   I agree.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.160]   You're right.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.000]   They're all well known.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.080]   There's no major discovery.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.840]   So I would be very curious.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.240]   I don't know of Apple.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.000]   I'm not feeling it's best at all.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.040]   It's always, no, no, no, but they should.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   I agree.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   They totally should.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040]   It's all of these.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   It's usually the editorial team.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.680]   So it's the people who are responsible.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680]   Let's ask Serena.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680]   She would know.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   She can't tell.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   She's evangelism now.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   She can't tell.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   Oh, she's an evangelist.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.200]   anel Cuti used to work in editorial, they don't anymore. But
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.280]   the process was generally that they would get together and sort
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.880]   of figure out what to them was emblematic of the biggest trends
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.280]   and the biggest movements in the App Store for any given year. The
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.620]   80s are more like what service to Apple's framework agendas. Like
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.860]   if you took the latest and greatest and made something really good
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.360]   out of it. The 80s would recognize you but this was more
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.720]   like trends. And I think that's why they have this whole section
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.460]   of other additional apps that they thought were great just
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:58.440]   based on the whole last two years of COVID that we lived
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.640]   through. Yeah, I actually didn't mention that. But the top
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.240]   trend of 2021 was connection. Join us to celebrate the apps that
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.640]   worked to restore our sense of togetherness by helping us find
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.000]   friendship romance community even some lighthearted competition
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.600]   among us is in their Canva is in their peanut that sounds so
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.080]   familiar. What is peanut? I'm trying to remember. Bumble
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:23.760]   peanut at all. Yeah. Find friends and support. Oh, it's for
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.000]   women. That's why fertility motherhood menopause. None of us
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.760]   here need that. I don't think Bumble was another winner
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.600]   dating and meet people. This is a lot of people like Bumble
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:42.040]   because it's also about making friends not specifically about
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.000]   well, you know, and Edo Kra which I do use. Edo Kra
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.440]   highlights black owned restaurants in your area. And it's a
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.360]   great app. I really like Edo Kra. So this might be a really good
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.840]   example. I think these awards actually are kind of except with
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.440]   the exception of Canva among us, lesser known apps that have
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.240]   made a difference. And I think this is a good these are good
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.360]   five very good choices. Yeah. So this is why these these are
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.120]   why these sort of things should never be like popularity votes
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.840]   because well, great. The one thing that everybody's playing is
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.520]   now becoming more famous. But it's always there's a danger of
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.440]   making this insight baseball. But sometimes it's interesting
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.120]   to find out that oh, so none of these documentaries would have
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.880]   even be nominated except for the fact that people who actually
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.840]   work in documentaries did this. Oh, I'll get off the topic. But
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.120]   it's it reminds me of one of the most interesting
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.000]   controversial award wins, which is when
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.920]   suicides the first suicide squad, I think the cost of the
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.320]   makeup for Harley Quinn won best makeup in a year in which
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.320]   Oh my God. But this how about this other movie? These
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.840]   incredible alien effects. This other one which this guy was
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.920]   that no, these are being nominated and voted on by people
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.400]   who are actual makeup bars. They understand that they looked at
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.520]   this with their mouths of gape saying they had Harley Quinn's
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.920]   makeup perfect at the start of the movie and then gradually get
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.080]   worn down by the things that are happening in her experiences
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.760]   over the time goes forward. Do you have any idea how impossible
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.240]   that is to achieve on a three month long film shoot? That's
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.480]   sort of stuff that I love finding out how are they what are
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.560]   they seeing in these these nominees that really impress
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.160]   them and who are they impressing? Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.960]   someday we'll know how Apple determines these. Let's take a
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.400]   little break or an Apple TV plus and we'll have more coming up
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.680]   in just a bit. Andy and not co Renee Richie Alex Lindsey
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.360]   here. Our show today brought to you by Udacity. Love

[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.120]   they're exclusive to Udacity and they are great. Listen to some
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:15.360]   of the top nanodegree programs in the cutting edge area like AI
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.600]   or when you love to get a nanodegree in the flying car and
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.880]   autonomous flight engineer. Intro to self driving cars, machine
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.520]   learning engineer, robotics, software engineer, and a lot more.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.720]   And Udacity is not just here to give you the classes. They're
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.320]   here to encourage your career growth. They want to provide you

[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.360]   Just look at some of the success stories on the Udacity site
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.640]   like Aaron. He said Udacity's nanodegree programs and career
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.080]   resource center played an integral part in helping me land a job
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.600]   offer from Google. Yeah, Google. Udacity's courses are created
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.800]   with companies like Google partners and industry leaders
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.000]   like Microsoft Google, IBM, Amazon Web Services and more. And
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.440]   your teachers, your instructors are from the team leads at these
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.440]   top companies. So they really look at that blockchain developer.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.680]   Wouldn't that be cool? You're going to get the right knowledge
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.800]   from the experts who are working in the field every day. I love
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.920]   it because Udacity is project based. You got it. That's active
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.000]   learning. You got to get your hands dirty. You got to actually
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.600]   you can learn the stuff. But until you've really sat down and
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.920]   done it. You can't say you know it. And that's the whole point
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.560]   of Udacity's nanodegree programs. Project based active learning
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.040]   that lets you test your knowledge. All homework and projects
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.680]   are reviewed by qualified professionals. People were working
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.640]   in the field. You'll get real human feedback code reviews like
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.880]   you would get in business with access to mentors 24/7 so you're
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.560]   never on your own. You can always ask for help and flexible
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.680]   schedules. You choose what works for you. They know a lot of
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.480]   people who are Udacity learners are you know have day jobs so you
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.520]   can put in as little as five to 10 hours a week and still
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.440]   graduate in three months. Great scholarships available to

[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.600]   thank you for supporting Mac Break Weekly dear listener or
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.720]   viewer by using that address only because that way we get
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.240]   credit for Udacity, Udacity, UDA CITY.com/twit. I mentioned
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:21.480]   this, but that's really how it works. There's no other way of
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.400]   them monitoring how well their advertising works. So please
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.640]   use those addresses. The problem is we have a smart audience
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.800]   and they know, Udacity, I remember that and they type in
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.960]   Udacity, which is fine. Okay, if you're going to do that,
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:40.760]   that's fine. But if you remember, Udacity.com/twit.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:48.960]   US State Department says, or maybe it's Apple is saying this,
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:54.880]   that the NSO group has provided Pegasus software to hack at
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:01.560]   least nine State Department employees operating out of Uganda.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.880]   The hacks took place in the last several months, officials
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.520]   either based in Uganda or focused on matters concerning the
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.720]   country, according to sources. Gee, I wonder who might have
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.240]   bought the the exploit from the NSO group to go after these
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:17.600]   guys.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.120]   They don't target American phones, but they differentiate based
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   on phone numbers and these state officials had phone. Oh, yeah,
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.760]   well, we couldn't possibly we could possibly have known they
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.280]   had phone. We do we had no idea.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.600]   Oh, yeah, yeah, gambling and the establishment.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.040]   We didn't have any indications as the NSO group that there are
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.320]   tools were used, but we have canceled access for the relevant
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.080]   customers and we're going to investigate.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:48.040]   Meanwhile, Apple is suing them. Facebook is suing them. The US
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.680]   government's sanctioning them. I might have ordered your out of
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.080]   order. The whole corner. No comment from the Ugandan embassy in
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.880]   Washington. No comment from Apple.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.440]   Yeah, we're going to see a lot of LinkedIn updates things. So
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.720]   and so has no longer working for NSO. The next message
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.480]   congratulates them for the new job at SNO. Yeah, they've done
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.400]   that. They've done that people. Yeah, this is the way of the
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.520]   world to just change the name. Maybe I'm not really a software
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.360]   group. How about that?
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   Apple sends an alert to affected users.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.640]   And then in this case, they were notified by Apple, including
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.680]   American citizens identifiable as US government employees, because
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.520]   their email address is ended in state.gov. How could we have
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:45.080]   known? There you go. How could we have known? Do you know how
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.720]   impossible it is to understand how well cards work in search
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:51.280]   terms? It's like it's like a man. It's like moon man stuff. God.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.920]   This was a day and other targets notified by Apple and
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.560]   multiple countries were infected through the same graphics
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:02.200]   process processing of vulnerability. Apple fixed in
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.520]   September. But you know, that's that means they were hacked
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.080]   before then, right? Yeah.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:15.040]   Basically the way it works, NSO group sends an iMessage that
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.640]   opens up the door and then says to whoever bought this exploit.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.800]   Go ahead, have, have at it, have some fun.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.560]   Victims would not see or need to interact with a prompt for the
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.560]   hack to be successful. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.040]   It was just that Apple, Apple shut, you know, Apple shut down
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.560]   all these exploits shortly thereafter. But it just goes to
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.080]   show that there are always more exploits out there and a well
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.680]   funded company like this with such well, deep pocketed people
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.160]   behind the people who buy those services will always find the
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.920]   next one. It's it's it's a blight.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.400]   Yeah. You remember last week, we mentioned that tile had been
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.200]   picked up by a family safety app life 360. Well, here's the
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.920]   other shoe dropping. Yeah. Life 360 is happy. Happy, I tell you
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.680]   to sell your precise location data to whoever wants to buy it.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.920]   Yep. Do you like the worst part of this is that there were all
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.920]   these articles saying how Apple was cracking down on companies
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.760]   like Life 360, just because they were using MDM software to try
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.000]   to protect your kids and Apple was being anti competitive.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   Damn them. Yeah. Lock down the parental control. And they were
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.800]   so angry. Those articles were so snarky and so angry. They never
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.760]   stopped for a second to just ask why like what is the other
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.560]   discussion? What is the other point here? And also like Apple
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.000]   is encroaching on tile. This is like I'm not saying like be
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.240]   hard on Apple be be severe on Apple. Never get the benefit of
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.560]   the doubt. But ask the other question. Well, that's why I'm
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.760]   glad this is getting reported. The markups reporting that Life
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.680]   360 is used by 33 million people worldwide. The app is selling
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.880]   data on kids and families whereabouts to approximately a
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.600]   dozen data brokers who have sold data virtually anyone who
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.240]   wants to buy it. Yeah. And everybody should keep in mind
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.800]   that it doesn't mean well, what does that matter? Only I only
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.520]   use my tile tracker for this one thing. No, it's the app on your
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.920]   phone. They've got it. They've got everything. Yeah. And I'm not
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.240]   saying by the way, this is not asserting that tiles doing this.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.320]   This is Life 360, the new owner of tile. And right. And the
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.760]   other thing to underline what Andy's talking about, it's not
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.960]   just that it what happens is the data brokers are taking the
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.880]   data from everyone. So they're they're connecting where you were
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.360]   and what you bought and then what you're doing here and what
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.320]   you know, and when you when you go to a page that has a Facebook
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.840]   you know, tracker on it, they're tying that all back in. And so
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.080]   so all of this stuff, it's this huge web that you're now part of.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.600]   And I think that this is going to probably be, you know, I
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.440]   probably won't be the end of tile, but tile, you know, with
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.720]   without Apple there, it might last for a little longer with Apple
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.080]   already having an air tag there. I think anybody would be nuts to
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.880]   buy a tile at this point. The market spoke to two former
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.920]   employees, both still employed in the data industry. They formerly
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:05.280]   worked at location data brokers, cubic and X mode. They they said
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.360]   that life 360 is one of the largest sources of data for the
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:16.440]   data broker industry. CEO and founder of life 360 says, well,
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.680]   we have no means to confirm or deny the accuracy. We see data
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.800]   caught doing this. They did say by the way, and this is a direct
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.960]   quote from the markup. Thank you the markup.org. We see data as
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.880]   an important part of our business model that allows us to
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.160]   keep the core life 360 services free for the majority of our
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.520]   users, including features that have improved driver safety and
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.120]   saved numerous lives.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   Yeah, see, Google can get away with that when they're saying
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.720]   that we provide infrastructure for tiniest institutions to the
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.960]   largest institutions that cost nothing. We give you a mapping
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.440]   system that is the best in the world and costs you nothing
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.680]   on and on and on. But yes, we do run a network that use
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.600]   exploits us stuff. That seems like a fair deal. When a company
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.320]   like when coming like this says, no, no, we're using it to
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.680]   make no, no, no, don't tell don't even pretend that's in any
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.560]   way a fair proposition. It's like we're here. We're going to hit
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:14.080]   you in the head eight times with this paper towel roll. But
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.440]   we're also going to give you one piece of free candy. It's
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.080]   like hard candy. It's like, no, you're being jerks,
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.480]   proper tini that we should be grateful to you are you doing
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.920]   anything innovative. We should mention that if you read the
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.040]   live 360 privacy policy does mention cubic and all states
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.560]   arity. They say those are among the companies that we sell
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:37.240]   data to the the leaker and X former x mode engineer said the
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.440]   raw data that the company received from life 360 was among
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.440]   the most valuable offerings due to the sheer volume and
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.000]   precision of the data. A former cubic employee joke, the
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.240]   company wouldn't be able to run its marketing campaigns without
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.200]   life 360s constant flow of location information. And again,
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.240]   for for advertisers and for people who are talking, you know,
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.960]   who are trying to figure out all of this stuff to make it
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.200]   work, this is this is just another brick in the wall. Like,
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.880]   this is why people say when they get the option on an
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.520]   on an Apple phone, it's why 85% say, Nope, I don't I'm not
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.600]   interested because it's gross, you know, and it just keeps on
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.560]   showing up as more and more gross, you know, and I think
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.560]   that that's going to be it's going to keep on making it
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.880]   harder and harder. People are going to be more and more open to
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.320]   further regulation and mostly just them just checking out.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.480]   Well, it's the apps you don't expect that are doing it to
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.640]   like in some ways you expect certain apps will do it. And
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.160]   like like Andy said, with Google, we have a fair exchange for
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.640]   those things. But when you turn on like the Bluetooth monitoring
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.200]   thing or you turn on the tracking thing, and suddenly like
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.120]   your local TV network is taking all this information, the store
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.800]   at the shopping mall is following you through the thing,
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.840]   you're like that, you have no need for that. You're just
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.440]   stealing that information at that point.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.280]   For me, the turning point was when I got the GDPR notice from PG&E,
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.280]   that's our that's they provide power in California. And I was
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.920]   like, you guys, you can't even keep my power on and you're like
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.880]   stealing my data. You know, like you, you know, like, I was
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.600]   insulted, you know, like, the reason I went to the page was
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.480]   because I didn't have power, you know, like, you know, and
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.040]   there was another little fun tidbit. The CEO and founder of
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.560]   Life360 Chris Hall's said, well, I can't reveal who our
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.600]   customers were. They're about a dozen partners, but I would be
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.200]   supportive of legislation that would require me to reveal
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.720]   that. Yeah, yes. So they're concerned with privacy, but not
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.640]   for a lot of people.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.600]   That's contractual.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.920]   Their clients get privacy.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.920]   Just to be clear, it is not their product. Whether this data
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.400]   is sold, it aggregated, I think it probably is rather than
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.000]   where is Leo to, you know, last night, it's more like, but
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.960]   again, but again, that data, I wouldn't be surprised though, if
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.880]   that data is it when you say group people, though, it is
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.480]   tying you what they want in aggregate data. Yeah, no, it's
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:50.880]   not.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.360]   But you can fill it out person fairly well. You want to tie
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.000]   your position.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.640]   You've been spoke person said the company doesn't sell raw
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.120]   location data, but provides access to an aggregated set of
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.960]   data through its workbench tool. And by the way, customers
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.760]   include the CDC to track mobility transiting to COVID-19. The
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.400]   CDC only exports aggregate privacy safe analytics for
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.280]   research purposes, which completely anonymizes any
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.160]   individual user data. cubic does not sell data to law
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.240]   enforcement agencies or provide raw data feeds to
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.120]   government partners, unlike others, such as
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.160]   our collector and safe graph. So cubic's one, they don't, but
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:33.360]   others do. So okay, that's the point taken. All that data is
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.960]   being tied in. And again, what they want to do is they want to
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.280]   tie it to your Facebook tracking bit, your purchases it
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.800]   Safeway, your, you know, they're building this, they're
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.040]   building a picture of you that they can then manipulate and
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:46.520]   pull that.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:52.360]   Yep, I shopped in an Amazon go store for the first time. So I
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.240]   could like document it and write about it later on this
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.840]   weekend. And it's like, just every, every moment you're in
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:01.440]   there, you realize that I am doing nothing. I'm not tapping
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:05.760]   into like after you tap in at the entrance, it's like, I am not
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.160]   like, make sure you make sure your phone is turned on and
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.920]   switched to this or now scan this every time you take this
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.080]   when you took this sandwich, make sure that you put this
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.240]   you you you scan this thing or whatever, or make sure that
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.080]   there's a sensor that you can see an optical sensor to see
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.160]   that like that the sensor has been taken. All I did was
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.480]   shoplift when I was going to eat on the Amtrak train on the
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.320]   way home. And that was able to have such granularity of being
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.320]   able to track what I'm doing and where I am inside that space,
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:37.080]   that it didn't it just I got a ping as soon as I was on the
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.520]   sidewalks. And here's exactly what you bought. Here's exactly
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.360]   what we what we charged you for. Thank you come again. Well,
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:45.440]   let me ask this. It's not clear that it is individual data.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.400]   It's a that maybe doesn't surprise me. But let me ask
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:54.800]   this. Would it be okay? If the usage were and this is I think
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.360]   most of the companies are attempting to at least give the
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:00.320]   impression of if not explicitly saying if the usage were
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:06.280]   aggregate data like we know males 25 to 54 traveled to the
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.040]   Amtrak train between this hour and this hour and great numbers,
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.480]   we're sold to advertisers. That kind of information would
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:17.160]   would you all be okay with that? Yes, so long as there's
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.920]   something in the user group and saying that acknowledging that
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.400]   hey, we will we will or and we can sell aggregate data. So
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.760]   long as there's something in the user agreement saying we are
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.600]   expressively forbidden in this agreement from selling
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.040]   personally, identifyable information in terms of what we
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.840]   collect, we will never we will never tell anybody. Andy and
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.640]   Akka was here at this store. Here is what he did. Here's what
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.320]   he bought. I think that's I think that's fair place as long as
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.960]   it's there for people to read. I think what we really need
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.160]   however, is federal legislation saying that your personal
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.040]   data belongs to you. It is your property. Just like just like
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.240]   soon as I publish something, the copyright belongs to me.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.600]   That's what the law says. I don't have to file anything. I
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.600]   don't have to declare an intent. It belongs to me. So if you
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.400]   take it from me without telling me, I can legally do
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.000]   something to make your day very, very hard. We need something
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.560]   like that about personal information saying that we I
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.000]   have to specifically agree to sell this or lease this to you.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.320]   You can't just simply have an agreement saying, Oh, by the
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.960]   way, it's kind of okay. It has to be something more than that.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.120]   And we have to be clear that with all the apps that are on our
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.840]   phone doing all the different tracking, people can take
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:26.440]   anonymized data and make it run anonymized. So they can
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.840]   they can tease all this information out and start tying
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.520]   you directly to it. And that's the real danger. And that's why
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.360]   Apple's giving us the option to turn it off. Here's what the
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.320]   article goes on to say to former life 360 employees also told
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.880]   the markup, the company, while it states it anonymizes the data
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.400]   it sells fails to take necessary precautions to ensure that
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.640]   location histories cannot be tracked back to individuals. They
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.120]   said that while the company removed the most obvious
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.840]   identifying user information, it did not make efforts to fuzz,
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:00.960]   hash, aggregate or reduce the precision of the location to
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:05.560]   preserve privacy. Halls, the CEO said that all of life 360s
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.160]   contracts prohibit its customers from reidentifying
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.720]   individual users along with other privacy and safety protective
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.560]   practices. He says they follow industry best practices for
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:22.080]   privacy. And only certain customers. Okay, wow, only
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.400]   certain customers like cubic receive raw location data. The
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.480]   former X mode engineer said the company X mode also received
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:35.640]   raw data from life 360. The company relies on its customers
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.200]   to obfuscate that data based on their specific applications
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:43.000]   says all's. Some of our data partners, it's up to you.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.760]   We're going to give you the information, but you've got to
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.720]   have a you've got to keep your phone 300 miles away from you
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.360]   every time.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.760]   Yeah. So let me tell you how profitable this is in 2016, the
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.440]   company made $693,000 from selling data. Four years later,
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:05.360]   $16 million from selling location data. They did have a loss of
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.920]   16.3 million last year. But I suspect that's partly because
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.160]   they're buying on is going anywhere. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.000]   anywhere that we could try. Yeah, that's right. They're like,
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.080]   but they're also buying living room in the kitchen and the, you
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.640]   know, the company's expanding its business to include other
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.800]   quote digital safety products, data breach alerts, credit
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.680]   monitoring and identity theft protection features. They're
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.360]   Australian. They're Australian. I didn't know they were an
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.680]   Australian company. They've also acquired companies that
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:35.080]   expand its tracking. In 2019, they purchased zen screen, a
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.760]   family screen time monitoring app in April, it purchased a
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.240]   wearable location device company, Geo bit aimed at tracking
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.600]   young children, pets and seniors.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.720]   Hals said they have no plans to sell data from Geo bit devices
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:54.120]   or its digital safety services. And then of course, they
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.840]   announced the plans to buy a tile. It's just too sticky. Like
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.520]   once you're in there, you can't, you know, and the other thing
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.440]   is the regulations will be light and slow because a lot of the
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.840]   intelligence agencies don't really want you to do this. You
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.960]   know, yeah, so they're kind of like they're talking to the
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.000]   legislators going, you know, like, like, let's not let's not get
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.160]   too heavy handed here. You know, it's it's pretty useful.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.840]   It's also it's also all this this timeline really explains why
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.360]   it's important to note the difference, particularly at
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.680]   Apple. This is what Apple strengths between we collect
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.760]   information from you, but we're very, very trustworthy. I
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.520]   believe the Google collects information from me, but it's
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.240]   very, very trustworthy. They treat it very, very securely.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.480]   Apple can say that we collect as we don't collect any
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:37.200]   information from you that we don't absolutely need because we
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.080]   do trust app. I absolutely trust Apple with this stuff more than
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.520]   any other tech company of its size or under its size. However,
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.160]   just think about imagine 30 years ago saying, well, Sears will
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.560]   never go out of business. Polaroid. Oh my God, it will never
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.760]   just be like a logo that people can stick that a company can
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.440]   stick on any piece of crappy electronics to make it think
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.760]   it's sophisticated. Apple could be that company. It all needs
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.960]   is a couple of is a couple of bad generations in which suddenly
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:06.480]   there is this immense, the most trustworthy company in the
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.120]   world with the most valuable treasure trove of previously
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.040]   unknown, unreleased, unevaluated, unmonetized personal
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.200]   consumer data is now up for grabs by a bankruptcy court. It's
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.520]   like, it's not impossible. So this is why these things matter.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.960]   It matters when Apple says we are not just good with your data.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.440]   We're actually not collecting it in the first room. Remember,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.960]   again, that even if you get that pop up saying you want to let
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.880]   this guy track you if you're buying an app specifically for
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.880]   tracking, you're going to say, Oh, yeah, I guess I do want to
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.560]   allow that. There is, I should tell you, if you want to use
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.440]   life 360, a setting that can disable the sale of location data
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.200]   in the privacy settings. So there is a checkbox. Yeah, it's
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:51.400]   nobody tells you about it. But you can find it. This is and
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.800]   this this on wrapping like as this is a this is a system that
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.640]   Apple is like slowly adding, you know, to the knowledge to
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.240]   knowledge. This came out in the press. But if you look at the
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.480]   new updates that Apple's working on where they are going to
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.840]   start telling you everything your app is doing, like every website,
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:10.120]   everything that it's talking about, all those things. If people
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:13.600]   thought that people that it felt gooey before, it's not
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.000]   going to be a lot more saying when about this, if Apple didn't
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.560]   collect this information, this is the problem with both Apple,
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.760]   Google, Facebook, their first party. So all of these warnings
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.920]   are about third party data collection, but all the first
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.160]   party data collection continues. Yeah, but I but I but I still
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.720]   think what the effect that it's going to have on people is when
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.080]   you open it up and you get these reports of 30. You'll suddenly
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.320]   be aware of this. You're going to be like, wow, I do not want
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.240]   that. But again, it's a little it's Apple's hand way
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.080]   different like because it's saying, yeah, all these people,
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.040]   these bad people are collecting data. Don't don't but they
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.000]   don't mention the first and it's not just Apple's Google,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.800]   Facebook, Microsoft, everybody else. There is first party
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   collection and that's a big problem, I think. But but what
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.160]   that but what Apple's not doing is interconnecting it with all
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.200]   the other all the other like, you know, face, we don't know
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.080]   exactly what Apple's doing. I mean, I think they
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.360]   apply that they're taking good care of your data. It's not
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.800]   there selling ads against it. So against the first party
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.880]   information that they have, but they're not cross checking it
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.120]   with Safeway purchases. That's the I mean, well, little that's
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.840]   where it's dangerous. Like this when you when you get out into
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.560]   that web is where things get super weird and people are able
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.480]   to build the stuff when you're talking about how people
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.240]   interact with your own app. I think that that's very different
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.480]   than as you start to cross, you know, when you start to cross
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.520]   it, you can get into a whole different world of knowing
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.120]   about someone. That's why third party that's the real
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.160]   very different than the real value is you stick that out.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.080]   First party date is how they interact with with us in the app.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.240]   And I want to create a better service and I want to give them
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.800]   those things. Third party app is I'm going to connect you with
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.360]   a thousand other all this information information tracking
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.280]   that you're talking about here. Plus, again, what you're what
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.320]   you're buying with your credit card, where you're driving,
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.440]   how you're what you're, you know, where you're going, who
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.000]   you're standing next to with two iPhones, you know, like, like
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.400]   those are the kind of things that, you know, that that's why
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.360]   you know, you say, Oh, I was just talking to this person about
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.440]   this. Well, that person's probably searching something there
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.200]   and that it knows they search this. Now you're standing next
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.560]   to them. I'm going to send you an ad about that. That's what's
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.040]   happening. Like that is like that's the part that is super
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:15.480]   gooey. And and so I think that I think I don't I think it's
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.480]   very important that we don't equate first party and third
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.080]   party as the same thing because it is not it is the first party
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.880]   is how to make the app work better. Third party is
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.960]   everything's out there like and it's all being interconnected
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.960]   and you're being used, you know, like, like I would say
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:34.040]   something very rough, used like, but but you're being used, you
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.880]   know, like, you know, and so so you just need to, you know,
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.240]   third party app is the devil, like third party sharing is you
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.200]   should never that should not be okay. It's not okay. I think
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.200]   there is a risk though. Well, I won't use Apple because I don't
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.800]   want to offend you, Alex, but let's say Facebook or or Google
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.920]   there. They have an advantage if they can get the third party
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:02.560]   data shut down their first party data is so good that they have
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.200]   a massive advantage. It's something called regulatory capture
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:09.480]   where they basically can can say, you know, pull up. It's why
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.960]   you're seeing all these ads on TV from Facebook lately saying,
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.160]   Oh, yeah, they really should government should really regulate
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.880]   230 because they can handle it. But any upstart any competition
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.640]   can't. And I think that this is the risk of people thinking that
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.120]   they're protected by by stopping third party data. Apple knows
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.680]   what credit cards you use. They know when you're next to an iPhone
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.160]   user because of airdrop. They know a lot of this stuff. They
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:38.080]   have this data. So the fact that they're not cross referencing
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.920]   it with data from Google is a small but you understand like
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.640]   reassurance. Google and Facebook's cross referencing is the secret
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:49.480]   to the operation. Like it is what they're doing. So you don't
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.480]   think what Apple knows is of value. I think that I don't think
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.880]   Apple keeps very much of it. Like Apple doesn't want that data.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.160]   They don't need it. They don't. We don't know that data. We
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.040]   don't know. Do you know? Do you have a according to the language
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.600]   they don't actually trade. There's a vast loss information. They
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.640]   don't exfiltrate and vast loss of space. They don't keep. They
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.800]   don't need it. They're not good at this. If you look at their
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.320]   advertising efforts, they're so come out good at it. It doesn't
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.680]   necessarily mean that they're safe. So I just would say, look,
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.040]   in general, I'm going to feel better about Apple. We've been
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.560]   talking a lot about the privacy of Google, Google's Android
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.960]   Auto. And now they have an operating system, Android
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.120]   Automotive, which shares a huge amount of data back to Google
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.520]   compared to what Apple's CarPlay shares back to Apple. You
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.360]   know, in general, I feel like Apple's doing generally trying
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:43.280]   to do the right thing. But Apple is a for profit corporation. I
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.480]   would not assume that they are acting as you have any time.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.760]   I think they're acting on their own behalf, but their own
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.600]   behalf relates to privacy. And they don't need this to make
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.720]   money. Like that's the big thing. It's not it's not. Yeah,
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.600]   Microsoft doesn't newly edged to do by now pay later. But for
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.160]   some reason, they do. And so you can't diminish the desire of
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.960]   a company to make even more money. Well, also, the
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.360]   issue decides he wants to go big into this to be a concern
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.520]   because they have the apparatus to derive huge loss of
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.360]   information. But I think that the snapback that that Apple got
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:18.320]   with just the we're going to search your photos is the problem
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.120]   is is there would be it would be almost impossible for Apple to
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:25.160]   change a direction dramatically, because we expect something from
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.280]   them that is very different than what we expect from everyone
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.320]   else. Google said they were that that we're like, well, that's
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.960]   what Google does. It's true. But if if if you know, you buy
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:36.240]   into it when you do it one step into it, we've bought into, you
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:39.520]   know, as Apple users, we bought into something that we expect to
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.480]   get. And and their entire that's the that's the reason it's not
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:47.160]   that Apple is altruistic in this area or defending us. It's
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.640]   that their business model is based around it, you know, and so
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:52.560]   the thing is is that they that they and it would be very,
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:55.240]   very difficult at this point. They've created a contract, you
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.920]   know, with us in the way that they we bought it, which you saw
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.880]   as soon as people got upset, that we expect something as
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.960]   users and if they if they broke that, that unwritten
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.280]   contract with folks, they probably, you know, it would be a
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.560]   huge hit on their income, you know, because people would
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.320]   suddenly start thinking about should I be here or not. But as
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:14.520]   long as they hold that contract, I think that and I think
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.480]   that's why they can't really go down that path very far. I
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:20.160]   mean, you know, if it because if it if this article that we saw
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:23.760]   with life 3060 came out with Apple, their stock would fall by
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.520]   20%. Like it would, you know, because it would, it would, you
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.200]   know, and their revenue would definitely fall, you know,
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.120]   people would be like, because they can't afford that that
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.960]   kind of press. And so and in general, you can't do a lot of
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.080]   things that you can't afford the press for very long, because
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.360]   you'll get a snarky Washington Post articles, we call it by
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.280]   3%. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.400]   Okay, I'll just say that Apple sometimes brings this sort of
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:51.160]   risk on themselves by if they don't thump their Bible against
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.080]   the table over and over again about how they are the sole
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.960]   people, the whole corporation that understands and respects
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.160]   and adores privacy and security. This is when say, Oh, what
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.520]   else did you lie to us about Apple? Or what else did you hope
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:05.360]   that we wouldn't find that we wouldn't hear the full story
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.240]   about? Whereas it's kind of okay when a company says, I'm
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:11.040]   we're no, when a company is going to waffle a little bit on
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.200]   that point, at least you know that they understand that it
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.240]   would make us upset if we learned about this at minimum.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:24.080]   Be careful. Bad guys are putting air tags. According to the
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.920]   York regional police.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.960]   Those are abusing their air closures. They're putting air
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:33.880]   tags in your in your gas or your trailer.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.600]   All the maple syrup in Canada, like like, like I just didn't
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:43.880]   expect this from Canada. Officers, according to the York
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:47.960]   police, sorry, Canadians should not be doing this. Officers
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.640]   in New York, we hold Canadians at a higher. We bought
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:56.000]   Canadians at a higher standard. Like, I'm sorry, Alex, I just
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.360]   reminded me of like a parent who has like three children, like
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.120]   one of which gets all A's and volunteers for the community.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.840]   You're the one like smokes by the boys room and does all
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.440]   that. So you know, I expect Teddy to be a loser and a bear
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.800]   with a family. But John, it really hurts when you can't be
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.280]   tracking.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.560]   What are you talking about?
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.280]   The good kids who are the worst. I just want to say that. So
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.800]   the way this this is good. We're good at PR. Sorry. Good.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.240]   Yeah, exactly. That's all it means. You're good. You're good
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:28.760]   at marketing. That's all. In fact, that that's even more
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.120]   suspicious. I was the kid who was coughing, like, why no Mr.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.960]   Vice President, does that does that sound like something I
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:39.040]   would do? Who's worse? Eddie, I got a mousse or the beaver. Come
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.800]   on, who's worse? Since September 21 officers have identified
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.600]   five incidents where suspects have placed small tracking devices
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.360]   on high end vehicles. So you're at a mall, you're at a parking
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.320]   lot. They go, and that's a nice Hummer. They place four packs
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.360]   Leo. They come in four packs. They place the air tags in there
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:04.080]   and then they follow you home. I steal it from your driveway.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.320]   These typically use tools like screwdrivers to enter the
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.240]   vehicles. They through the driver or passenger door while
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.480]   ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside an electronic device
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.920]   typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting is
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.800]   connected to the onboard diagnostics port. Well, this
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:24.040]   sounds hard. So now these days, air tags makes it much, much
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.320]   easier. The key is that you have to put your air tag in as well.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.880]   So it's their air tag is they're tracking you that. But when
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.000]   they drive away, there could be an air tag anywhere. I think
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.880]   air tags are the worst possible choice for this because don't
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:38.000]   you get warned when a when an air tag is you do you do it.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.520]   There was an article today about it. There was an article
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.640]   today about a woman who was driving home, I think from school
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:46.720]   and a warning went off saying there is an unregistered air
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:49.280]   tag in his car or location device in this car. And she's
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.720]   like, do I stop? Do I go home? Do I drive to the police
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.240]   station? And she couldn't find it like they hadn't started
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.360]   beeping it. She just got the alert on her phone and she's like,
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.840]   I don't know what to do now. This is so creepy. So like the
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.640]   really hard to balance. They should have it set up where you
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.400]   could say there's one near you make it beep. I guess that
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:07.280]   would be other issues. But but if it saw that it was really
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.160]   only you and not near anybody else, it would be you know, like
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.920]   it that they couldn't be searched by anyone else. You're in a
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:17.440]   car driving. It feels like it's it's your identify. We're
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.320]   also this is such a complicated issue to solve because you are
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:22.800]   talking about just like a just like how you win the
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.840]   historical guide is the galaxy game by holding T and one hand
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.040]   and no T and the other. This is exactly the same thing where
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.400]   you have to have you have a device that has to be able to
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.480]   broadcast all the time its location. On the other hand, you
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:39.960]   have to make sure that no one can track its location by the
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.000]   virtue of the fact that it's broadcasting all the time. It is
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.480]   such a hard thing to solve. And I don't I don't fault Apple for
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.560]   not solving it. I think that Apple for me evaluating this as an
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:53.040]   Apple product. This sounds like the sort of thing that they
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.360]   would have looked at tile they would have investigated tile
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.960]   that would have done a million experiments on tile and decided
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.400]   that you know what we're going to need another couple of years
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.040]   to really figure this thing out. It's one I think that all I
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.720]   think also from a regulatory perspective or a criminal
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:09.520]   perspective, you know, what you have to do is start the
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.160]   government's have to start saying hey, you know what, using a
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.960]   tracker as a felony, you know, three to five years, you know,
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.120]   like, you know, if you if you put it on someone who doesn't know
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.920]   that it's coming, like if you, you know, a first degree, you
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.960]   know, tracking things should be real real real time. And that
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.160]   takes all the fun out of it real quick.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.960]   The cost of entry like previously, people would just get a
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.840]   cheap smartphone and throw it in the car. It's what in the
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:33.000]   gym bag. And they tracked me right that way. But that was
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.720]   like 300 bucks a pop. And now you're talking about 20 bucks
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.760]   a pop. Just a matter of I think we're gonna do this also
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:40.000]   stuff right. I think we're gonna have to adjust the criminal
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.520]   code for this one. Little Easter egg in your Apple store app on
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.920]   your phone. I've turned it on online and it's snowing. And if I
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.280]   shake it like a snow globe, the snow starts moving around.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.040]   When you started a shed of shake it, I guess, I guess some
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.160]   developers at the app store at a little time on their hands.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.240]   All you have to do is go into the app store and type let it
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.280]   snow. You don't even have to hit search. Just type let it
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.280]   snow and it starts snowing. I don't know how to turn it off
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.440]   though. So they did this a couple years. You've done this in
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.040]   the past. Yeah. Yeah. So I presume in January, it'll stop. I
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:18.480]   don't know.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:24.960]   And March if you're like. And immediately had me think about
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:26.720]   whether as soon as I saw that, I was like, I wonder if you could
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:29.880]   build an AR like a USD Z one with with a particle system so
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.600]   that you can have like little snow going down and you can
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.200]   rotate around. Of course you would think that you would
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.560]   think that shake it and make it like it all floating around
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.320]   that sure you would. All right. Let's take a break and your
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.480]   picks of the week. I can't stop shaking my phone. Your picks
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:47.040]   of the week coming up. And just a little bit Andy and not

[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.240]   you're not I didn't I I need to put under a dictionary. I need
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.280]   to run that. Andy Andy, I'll you give it the name and I'll do

[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:56.280]   about the ball. I'm both double Isaac. Yeah. All right.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.160]   Right. We're gonna go. Can we do a sponsorship thing for one of
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.480]   your episodes? We'll just for the double Isaac NFT will break
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.960]   the place. All everybody will get a drift out of this.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.720]   Except Isaac, unfortunately. Well, what is big? Well, what is
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.200]   big? Well, what is big? Let him let him what is big. Our show
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.600]   today brought to you by userway.org. Let me tell you
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.960]   something. If you have a website, it is a public entity. That
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:27.760]   means you are required to make it accessible. Required. I mean,
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.440]   I don't want to, you know, bring out the stick and everything.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.920]   It is the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal law
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.640]   that requires you to make any public entity accessible. But
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.760]   really, it's also the right thing to do. Why would you turn
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:43.880]   away business? There are over 60 million Americans with
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:48.240]   disabilities. And those people would really like to use your
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:52.200]   website. You also could be liable if if you don't meet ADA
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:55.800]   requirements for accessibility. So what do I suggest userway?
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:59.840]   Userway is an incredible AI powered solution. Tirelessly
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:04.560]   enforces the hundreds of web content accessibility guidelines,
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.880]   the WCAG guidelines, with just one line of JavaScript userway
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.720]   can achieve more than an entire team of developers. One
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.120]   million websites use userway, one million websites, some of
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:19.560]   the biggest names in the business, Disney, Coca Cola, eBay,
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:24.120]   FedEx, they know it's good for them to make their site
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:27.920]   accessible. And userway makes it easy. And now userway is making
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:31.440]   its best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.680]   small and medium sized businesses. And it's really affordable.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.840]   Plus, then it's nice to know if you scale userway can handle
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:42.640]   it, they do it for Disney. And accessible and compliant website
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.360]   isn't the is not just the right thing to do. It's it's also good
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.320]   business. And just think about the things that blind users, for
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:51.760]   instance, with screen readers have trouble with on your sites,
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:55.120]   it's not, you know, I mean, not being able to see images, one
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.040]   thing, but not being able to fill out forms to use your nav
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.840]   menus to not be able to use your shopping cart. That's a big deal.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:07.880]   Millions of people will require userway to just to purchase your
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:13.560]   products. So so let them, let them automatically generate
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.880]   image alts using AI. It writes the image descriptions for you, it

[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:12.240]   userway.org/twit. Time for picks of the week. Let's start with
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:14.040]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.160]   So Casey and I status probably someone who needs no
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.480]   introduction to many people. But if you're not familiar, he was
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.240]   originally on HBO, part of the NYSTAP Brothers. And then he
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:27.280]   became one of the very early vloggers on YouTube. And he sort
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.760]   of changed the game because his vlogs were just so extra like he
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.720]   did daily vlogging for days and hundreds and hundreds and
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.200]   hundreds of days, which is so much effort. It still
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:41.320]   stupefies me. But he also did things like for Nike, he just
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:44.280]   ran. And then there's videos of him running past the pyramids
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:47.600]   and the Colosseum and Easter Island and just running and running
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.840]   and running. So he is really extra. He goes to the pharmacy and
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.200]   there's like 300 shots in him picking his tube of toothpaste.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.480]   It is always above and beyond. And he's put together a course on
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:01.440]   filmmaking. And he's he's someone who's also really focused on
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.920]   the story, the narrative like he lost his drone becomes, is he
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.760]   gonna get it back? Oh, no, there's a skyscraper in the way. And
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.680]   New York City is blocked bike lanes again. And so it's not
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.840]   just shooting a video, it's telling a story. And he's made a
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.400]   course. It's a $250 course, which has gotten some people
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.760]   recoiling in horror who expect everything on the internet to be
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.800]   free or $10 a month for all you can watch. But it's a $250
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.560]   course. And in it, it's a 30 day course every day he gives you
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.560]   another bit of progression towards the goal which is making
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:35.200]   two of your own short films. And you know, he's endlessly
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.800]   creative. I'm sure he's not everybody's cup of tea, but it's
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.720]   hard not to be delighted in some of the things that he manages
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.320]   to do. Also famous for after snowing in New York City, he got
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:49.000]   pulled behind a truck for many, many hours just sliding around
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.200]   there. Well, police, everybody else cheered him on.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:53.840]   He's trying to get the police car. Hi, very Christmas.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:57.400]   I'm sorry. Point to you. I love that. He's delightful, endlessly
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:00.800]   creative. And he's going to show you basically his approach to
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.080]   filmmaking in this in this course. And they've got a handy gift
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.800]   button. So if it's not for you, but you have a filmmaker in your
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.280]   life and you weren't sure what to get them then this is another
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.000]   possible. Do you think he has many, many, many pairs of sunglasses
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.200]   with the paint chipped off? Or is that all the same pair of
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.800]   sunglasses always? He shows you this videos on him making
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:21.480]   them when he needs a new pair. He really spray paints them and
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:26.760]   that. Yeah. It's his trademark. Yeah. That's why you see he looks
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:29.520]   at the reverse screen on the camera to make sure he's free, but
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.720]   he doesn't want you to see him looking sideways. So he puts
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:34.280]   sunglasses on so you can't tell what he's looking at. Oh, it's
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:38.720]   part of the technique. 250 bucks. You would know that. I just
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.960]   sent a link to my son. He should absolutely do this. I just got
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:45.920]   to say that he is one of those YouTubers that my God, he's
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.240]   just such a great filmmaker. He's just such a great storyteller
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:52.920]   that there are so many YouTube channels. I got hooked on his
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:56.480]   site because every single thing if your YouTube used to like
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:00.200]   blog video, a lot of vloggers will say, Hi, here's my YouTube
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.360]   video where I went and got a cup of coffee. And I saw what I
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.640]   thought was a rabbit, but it turned out to be a squirrel. Like
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:08.880]   okay, I don't know why I would possibly care. But if Casey
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.920]   Neistat or one of these other creators did, they would make it
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:14.680]   into such a wonderful story about even something so simple that
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:16.720]   it's like, Are you going to be posting tomorrow or are you going
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.760]   to do another one today? Do another today? Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:24.840]   Very interesting. Good pick. Thank you. How about you, Andy?
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.840]   What are you at for us? Mine is a tutorial that I think everyone
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.840]   should bookmark because you're going to need it at some point.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.200]   The developer Howard Oakley over at his eclectic like company
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.480]   blog has a document that he wrote called How to Deal with a
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.080]   site with a broken certificate. This is something that you're
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.520]   that often comes up with, we try to access Wikipedia and Chrome
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:48.200]   or Safari will say, Hi, I think that this, this might be this
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.520]   this site might be trying to impersonate someone and steal
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.440]   your data and will be a cryptic message underneath it saying
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:56.040]   a site certificate unvalid or whatever. There are a whole
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:58.280]   bunch of reasons why this can happen, but it's frustrating
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.640]   because you think that you've been hacked or something. But
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.000]   no, it's just that a complicated system of trust. There is a
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.360]   it failed one of the trust steps. And so as a result, it
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.360]   doesn't want to load that page. There are ways to there are a
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:13.920]   lot of different problems that that can cause it. But if you
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:16.800]   want to work around it, it will involve basically finding out
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.120]   what site what certificate is bad and finding out how to
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.120]   figuring out how to either temporarily disable it, which can
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.240]   be dangerous. But it can you can do it if it's something you
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:28.920]   really need to get access to or install and find and install a
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:31.760]   new certificate that will fix the problem permanently. This
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.280]   is this is also very, very relevant because Thanksgiving is
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:38.760]   over. However, Christmas is coming up. So you are going to be
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:41.840]   like visiting relatives, some of them will be elderly. And we'll
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:45.800]   say, Hey, how come I can't access this anymore? And and you
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:47.920]   will check out their computer and finding out they're still
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:52.160]   running Mac OS like 10.1. And you say, well, auntie, if you were
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:54.760]   to upgrade to something more if you were to upgrade to the
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.680]   modern operating system, it will actually solve this problem.
[01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:59.720]   But then they say, Oh, but everything's working fine. I don't
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:02.400]   want to go through the hassle of upgrading saying, okay, auntie,
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:07.560]   I'm going to walk you through the process of installing a manual
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:11.200]   websites manual site certificate and approving it through a
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.360]   terminal command. And no, you're probably gonna have to do
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:16.280]   that yourself. So again, great document explains everything
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.640]   explains, even if you're not fixing it yourself, it will
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:21.440]   explain what the problem is you understand what went wrong. It
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.520]   will help you understand a fundamental technology that
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:28.360]   underpins the entire the entire web and keeps it safe. Just
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.200]   good reading overall. But again, book market, a year or two
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.400]   from now, you'll have you'll encounter a problem where a friend
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.720]   will ask you about this problem. And you'll remember, I don't
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.760]   know what it is, but I know pretty much how I can probably
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:43.880]   solve it. I have to say, I find us referring again and again to
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.120]   Howard site. This is I don't know he's got a lot of energy
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.680]   because it's not just about Max. It's not just about I mean, it's
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:55.520]   about a painting and I don't know what's going on with Don Quixote,
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:58.760]   but he's got something there. Right. The eclectic light company
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:02.160]   Max painting and more. Howard Oakley obviously doesn't need to
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.280]   sleep. But this is a great it's one of those things where I
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:10.520]   think he's kind of know this. But there are a lot of people who
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:15.360]   have no idea. And it's so kind of in the weeds that maybe people
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.520]   don't explain it or so it's just a great in place. And now this is
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:22.200]   a place on the internet. It will be here forever. Let's hope
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:25.120]   Howard. And and it'll be a reference that people will turn
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.240]   to forever because it's right. It's exactly a useful thing to
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.160]   know. This is really good. Howard is I don't know how he does
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:37.480]   it. Do you know it? I don't know. I'm boy. Do I love him?
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:41.160]   Why do I respect him? And I'm many in many ways I aspire to
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:44.360]   him the way that he produces such great content on such a far
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.640]   range of stuff. It's he is something that's aspirational for
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:50.960]   anybody who believes themselves to have a point of view that
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.080]   they like to share. This is what this is kind of amazing.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:58.520]   Great paintings. He does Mac riddles on Saturdays. Does some
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.840]   great explainers. This is increasingly this is the site to
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.800]   that we talk about fairly frequently on this show. So thank
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.840]   you, Howard. And we should try to reach out and see if we can
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.040]   get him on one of the shows I'd love to talk to him. And some
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:17.080]   of his voluminous free time he can do our show. Well, you see
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.400]   these people and you just make you just feel like such an
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:23.600]   underachiever like exactly understand how he finds time to
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.920]   do all of this. The ideal is for when you see a creator like
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:30.480]   this is to have them inspire you and see what's possible as
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.920]   opposed to all my stuff is news. I don't I'm not doing my
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:35.560]   job as well. So I think that he's doing no let let this
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:38.320]   party this I promise you that every creator does not want to
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.720]   be the reason why you never tried every creator wants you to
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.680]   be the reasons why they wanted to try something you didn't
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.640]   think you're capable of doing make it be an inspiration, not a
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:48.920]   discouragement, which is what I would do by the way and say, Oh,
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:53.400]   I'll never give up. I give up. Alex Lindsey, I saved the best or
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:58.400]   at least the most expensive for last. It's not that expensive.
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.480]   But so one of the things I'm playing with that hopefully will
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.240]   happen in the next week or two is I've been talking to a lot of
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:09.480]   teachers about how to do use keynote, you know, to talk about
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:13.200]   things. And I felt like I need something that I can do that I
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.920]   can do all the time. And I said, I don't come here to use keynote
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:19.520]   to like build little something. And I decided I'm going to do
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:22.000]   Mac break picks in the next couple weeks where I do every
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]   Mac break pick, they'll be a video on YouTube or whatever
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.120]   that is like, this is what I did. You know, this is why I think
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:30.080]   it's interesting. And I prompt my hat and I have a lot of
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:33.720]   respect for an A. I always but what even more when I think
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:36.760]   about like reading all these teleprompt stuff in like reading
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:39.440]   all that data, I was like, Oh, you know, what do I do? And I
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:42.680]   use telepromptors a lot, but I can't use them by myself. And
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.880]   I'm not sure what Renee uses. I started testing this thing
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.600]   called prompt smart, which I like a lot. I have Renee, have you
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.920]   used this at all from a I have not I've used teleprompter plus
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.040]   plus but you know, that's it's an aging product. Right. Well,
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.120]   this one. So this one is what it does is it actually listens to
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:03.600]   you talk. So so it listens to you talk and just moves along
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:07.800]   with you don't need a knob or something. It just that's the
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:09.960]   thing that they're about now, you have to get used to it because
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.040]   it jumps, you know, it kind of jumps to the next thing and you
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.880]   get you but you get used to that and once you get used to
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:17.120]   that, all you do is you turn it on and you can stop. You can
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.360]   say a couple extra things you can do whatever you want. But when
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.640]   you start talking in the text again, let me see if I can make
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:25.600]   this work and we'll see if this works or not. Let's see here if
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:29.960]   I cut to this, I hit the wrong thing. If I cut to this and say,
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.280]   now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:37.760]   nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:43.000]   endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.800]   come so you can see that it's actually just cruising along
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.600]   with me as I talk sentence by sentence because it knows what
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:51.360]   when you think about it, it's a re you're surprised that
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:54.880]   someone hasn't done it earlier. Yeah, but it's voice check. It
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.000]   doesn't have to guess. It knows what yours are going to say.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.240]   You're going and so it has to fit into it and and I and I so
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.040]   but without having to control what I what I found was is that
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.560]   you know, I tried doing and I have all the other teleprompter
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:08.320]   software. I tried to do it myself like I'm gonna move up and
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:12.880]   down and you can use your own promise by myself. It creates
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:15.320]   two months. Yeah, you know, it's what I call it like you're
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:18.360]   I have to do two things at one time and what I'm saying isn't
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.920]   as good when I'm trying to think about whether I'm going
[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:23.160]   forward or not and eventually you can get relatively good at
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.840]   it, but you're never as good as if it just goes. You know, and
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:28.640]   so now I'm able to write something down and it just goes
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:31.720]   as as I talk. Is it as good as a teleprompter operator? We
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:35.400]   hire a lot of teleprompter operators. No, it's not it's not
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.080]   the same as a as a highly skilled teleprompter operator.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.680]   That said, if you're by yourself, it's a subscription. I
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:44.440]   don't think it's that much money. There is a free version
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:47.440]   you can try a free version you can try. Yeah, and then and then
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:53.000]   I got the pro studio, whatever, of course, but but it's but I
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.120]   but I think that it's it's working really well. And we'll
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.240]   see if it comes out. I'm going to be again, trying to do
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:02.800]   these what I'm trying to do is put together little videos as an
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:06.520]   exercise thought exercise. And then I'm going to put up do
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:09.600]   them all in keynote. That's what I'm limiting myself to is do
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.520]   everything in keynote, but do the voiceover, you know, with this
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:14.640]   just recorded in and then put it in the keynote and then put it
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:17.440]   together. So anyway, that's that's kind of the game that I'm
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:20.080]   playing in this. This is a key piece of it because I was like, I
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.840]   don't know how to do this otherwise. I tried a bunch of other
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.720]   ones and I was like, well, this is not going to work. I can't
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:26.520]   can't do the video. And then I found this and I was like, Oh,
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:27.480]   this went when I'm here.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:33.640]   hated me because I would never follow the script. And so
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:37.000]   it's not all unusual. We've been seeing that happen. It
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.040]   happened to I think a Samsung event where they just they're
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.320]   they're they're lost. And so they're jumping all up around the
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:47.160]   proctor. And and it's it's terrible for the and the host. I
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.480]   think this is good. I just generally I'm not a fan of
[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:53.400]   proctors at all periods. It makes it look crazy. But I know I
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:56.960]   think that I think I don't I generally am against it. But if
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:59.920]   I want to say something that sometimes I have like, yeah,
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:03.480]   when I'm in a live show, I am completely against teleprompters.
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.880]   Yeah, like you should never use them in a live show. You
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:08.520]   still all say what you're gonna say. Yeah, the presence. Yeah.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:11.520]   When I'm trying to pack a bunch of information into a short
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.120]   period of time, and I just want to say it this way. Yeah. And I
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:17.040]   think through it. And and especially when the person who's
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.680]   doing it is writing it. So what's what I'm finding is like, I
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:21.840]   say it and then I edit it. Oh, I don't like the way I said that
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.400]   or I don't like the way I said that. And then I go back and
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:27.360]   edit it some more. And and it really is this kind of creative
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:30.320]   process that I didn't expect. But I couldn't do it. I just was
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.080]   just so frustrated with the dialing the dial thing. Does
[02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:36.120]   anybody John does anybody still use the prompter in our studios?
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:42.440]   Are they use it for Technus Weekly? Oh, they don't. Okay,
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:45.960]   so we should mention this. When we were in studio, I think
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:50.000]   Technus Weekly routinely used a prompter, Burke or somebody
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.480]   would come in and turn them on. But which is you're right, the
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:55.760]   ideal way to do it. But I think this is an interesting
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.400]   alternative. Yeah, except that I would immediately screw it up
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:01.440]   because I wouldn't follow the script and then it would not
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.440]   know what was going on. So I got to say, I'm a little bit
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:07.520]   bump. I'm a little bit bummed out because right now, oh, wait,
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:11.880]   it seems to work. I correct myself. I'm now I'm now anti bummed
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:15.880]   out. I'm excited. I and I while you're speaking, I installed it
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:18.760]   on my Mac and it does work is an iPad app, but it's not there's
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:21.560]   nothing banning it from functioning. And the idea of
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.440]   having this like as a right right now through the furthest
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:28.800]   chat, I've got like the the the the the view my my my Skype
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:32.200]   window is like right underneath as usual my webcam so I can
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:34.840]   maintain eye contact, sometimes like contact like while I'm
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:38.440]   looking at the thing. But now the idea of dragging this window
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:43.400]   right underneath that and being able to pretty well read stuff
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:46.520]   while also maintaining mostly eye contact on the Mac that in
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:50.200]   itself is pretty big. And the workflow that I'm kind of
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:54.480]   thinking through is using voice recognition, voice to text to
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:57.480]   to say the things that I want to say about a product or say
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.160]   things of an idea and just record it all. Because one
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.760]   problem I have is that my writing voice and my speaking
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:06.960]   voice are completely different. Like I am a completely
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.720]   different person when through my hands. And so and no one likes
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.400]   the person that I type with. And anyway, so so the so the so
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.560]   only some people like the one that speaks anyway. So so the
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.440]   so the ideas of able to say it X, you know, like say all the
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:26.800]   ideas that I have, and then go back and go, okay, I'm an editor
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:29.560]   all down to this is what I like, and then be able to read it
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:32.200]   back as a way to do it. So I look at it as kind of a creative
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.320]   process that's still me, but allows me to be a little bit
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:39.560]   pull a little bit of the air out, you know, because I do
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:41.800]   think that when you're putting out content for people, you
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.920]   want to be conscious of their time. And I think that that,
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.720]   you know, like when I watch videos and people meander around,
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:51.680]   I don't watch them very long. Yeah, it's it's also important.
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:54.840]   Like I have a I have some ADHD that I work with. And
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:57.920]   sometimes it's like, I know that I'm speaking extemporaneously
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:00.600]   when I'm recording when I record like the material podcast,
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.960]   it's like, I know I'm speaking extemporaneously, but I'm going
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:05.960]   to pretty much write out exactly what I'm going to say,
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:08.200]   because I know exactly where I'm going with this. I've got a
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.680]   beginning, middle and an end. I don't need to be spontaneous
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:14.000]   here. So yes, I'm going to say what I'm going to say, record
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.880]   that as like speech to text, then take the text and read the
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.000]   text. And something like this would be such a boon. It's one
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.640]   of the reasons why I don't do it's one of the many reasons why I
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.880]   don't do YouTube, even though I'd like to experiment with it,
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:29.240]   partly because I have to think off the top when I'm all alone,
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:31.520]   I've got eight hours to say whatever I want. I wind up saying
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.640]   a lot of things, man. And that means that requires a lot of
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.840]   editing. And that's believe it or not, Alex, this is like, wow,
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:40.200]   that's actually one step closer to my being able to do YouTube
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.760]   videos, I think. Nice. Yeah. And this just in it has stopped
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:49.560]   stop snowing in the Mac app store. So it's not a permanent
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.720]   dysfunction.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:54.600]   No, no, no, we should don't be don't be happy. It's the climate
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.760]   is changing. Like we didn't use to get on the store until
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.840]   January. Let me try again, let it snow and see before you even
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.280]   hit search, it immediately starts snowing. But I guess it
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.880]   stops after a little while. So that's fun. Hey, we're done.
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.200]   Thank you, everybody. Renee Richie's videos are at YouTube.com
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.400]   slash Renee Richie just did one that I can't wait to see all
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:24.480]   about these new this new Mac stuff. It's coming down the pipe.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:29.320]   Anything else you got working? What are you up to? I just posted
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.280]   my my big in depth deep dive into the M1 Max and M1 Pro where I
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.040]   get down into all the transistors and stuff and those
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:41.120]   roles. Yeah, yeah. Lake reactions and detailed analyses of
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.080]   the stuff that's already here. That's YouTube.com slash
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:49.240]   Renee Richie. Andy and I go, when are you going to be on GBH in
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.280]   Boston next Friday? As usual, this time 1230 in the afternoon,
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.040]   you can either stream it live at wgbhnews.org or later that
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:59.480]   night, just go to the same place and you can stream it at
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:02.760]   your convenience. They usually punch out my 20 minutes of tech
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:05.720]   news roundup with the people and put it in a separate file. So
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:08.880]   nice. If you don't want to hear about Boston politics for two
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:12.200]   hours before hearing about me, go for it. Although it's fun. It's
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.440]   a very it's a nice soap opera sort of thing. You think the real
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.560]   housewives had a whole bunch of drama going on. Try Boston
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:21.720]   politics. And of course, Alex Lindsey, what's going on at
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:24.640]   office hours? Well, we've got, you know, of course, we've been
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.120]   cooking, we moved our cooking to Sunday morning so that I can go
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.800]   back to the farmer's market. But anyway, it was like, I was
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:33.600]   like, my daughter was like, okay, it's it's now COVID's over. We
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.400]   now to move that time. And so it's her time. And so anyway,
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.760]   we're still doing we're going to Belfast this weekend to watch
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:43.760]   another band set of artists. We have a new host. We, you know,
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.120]   Emily Russo took over Saturday. You can see Liberty,
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.880]   White here is now hosting Mondays. And so I'm slow. You
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:53.920]   know, I'm now a panelist, but not a, which I'm pretty excited
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:56.720]   about. And they're doing a great job. And then, and then we
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:59.120]   have, you know, we're going to talk about tomorrow. We have
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.680]   neural net and Friday, we have a maker pipe. And then Thursday,
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:07.720]   we have Michael Krasnion. Oh, yeah, Michael. Sure. Yes. So
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:11.400]   the he are host is WGBKQED.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.720]   You're in KQED. He was he was he recently retired. I was like,
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.480]   the thing is, is that our second hour in office hours is based
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:21.560]   on forum. Like the way I structure it. It's because I

[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:34.280]   manager, a lot of really exciting things coming up.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:40.320]   Let's see who Mary Jo Foley did her ask me anything on Friday.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:43.400]   So that's going to show up on the twit plus feed. You can find
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:49.320]   me in the clubs as Patrick Gilaatti. There's also upcoming
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:51.480]   Mike Elgin and his wife, Amir, are going to talk about their
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:56.720]   gastronomat adventures next month. We've got Stacy's book
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.280]   group. They've decided on autonomous as their next book
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:04.240]   from Annalynnowitz. There's just a lot of stuff going on. The
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.800]   discord is so much fun. But that's actually not the real
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.000]   reason to join club twit. The real reason we thought anyway was
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.880]   for ad free versions and tracker free versions of all of our
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.480]   shows. All you have to do to get that is $7 a month go to
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:21.360]   twit.tv slash club twit. And as I said, there's additional
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.680]   content, including I'm having a feeling the twit plus feed
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:29.840]   might feature the instantaneous decoration of this studio.
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:37.040]   Yes, by by Burke, a grumpy Burke in a huff who said, all right,
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:41.400]   you want decorations, you got it. And I want I want I want that
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.000]   video as an electronic Christmas card. That was so amazing to
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.720]   watch it work. Already on Twitter, I'm beginning to be
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:50.760]   already on Twitter. Like God, this is the most amazing thing in
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:54.520]   the world. Well, I'm sure that will be on the twit plus feed
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:57.000]   along with many other did you used to work for NASCAR? You
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:03.280]   want to play like a pit crew guy? He did make the sound every
