[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.960]   It's another episode of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.520]   Hello to our friends, for our enemies,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.440]   and to the great preponderance of listeners,
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.560]   to whom we are largely indifferent.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.760]   I'm Andy Naco of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.680]   And I have with me an all-star cast.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.360]   Making up for some notable absences,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.800]   Leo is this is not a joke in South America harassing penguins.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.320]   He has a special premise to harass them.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.880]   He brought an arrangement of pointy and blunt sticks
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   with which to poke them.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.640]   There is some science involved.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.960]   I didn't want to ask for fear of being called
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.480]   to testify later on.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.360]   And Alex is somewhere else on the planet
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.920]   doing incredible and positive things.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.960]   But joining me this week, again, stellar all-star cast,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.640]   from macworld.com, the website, and the magazine,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.200]   Chris Breen, who is the--
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.840]   what's the level above publisher?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840]   It's sort of like all they had to do
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.480]   is to say Chris Breen now, because you're
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.600]   so closely associated with Macworld.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   Pretty much.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.680]   Now, I'm trying to get to the point
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.960]   where it's simply Breen so that like a not-co, like,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.520]   poke, like share, like Madonna, I aspire to a single name.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.760]   I understand that you're so big that on Twitter,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.560]   not only was Chris Breen taken, not only
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.200]   was the real Chris Breen taken, but you
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440]   had to go the really, I promise you, actual Chris Breen.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.840]   Because people were just squatting on that name,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   squatting on that name, squatting.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.960]   It's part of the-- I mean, you are such an expert on iOS
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.240]   and all those devices that it means.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.960]   It's going to happen.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   I mean, you got to expect-- it's almost a compliment,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.880]   really, isn't it?
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.560]   Well, clearly, that's going to happen.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.240]   And I check who unfollowed me on Twitter every so often.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   And I see that just like Justin Bieber,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.520]   I mean, Justin's still aspiring to this level.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.400]   But I see these feet of Breen, ankles of Breen,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520]   tibia of Breen, uvula of Breen.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.760]   And naturally, the track people like a swarm of hornets.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   And then they discover it's not me.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.040]   And it's actually not my uvula.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.520]   And that's it.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.400]   But if they lose all their followers at once.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.760]   So actually, you can find them.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.160]   I'm just going to move on now.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.200]   That's great.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.680]   That's the best.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.840]   But we are blessed to have two publishing titans.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.680]   We have Tanya Aangst, the publisher,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.240]   Grand Puba, editor in chief.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.200]   Everything of Take Control Ebooks.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.600]   Tanya, how is it there with Neo and the rest of the gang
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.880]   from the Matrix in the white void?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.240]   We're living in the white void.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.840]   We're deeply descended into the digital world.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   We only come out once a week for fresh air and water.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.800]   And everything's great.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.560]   We're enjoying the winter very much.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.680]   And it's very fun to be here.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.800]   Can you see the I'm a Mac?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.240]   I'm a PC commercial being filmed to your left.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.680]   No, just no.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.000]   OK.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.240]   Filling out our force.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.560]   And we have last--
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.200]   you're interning at Mac user.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   And you just got the--
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   I'm glad they kept you on when they switched to Mac world.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.680]   Haven't heard much from you since then.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.840]   It was all a clerical error, actually.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   And I also squat on Chris Breen on a regular basis.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.840]   So--
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.000]   Ow.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.040]   What is your title these days, Jason?
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.880]   Well, it's anything you want it to be.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.680]   I like to go by Jason from Mac world.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.720]   I really think you need to perfect your piercing,
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.520]   like your piercing perfume model layer when you're going to--
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.280]   I just go by Jason.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.200]   Blue steel.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.880]   Yes.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.400]   Editorial director, I believe, which means that I get
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.360]   to direct editors.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.520]   I used to be the executive editor, which meant I got to
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.240]   execute them.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.840]   But they don't let me do that anymore.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.880]   It's just degenerated into slap fights.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.760]   And no one got killed.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520]   So they had to give you easy out there.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.040]   OK.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.400]   Well, we got some really interesting stories this week.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.040]   Obviously, in terms of new cool Apple stuff, this is the
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.960]   week that the first Verizon iPhone started hitting the
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.080]   hands of those people who were reviewing them and those
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   people who ordered them on February 2nd.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.720]   More importantly, this is the time that we can actually look
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.280]   at them side by side, use them side by side, and see if there's
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.240]   really any practical difference between a Verizon
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.720]   iPhone and an AT&T iPhone.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.600]   Or if we were just whining and complaining over pretty much
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.280]   nothing over the past two or three years.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.120]   And the general constant of the universe is that all wireless
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.240]   carriers suck.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.520]   Jason, you've been playing for one for a while.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.120]   What were your impressions?
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.240]   Well, it's an iPhone 4.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.080]   I mean, I think that's the number one impression.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's got a couple differences.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.040]   The black bars on the sides are in a slightly different
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.280]   location, and they're slightly more symmetrical.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.320]   And there's no SIM card slot.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.120]   I mean, they're so little different.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.640]   The real difference, it's a slightly different build at the
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.200]   iOS.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.120]   So it's got a feature that isn't yet on other iPhones,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   although I suspect it will be very soon.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.280]   And the network.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   I mean, it's really about the Verizon network.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.480]   And in my testing, I only tested it in San Francisco.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.440]   It was more reliable than AT&T's network, except at my
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.680]   house where I have no bars at Verizon.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.560]   And the AT&T network was faster.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.000]   So that seems to be the trade-off, but it'll vary from
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.520]   city to city.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.080]   Now, did you try the this one, some controversy over the
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.160]   claims that, well, we all know that as a CDMA phone, so you
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.680]   won't be able to do a phone call and use the internet at
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.280]   the same--
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.560]   use the web at the same time.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.240]   David Pogue did his review and claimed that.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.440]   And of course, the virulent battle of New York Times
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.360]   posters who put down both their red wine and their
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.440]   claret in order to complain that he had to set up his butt.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.720]   Have you found that to be a limitation?
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.320]   It is a limitation.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.880]   The original iPhone on Edge only had the same
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.480]   limitation.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.960]   I guess what I'd say is, I think as a--
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.600]   I'm not sure how many situations you've got where you
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.040]   want to be on the phone and on the data network
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.440]   simultaneously.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   I guess if you're on a conference call and it's really
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.200]   boring and you want to check your email, something
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.560]   like that, that sort of makes sense.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.160]   But once you start using that personal hotspot feature,
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.360]   that becomes a little bit more of an issue, because you can
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.720]   have up to five devices sharing your internet connection
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.320]   using the personal hotspot.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.000]   And the moment your phone rings, that's it for the
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.120]   internet until you either send that to voicemail or answer
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.000]   the call and talk and then hang up.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.120]   The hotspot kind of persists, but it can't get on the
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.960]   internet.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.440]   To me, that's the place where it starts to break down.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.240]   Now, that's the interesting feature that really has got me
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.000]   attracted to the Verizon iPhone or iOS 4.3 if the hotspot
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.880]   feature should show up there.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.680]   That's when it turns the iPhone into essentially a MIFI.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.720]   Now, are we back in the days of 1992, 1993, when everyone
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.280]   in the world who had a modem had to say,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.880]   Bob, step the phone.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.040]   You just knocked me off the internet.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   Like, what happens when if you're using the hotspot
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.280]   feature and you get a phone call, is it the same thing as
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.800]   what happens when you get a phone call on the AT?
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.880]   And it's like, oh, there's a polite sort of thing saying,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.840]   OK, do you want to stop downloading news of the world
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.440]   and talk to your--
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.080]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.120]   It basically just drops the connection and then phone
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.840]   rings, and that's it.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.000]   And so actually, this leads to an interesting point.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.280]   If you were doing something like using the internet hotspot,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.720]   the personal hotspot, to do something like Mac break weekly,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   where you needed an internet connection and you didn't have
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.760]   one, so you used the Verizon network instead.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.080]   If one of your enemies knew your phone number, they would
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.320]   actually just be able to call you and knock you off your
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.240]   connection.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.520]   Just by ringing the phone, you can't send it to voice mail.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.320]   The ring itself knocks you off the internet.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.000]   So don't tell your enemies your phone number.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.600]   I think you're severely misjudging the character or the
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.840]   people who use this internet.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.320]   I think the people are going to know--
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.280]   it sounds like a problem, but it really isn't so long as
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.080]   everybody's polite.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.240]   And I think that's going to work out.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.120]   Chris, have you tried the new Verizon iPhone yet?
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   I have not.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.280]   I've been in the presence of Jason, who's touched one.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.480]   And that's the closest I've gotten to this thing.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.640]   I carry some of the network with me.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.120]   He does.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.960]   It rubs off on me.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.520]   It rubs off on me.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.720]   My hands near him and I can feel the vibration and the
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.080]   enhanced quality of the calling experience just by being
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.520]   near him.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.880]   So no, I'm actually thinking of maybe a jump because I get
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.200]   no AT&T coverage here.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.120]   And I went on and purchased one of AT&T's microcells.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.280]   Apparently, they're giving the things away for free now
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.560]   because they are so desperate to keep people.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.400]   And so I can sort of make a very poor phone call from my
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.200]   home, but I've checked Verizon's coverage map.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.800]   And apparently, it just Verizon everywhere here, that
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.920]   there's a tower under my basement, perhaps.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.600]   So I'd like the opportunity to actually drag one over here
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.200]   and find out if I can make a call.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.880]   That may compel me to jump over.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.640]   I guess this is a good chance to test your friendship
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.720]   between yourself and Jason.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.520]   If you maybe maybe you'd were to invite him over to dinner
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.920]   or for coffee once in a while.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.720]   It'd be clear that you're exploiting him for his
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.800]   Verizon phone, but still.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   That's not a bad idea.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.440]   And if-- I'm not sure he's not listening, so I'll just say
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.640]   this.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.040]   But he's a hard guy to have a meal with because he's
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.520]   constantly on the internet with his phone.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.480]   Now that I know his number, and he's
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.920]   diddling away during our meal, I can instead knock him off
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   the line.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   That was a good trip.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.680]   Chris, did you miss my name?
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.440]   I'm sorry, I was distracted.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.040]   So that's actually a great tip.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.120]   If you have someone who is annoying you by getting all
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.320]   over the internet while eating dinner, all you have to do
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.560]   is call them to knock them off the line.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.800]   There's probably even going to be an app that will repeatedly
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.560]   call someone to keep them from using the internet.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.040]   Actually, that's a good point.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.680]   That's exactly the reason why corporate IT departments are
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.560]   going to be issuing Verizon iPhones to all their users
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.360]   who are going to be doing a lot of blackberries.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.200]   Because that way they can sort of monitor every single person
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.240]   who's twittering or on Facebook or doing live podcasts.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.640]   And they're saying something that's
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.160]   against the company's interest.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   Hi, Saul.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.040]   Just wanted to check and say, you're doing a great job telling
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.920]   everybody about how lax our inspections standards are
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.960]   over at the plant.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.440]   Keep up the good work.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   And I wanted to show you some video of my kids.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.800]   Come on, come on.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.640]   Do your little back for Uncle Saul.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   Uncle Saul, come on, give him a little bit of cheer.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.840]   He's going to be fired tomorrow.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.840]   He's going to speak the things he was saying.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   We need a new word.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.040]   It's like a Verizon, Philip, Buster, Zun, something.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   Well, you think that given this limitation
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.520]   that there would be an option on the phone to immediately send
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.160]   to voicemail so that this doesn't happen, you can say,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.800]   I know I'm going to be on the internet for the next half
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.440]   hour, so a little slider.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.440]   Just to be able to have that option.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   I think you might be able to set it to forward.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.560]   And maybe that would work.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.200]   But you're right, just a slider that would say, OK,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.040]   I don't want-- when I'm using data,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.920]   I don't want my phone to ring.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.040]   I just wanted to go to voicemail.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.560]   But I don't think it's there.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.360]   Tony, I mean, we're dealing with two people
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.600]   who live in San Francisco, which is one of those hip metro
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.360]   urban areas.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.000]   I live just outside a Puritan fishing colony,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.360]   and you live up in the wilds of New York next to a pond,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.240]   I believe.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.320]   So what's-- is Verizon in the future for you?
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.680]   Well, some serious testing is in the future for me.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.280]   And sooner than I thought, I thought
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.320]   I was going to hold off for the iPhone 5,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.200]   because I'm the next person at my company who
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.960]   is getting the new iPhone.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.760]   But my iPhone 3GS is sort of broken.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.680]   So I need to get a new phone soon,
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.360]   and I need to look really carefully at the coverage.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.880]   Living in the canoe York, very close to Cornell University.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.520]   And we have great coverage at Cornell,
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.560]   but pretty much fades out dramatically from there.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.240]   So at my son's elementary school,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.760]   cell phones didn't work.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.120]   Certainly that cut down in the kids
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.040]   need to bring cell phones to school.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.480]   But I need to do some serious research and figure out
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.640]   which phone's going to work the best for me.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.800]   Probably what I really need is some kind of a special situation
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.520]   where you could have the AT&T phone and the Verizon phone
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.280]   kind of sandwiched together in a case,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.920]   and then it would magically the one that you want would just
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   work.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.560]   And of course, I'll just speculate and say maybe that will happen
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.680]   with an iPhone 5, but that would be sort of fantasy
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.640]   speculation, I guess.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.960]   Now, that's the big decision point for me for the Verizon iPhone.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.840]   We are dealing with a very, very predictable release
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   cycle in which it would be news if Apple did not release
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.880]   the iPhone 5 in June during WWDC.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   Right now, there's a rumor that WWDC is going to be on June 5.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.920]   It's amazing to me that there's so many people who are rushing
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   out to buy the iPhone 4 right now.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.080]   I mean, they've all waited for three years for a Verizon iPhone.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.920]   They can't wait another three months to get the one that sort
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.800]   of just gently hovers and a beatific sort of cloud above your hands,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.480]   which is rumored to be a feature of the iPhone 5.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.640]   It's rumored because this is a well-known podcast,
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   and I'm starting that rumor right now.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   So, Tonya, you're in the position where you actually kind of need
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.240]   a new iPhone.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.320]   Can you hold that for three months?
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.120]   >> My 3GS is broken to the point where the Wi-Fi radio
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.640]   doesn't work, the Bluetooth radio doesn't work.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.560]   And as I found out on a recent trip to San Francisco,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.800]   the 3G radio doesn't work.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   So all I can do is connect with Edge.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.200]   >> What are you doing to this phone?
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.640]   >> I don't know what I'm doing to it.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.840]   It's terrible.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.040]   And first, I thought, well, I don't really need Wi-Fi.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.240]   I'm mostly at home, and if I need to use the internet,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.760]   I'll just use my iPad.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.560]   And then I saw, oh, I only really need Bluetooth for testing stuff.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.880]   So I just won't have Bluetooth.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.840]   But then when I was actually in a mobile urban environment
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.240]   where they have decent cell phone connectivity,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   I couldn't even do that on my phone.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   So before I travel the next time, I need a new phone that--
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   because who knows?
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.160]   I mean, the whole thing is just sort of falling apart.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.360]   So if I lose even my Edge service,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.000]   then it's not even going to work for calls.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.240]   >> Have you heard of the iPod Touch before?
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.720]   Because really, it doesn't--
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.440]   >> Not that one of those.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.480]   >> All those things.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.360]   And when you're in San Francisco,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.600]   you can't make a call on an iPhone anyway.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.000]   So you might as well have that.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.520]   >> I had to leave the iPod Touch home with my 12-year-old.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.440]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.600]   Well, I really think it's going to be a case
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.680]   where it's going to take us a couple of weeks
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.240]   to have enough hundreds of thousands of people
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.040]   with these things in the wild who can really
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.920]   do comparisons between here's the coverage
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.680]   I was getting on my old phone on the AT&T network.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.720]   Here's the coverage I'm getting now in Verizon.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.320]   Because it's just such a subjective thing, isn't it?
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.640]   If you're in an area in which you're getting better AT&T
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.440]   coverage, that's really the decision for you.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.680]   If you're in an area that's getting better Verizon coverage,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.120]   that's a decision for you.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.400]   But I really think the real reviews
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.080]   aren't going to come for another about a month or so
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.000]   before we can figure out really is the network
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.440]   the big difference or is it just a sticker that we care about?
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.480]   Let's see.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.160]   Of course, through a bunch of I-fix-it tear downs
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.420]   revealed that the rumored Qualcomm combined
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.640]   GSM CDMA baseband chip is indeed present inside that phone.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.560]   So in the '03, if the right number of electrons
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.760]   were put inside this phone in exactly the right order,
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.240]   this exact same handset could maybe sort of work
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.520]   on the AT&T network as well, which maybe won't be too much
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.280]   of a surprise.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.960]   I don't think a lot of us were thinking that Apple would
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.160]   have two completely different sets of hardware
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.640]   for two completely separate sets of customers.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.760]   Chris, does this make sense to you?
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.560]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.520]   I think that this is Apple's opportunity
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.400]   to throw the new chip into a new phone for them.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.280]   And probably that's the same chip we're
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.120]   going to see in the iPhone 5.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.280]   It completely makes sense, particularly
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.400]   if they want to make this a world phone so that you take it
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.160]   overseas and you don't--
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.880]   GSM is everywhere in CDMA not so much.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.560]   It would be very nice if I were able to land
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.280]   in a foreign country with this phone that will do both
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.560]   and immediately switch over.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.160]   And then naturally, Apple would have
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.680]   to make a deal with the two carriers AT&T and Verizon
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.600]   so that they would get their pound of flesh when
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.480]   you switch over to the other network.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.120]   But yeah, it would be silly for them
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.960]   to make two different phones that
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.080]   had two different chipsets.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.040]   So standardize on that so that you can use it anywhere.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.080]   I don't know that they're going to go to the point where
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.360]   you can say, I'm really getting terrible coverage here
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.160]   with AT&T.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.720]   So let me just flip this switch here.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.160]   Ah, look now I can make a call on Verizon.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.200]   And plus, again, there's no SIM card in the thing.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.360]   So we'll see.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.600]   That would be the real death match when we get to the point
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.880]   where I bought this phone, this iPhone.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.120]   I'm now out of contract.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.880]   And now I have the free choice of switching
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.240]   this exact same phone from Verizon to AT&T or AT&T to Verizon,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.080]   which actually brings up another death match
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   that I want to discuss with you guys.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   There's the question of AT&T's network
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.080]   versus Verizon's network.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.400]   But now we also can figure out, the Verizon,
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.880]   can you hear me now guy versus John Hodgeman
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.480]   as the I'm a PC guy?
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.400]   Let's say that they're both in sort of the squared circle,
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.000]   sort of bare knuckle death match sort of thing.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.840]   Collegiate boxing rules.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.800]   I've got a few stats here.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.440]   The Verizon network guy, five foot eight and a half.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.120]   He is 165, I'm sorry, later commercials.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.800]   He's 165 pounds.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.280]   Early commercial, he looked more like 145 to 150.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.600]   Reach of 27 inches.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.480]   He usually trains with 10 ounce gloves.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.640]   John Hodgeman, he has been to Portugal.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.320]   I don't know if that'll factor into your decision,
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.200]   but he has been there.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.920]   Let's start off with Tanya, who do you think would win?
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.760]   - Well, okay, so.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.880]   - We're looking for either death or submission.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.720]   That's also gonna be a big thing.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.880]   - Coming at it from the female perspective,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.320]   I first had to ask myself,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.080]   was either of them seriously hot?
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.480]   And no, no.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.840]   So I couldn't really, really give either one of them
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.440]   a hot factor to help them win.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.520]   So then I just thought that the Verizon guy travels.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.240]   He's been to jungles, he's been to Antarctica,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.640]   all these places, and I'm a PC guy.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.400]   Basically stays home and runs his PC.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.200]   So I'm gonna have to give it to the Verizon guy.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.480]   - Jason, what do you think?
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.400]   - Well, first off, I have to question your premise,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.640]   because you said that we're using collegiate boxing rules
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.680]   and yet somehow it's going to the death.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.960]   That's not part of collegiate boxing, Andy.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.800]   What kind of college is it?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.640]   - It is, it is, it is.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.800]   - It is in the college I win too.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.640]   - Okay.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.800]   - I'm sorry, you went to one of those fancy schmancy,
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.760]   oh, we're doing a seminar on Yelp today.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.600]   - Yeah, that's my way.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.760]   - We had a slide for every A.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.720]   - So I also like how you slipped it in there
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.680]   that the Verizon guy has gotten heavier over time,
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.760]   which was really noticeable in that new Verizon iPhone ad
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   where he, I can hear you now.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.400]   - He's handsome in a large sandwich.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.680]   - We're not, we're just saying it might give him
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.920]   a tactical advantage in that if he can use that to,
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   you know, that extra inertia, it's just physics.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.600]   - Okay, so breaking this down scientifically,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.880]   I look in the cold soulless eyes of the Verizon,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.520]   I can hear you now, Guy, and say, "Hodgeman."
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.920]   Okay, we've got one Verizon guy, one Hodgeman, Chris.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.480]   - I'm going with Hodgeman as well.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.440]   I think he's a smarter guy.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.160]   I think the Verizon guy's got a meat and potatoes guy.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.520]   Hodgeman doesn't need to ask these simple questions
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.480]   like, "Can you hear me?"
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.560]   He wants to explain how you can hear.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.320]   And I think he's like the Muhammad Ali
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.480]   in the last part of his career.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.760]   He doesn't have to sting like it be,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.880]   he doesn't have to be fast anymore.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.240]   I think he can pull a rope a dope
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.920]   and outthink the Verizon guy.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.440]   So when the Verizon guy thinks he's got him on the ropes,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   Hodgeman jumps out and slams him to the canvas.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.040]   And I think, so I give it to Hodgeman.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.400]   - I will also give it to Hodgeman
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.920]   by a split decision of three to one.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.960]   Chiefly because Tony had a really good point there
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.120]   in that the Verizon guy,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.040]   more of a world traveler,
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.240]   has been through more environments,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.440]   so he's got more experience.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.120]   He's got more of the no-haul.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.960]   Hodgeman, however, as a PC,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.680]   he's used to a lifetime of abuse.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.840]   So the rope a dope strategy.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.120]   You can just sort of like,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.400]   take those punches for a good 13, 14 rounds,
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.960]   let the Verizon guy tire himself out
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.440]   and then one blue screen of death
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.960]   and boom, right to the kisser and he's on the canvas.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.520]   Okay, well, now it's time for a commercial break.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.240]   We're gonna thank our good friends at FreshBooks
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.760]   via a recording, provided by Alex Lindsay.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.600]   - Thanks Andy.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.280]   Of course, this episode is brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.720]   Now, if you're a small business owner
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.400]   and I'm a small business owner
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.760]   and I started very, very small.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.040]   So I started with, I was actually about this high,
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.200]   like just not very small and very, very small.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.680]   And dealing with invoicing is just something
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.520]   that drives you crazy.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.400]   You love actually doing it.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   You love actually doing the work,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.000]   but the invoicing, the paperwork
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.920]   is the part that you don't really like to do.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.760]   I don't like to do it.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.200]   And I always have to do it this morning
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.920]   and was very upset about the whole process.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.040]   And so dealing with all this paperwork
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.200]   and specifically the invoicing is just,
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.080]   it's uncomfortable, it's tedious.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.320]   And FreshBooks.com makes all of that much, much easier.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.360]   Now, you can just upload a logo.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.240]   So you can quickly and easily create your own invoices
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.440]   that have your logo on them.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.360]   They look professional.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.240]   They look like you mean business.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.520]   I don't know if I really mean business,
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.920]   but they make you look like that you mean business.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.640]   You can have your clients just download PDFs.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.320]   You can even have your clients pay online
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.760]   without having to do anything else with a PayPal account
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.600]   or there's a bunch of other,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.840]   there's like 11 different ways
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.440]   that you can handle it via credit card.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.000]   So there's a lot of different ways you can do that.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.520]   You can receive your payments for your invoices.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.400]   As I said, your clients don't have to send you a check.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.880]   There's all this electronic processing that's available
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.720]   or they can't.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.120]   And you can even send them snail mail invoices
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.400]   from FreshBooks.com.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.200]   So there's just a lot of ways that you can make sure
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.040]   this happens.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.960]   You can have them do, FreshBooks will let you actually do
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.040]   auto like late payment stuff,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.400]   saying you're late and we'd like to have the money.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.240]   So anyway, but you don't have to do that.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.080]   You don't have to go through that.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.000]   You don't even have to feel guilty about it.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.360]   It's just an automated process
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.560]   and you can just say, "Hey, that's just the way the system works."
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.000]   So anyway, FreshBooks.com,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.960]   you just, the thing to always remember,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.680]   it is really not how much money you're making
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.840]   if you're a small consultant, it's when you're making it.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.880]   Cash flow is everything.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.680]   You have to make sure that that money
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.600]   is constantly coming in.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.360]   I used to have bills when I was an independent artist.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.240]   Now we have like people and all this stuff
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.480]   and everything else, but when I was independent artists,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.200]   I had bills, it's not that my clients pay net 90.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.520]   I just invoiced 90 days after I actually finished the project
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.880]   because it was just like, "Oh, I'll get around to it tomorrow.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.720]   "I'll get around to it tomorrow."
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.800]   And then you didn't get it done.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.440]   Making this easy is a huge piece
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.880]   of you becoming successful in this market.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   And FreshBooks.com is on your side.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.360]   They're gonna really make this a lot easier.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.640]   You gotta check it out.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   So they got a special offer for you.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.360]   You're not gonna believe this.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.480]   All right, so they've got a special FreshBooks.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.320]   Of course, it's free today.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   You can have up to three clients
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.280]   and I think I had three clients for like the first two years
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.640]   that I was actually doing work.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.880]   And it just, so you could do it for free.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.920]   You could actually have this for free.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   It takes about a minute to set up the account.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.720]   You can go to FreshBooks.com, sign up for a free account.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.200]   When they ask you how do you hear about FreshBooks,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   make sure that they understand that it was Macbreak.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.320]   Macbreak did that for you.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.560]   Everyday FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.920]   So if one of our audience members,
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.640]   if it's your birthday or even if it isn't your birthday,
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.480]   just sign up.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.360]   So sign up there.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.120]   They're gonna draw a name every day for an entire month
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   and they're going to send you a birthday cake in the mail.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.400]   You won't have to come pick it up.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.440]   I don't even know where FreshBooks is
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.960]   and you're still gonna get the birthday cake.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.920]   So definitely check it out.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.120]   Make sure that they know that Macbreak sent you.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.040]   And it's FreshBooks.com.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.160]   If you are a small business, you have got to check it out.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.480]   All right, back to the regular scheduled program.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.800]   Our next big story is last week,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   of course, consequently one day after
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.520]   we recorded Macbreak last week,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.560]   the Daily made its big debut.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.760]   That's the iPad-only digital magazine,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.680]   I'm sorry, digital newspaper, Daily newspaper,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.920]   produced by Rupert Murdoch and his friends.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.080]   Big launch event.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.440]   We've had a chance to download it and use it.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   It's been, we've been hearing a lot about this
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.840]   for several weeks and several months
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.240]   and I was expecting something a little bit nicer.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.600]   But I was kind of surprised that the page turns
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.400]   aren't quite as flashy,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   aren't quite as smooth as what we'd see
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.280]   even on an app like Flipbook.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.600]   The content is nice.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.920]   I think it's all gonna come down to the content.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.720]   There were a whole bunch of social media features,
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.040]   a lot of which didn't work.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.840]   Or at least when I first tried it on the first day,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.040]   there was a picture that I wanted to retweet.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.720]   Thought that, okay, well, let's do the social thing.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.960]   Let's be part of the conversation.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.200]   So you click a button where you just simply tap that button
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   and say, okay, Facebook, Twitter, whatever you want,
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.920]   please help us promote our magazine.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   And all it did was simply give me a blank tweet form
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.720]   that let me simply describe.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.120]   Okay, I'm using, I'm reading the Daily
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.000]   and I'm seeing a picture of a snow guy
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.600]   and there's a thing with a funny say.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.400]   As opposed to, let's say, a link with the actual image
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.960]   that I wanted to link to,
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.120]   which I thought was one of those things
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.600]   that you show it to the developer shows
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.400]   for the first time to the people that they're working for
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.720]   and the person says, you know what?
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.040]   I really think that should link or something.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.160]   But really it's more of a discussion on publishing
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.720]   on the iPad.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.760]   And Tanya, as one of the pioneers of digital publishing,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.800]   one of the first houses to simply say,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.680]   we are a digital publishing house
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.120]   with the Take Control series.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.960]   What do you, what's your attitude on the Daily?
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.600]   Do you think they, what do you think they're doing right?
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.880]   What do you think they're doing wrong?
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.560]   And what new features and new infrastructure
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.160]   do you think Apple has created
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.640]   that folks like you and other publishers
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.560]   will be able to take advantage of?
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.800]   - Well, what I think they're doing right
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   is trying to think about how a large news organization
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.600]   with a lot of resources behind it
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.920]   can move into the digital era
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.760]   'cause that's definitely what's happening,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.400]   especially on the iPad.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.520]   One thing that I noticed with my business
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.400]   was before the iPad came out,
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.160]   people were not so sure about reading ebooks.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.280]   They definitely were very polite
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.880]   and very hesitant about asking questions
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.280]   about if an e-book would work on an iPhone or Kindle
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.520]   or some kind of unusual device.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.560]   And they were very patient.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.920]   As soon as the iPad came out,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.400]   the attitude of customers changed pretty much overnight.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.480]   And then what they wanted was they wanted their ebooks
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.240]   on their iPad right now
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.080]   and they wanted it to work seamlessly and beautifully.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.280]   So I'm sure a lot of publishers,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.400]   regardless of whether it was ebooks, magazines,
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.560]   or newspapers, started hearing that.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.920]   And I think people expect their iPad
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.440]   to work like a sophisticated reader for all kinds of media.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.800]   So I think the Daily was right on target
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.200]   with targeting the iPad.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.560]   And I also think that they were on target
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.560]   with taking their status of their publisher
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.880]   and their money and going to Apple and saying,
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.400]   "Hey, we gotta work on this subscription model here
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   "because we are going to spend a vast amount of money
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.280]   "developing our app and setting up our content management system
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.680]   "and hiring employees, and we have to be able
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.520]   "to make a profit on it."
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.720]   And so I think it's great that they and other publishers
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.040]   have been able to have conversations with Apple.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.280]   Now I'm a vastly smaller publisher,
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.840]   so we don't have a huge amount of resources.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.960]   And my other reaction to the Daily
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.120]   is actually kind of a profound frustration
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.520]   because I feel as though they completely missed the mark.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   I think that most people who read news on the iPad
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.680]   are people who went down the rabbit hole, if you will,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.560]   of reading stuff online a long time ago.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.120]   And we expect our online media to be deeply intertwined
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.600]   with our social networking experience
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.320]   and to be deeply intertwined with other websites
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.360]   and media venues.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.040]   And so the Daily is just kind of seeing there
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.480]   on its own island on the iPad.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   And I think the photographs in the Daily are pretty gorgeous,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.880]   but the content itself doesn't really seem to be adding
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.520]   very much to the conversation that's happening online
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.160]   about all kinds of things.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.920]   It's not really unique or special content.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   And it's not so exceptionally wonderful of an application
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.280]   that I think people are going to stop reading
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.840]   the way they already do online to spend time with the Daily.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.520]   So for me, especially because I personally,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.480]   I'm a fountain of ideas about digital publishing.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.960]   We could do this, we could do that.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.240]   If we had a million dollars, what would we do with it?
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.320]   And I felt disappointed that they had so much money
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.360]   and the ear of Steve Jobs.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.600]   And it really just feels like they took kind of a newspaper,
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   a very traditional newspaper model
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.480]   and just kind of added a few e features.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.800]   And I don't think that they added anything,
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.440]   particularly even modern in the way of electronic features.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.160]   It just felt for all the money and people
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.200]   behind it very disappointing to me.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.800]   And I hope that they hear feedback like this
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.040]   and find out ways, find out how they can integrate
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.240]   what they're doing better with what everybody else is doing.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.120]   - That's an interesting part of this.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.040]   Jason, Mackerel has just launched their own digital edition,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.400]   a pretty ambitious digital edition.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   And Mackerel's digital edition and the Daily and the New York Times
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.960]   and a whole bunch of other publications
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.240]   have gotten me sort of wondering to what extent
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.840]   do we really need to reinvent how stories are told
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.240]   and how news and articles are presented?
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.040]   On the one hand, I do like it when I see articles
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.000]   presented in a dynamic way where you can see the relationships,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.400]   not only with this story, but with other stories
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.960]   that have been told a day a week, a month, a year ago
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.240]   in the past and connections to other sources of information.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.120]   On the other hand, it's okay.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.760]   One of the most important news reading apps that I have
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.160]   is simply InstaPaper, the ability to simply take any web page
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.400]   I have on my Mac that I'm reading
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.320]   and just simply put it in the buffer
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.040]   and just make essentially just a pretty much scrolling
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.240]   ebook version of it that I can then read on my iPad.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   What do you think about really the challenges
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.160]   of making a digital version of what has been a style
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.600]   of magazine that's been, has been changed
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.720]   since the days of the New Yorker in the '20s?
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.800]   - Well, I mean, there's a lot there.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.200]   Let me see.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.400]   One of the things is--
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.800]   - Answer any of those questions in any order you want.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.920]   - I'll answer them in a random order.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.480]   I will shuffle through them.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.080]   I mean, one of the things is about,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.600]   you talk about doing a magazine and a digital version.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.360]   A lot of the first magazines we saw come out for the iPad
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.480]   were essentially print versions of a magazine
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.440]   brought onto digital and maybe the page sizes were weird,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.720]   like Wired had a sort of tall page, you could scroll down.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.480]   But I never really thought that that made a lot of sense
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.800]   because it was like, what I always say is it's like
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.520]   the early days of TV when they would bring cameras
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.560]   into a theater and they'd shoot a stage play
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.880]   because it's the old medium getting stuck on the new medium.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.720]   And that's not really right.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.640]   You need to find the right thing to put on the new medium.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.240]   So, you know, Macworld's app, I mean,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.160]   we do have a digital replica that you can get
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.480]   through the Zinnio app that's the magazine,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.800]   except on your iPad.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.640]   But when we decided to develop our app,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.800]   and let me tell you, I wish I had a $30 million budget
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.160]   like the daily, we decided to go with something
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.800]   that's actually a little bit more like a newspaper.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.640]   So it's kind of funny.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.200]   Macworld, as a magazine, has an app that looks like a newspaper
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.120]   because it's fed from a lot of the same sources
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.240]   as our website.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.360]   Whereas the daily is a newspaper that looks more
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.200]   like a magazine.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.680]   You keep sort of calling it a magazine.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.040]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.680]   It's very magazine-y.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.880]   So, but, you know, one of the things is about
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   who your audience is.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.080]   And I think that has a lot to do with
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   when we look at the daily how we judge it.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.720]   What audience are they trying to reach?
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.600]   There isn't, you know, one distribution mechanism
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.640]   for everybody, right?
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   So from my perspective at Macworld,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.040]   some people are gonna read our website,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.720]   some people are gonna read our print magazine,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.440]   some people are gonna download our app
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.400]   and read it that way,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.920]   or they might just stumble onto links on Flipboard
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.960]   or save them with Instapaper.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.720]   And there isn't gonna be one single solution
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.560]   for all of this.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.720]   And when you think of it that way,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.880]   I think you look at the daily and say,
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.160]   what are they trying to do here?
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.600]   And it's interesting.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.080]   My conception of what they were gonna do with the daily
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.320]   was based on how I would build a newspaper for me.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.960]   And that's not what they built.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.880]   They built, like, if you look at the content of it,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.200]   it's very much like a USA Today style newspaper.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.800]   It's short stories.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.720]   There's not a lot of depth.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.520]   The photos are great.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.720]   It's much more like the New York Post or the USA Today.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.320]   And that's okay.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.280]   I guess what they're trying to do is reach an audience.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.240]   My guess is that it's an older audience.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.360]   It's people who are saying,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.280]   "Hey, if I get an iPad, can I get a newspaper?
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.040]   "Can I drop my newspaper subscription?"
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.600]   I don't think they are approaching the,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.280]   like, tech-saviest early adopters for the iPad.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.760]   I think they're looking for the people
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.680]   who are in that second wave who get an iPad
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.000]   and aren't very technical and want something
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.120]   that is like their newspaper.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.720]   And like I said, I think that maybe is an older audience too.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.640]   So a lot of us who are judging the daily
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.240]   may not be in their target audience.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.400]   I will say, to Tanya's point,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.680]   I think one of the great failings of the daily right now,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.280]   and they've got lots of opportunity to fix it,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.360]   is the inability to dig down for more.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.000]   Like, they have a news brief section in each of their sections.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And I think day two, one of the stories was
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.680]   that the NASA Kepler probe found, you know,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   thousands of exoplanet possibilities nearby in the galaxy.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.320]   And it was a 50-word blurb.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.840]   Well, why not put a link on that story
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.640]   and all the other little blurbs that you've got,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.160]   if you care enough to read more about it?
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.760]   But in the daily, it's a dead end.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.920]   There's a little tiny blurb,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.800]   and then they're assuming that all you want is that,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   because that's all the space they've got.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.640]   And those two ideas, the idea that we decide
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.040]   whether you want more or not,
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.480]   and we have run out of space,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.600]   are so old, old media ways of thinking.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.920]   And that's what shocked me about it.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.640]   I could throw in that they threw in a, you know,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.440]   a Sudoku puzzle and a crossword puzzle too.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.680]   You know, there are apps for that.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.600]   I'm not sure, the only reason you put those in there
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.320]   is because 20th century print newspapers
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.960]   had those kind of features.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.680]   So that's what shocked me is really--
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.200]   - We're missing the family circus, really.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.920]   If they want to be taken seriously as a new,
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.880]   do you need the family circus?
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.440]   - It's the old media thinking that shocked me,
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.520]   because the app has got,
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.000]   it's doing a lot of really interesting things
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.080]   and you can see that they spent a lot of money
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.920]   on developing it.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.680]   And yet some of the ideas behind it
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.040]   are obviously coming from people
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.360]   who are not thinking about reinventing a medium.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.040]   They're thinking about sort of duplicating
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.640]   the newspaper medium in on the iPad.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.360]   And it's disappointing, I mean, and the hyperlinking
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.200]   and sharing things socially,
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.680]   that's at the top of the list.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   I mean, why not?
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.600]   It could even be money to be made there
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.800]   if they added, you know,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.280]   I don't know, wire service versions of the long stories
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.480]   and posted them on their website.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.200]   And then they could sell ads on the website.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.400]   There are lots of ways they could do it,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.520]   but they chose not to and it's disappointing.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.880]   - Yeah, it's interesting you bring that up
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.160]   because it got me sort of thinking about the differences
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.360]   between the way I read news online
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.000]   versus the way I read news in the form of e-books.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.680]   I actually kind of like the idea of having a,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.360]   this pre-produced package of content containing stories
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.640]   that I wouldn't have found on my own,
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.360]   that I might, covering topics I might not necessarily
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.040]   have been interested in,
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.720]   if I were just wandering the web on my own.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.200]   So I like the idea of having delivered to my iPad,
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.960]   a big chunk of news, politics, sports,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.440]   all kinds of information as one container.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.160]   Chris, we haven't heard from you yet.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.200]   Have you tried the daily yet?
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   - I have tried the daily and like Jason and Tanya,
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.360]   I have my disappointments with it.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.480]   I think it's a reasonable first effort
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.720]   from a technological viewpoint.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.760]   It's slow, it's, I mean, the experience of using the thing
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.880]   is kind of a pain.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.600]   It takes a long time to launch and get the news
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.720]   on the application.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.880]   I'm not thrilled with the content, as Jason said.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.960]   It's very much USA Today and I think that's too bad.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.120]   I mean, it certainly fits in the news courts model,
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.080]   but I do think that there's a weird split there
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.640]   that the people most inclined to use this
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.200]   would be technically savvy because they have iPads.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.560]   And so I think you're looking at a more sophisticated audience
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.200]   than yet the content is really targeted,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.880]   not at a sophisticated audience,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.200]   but really people who want kind of cheesy headlines
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.480]   and very shallow stories.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.440]   They have the opportunity to bring this up,
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.920]   but I'm not sure that they want to do that.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.760]   I think they're looking out into the future
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.640]   and that this is really, they're hoping
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.800]   that the audience comes to them rather than trying
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.720]   to modify their content to fit a particular audience.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.440]   I think where this really is significant
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.080]   is the fact that somebody has brought some sanity
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.320]   to subscriptions and I think it needed a company like Fox,
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.440]   sorry, News Corp, to do that, to be able to go to Apple
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.160]   and say, we're big and we're big like you're big
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.240]   and we need to have offer subscriptions.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.880]   And that's somebody that Apple can listen to.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.080]   So I think it shows the way that news can be done.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.760]   And my hope is that now that we have sort of this model
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.040]   that Apple's willing to listen to
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.880]   and a subscription model we can listen to,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.440]   that other than publications will come into the market
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.480]   who can offer the kind of depth that I'd want from
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.680]   a news source rather than this shallow USA Today kind of thing.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.000]   - Yeah, as a publisher, I'm really excited
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.920]   about the whole approach to subscriptions.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.760]   And you're right, Chris, it did take somebody
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.880]   who's a heavyweight, I think, to negotiate that with Apple.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.200]   Although I think that was Apple's idea too,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.400]   is that if they could get it right
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.200]   with a high profile launch like the Daily,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.560]   that would help them fine tune it.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.720]   And since there aren't people inside Apple
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.080]   who are totally tuned into the publishing industry,
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.160]   they were able to work with News Corp
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.520]   who say what you will about Rupert Murdoch.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.000]   I think Rupert Murdoch's number one goal is to make money.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.400]   And I think that's Apple's number one goal too,
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.960]   'cause it's a publicly held company.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.480]   So I think they had that in common
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.840]   and they were able to work on how to get the business
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.880]   to make sense so that you could do these recurring charges,
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.280]   which is a, it's gonna be a new thing.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.160]   And I think a lot of people are gonna be excited.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.920]   As a comic book fan, I'm excited by the fact that,
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.440]   comic book buying won't have to be Alacart anymore.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.960]   I can actually put down a recurring monthly payment
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.200]   or even an annual payment.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.040]   And as a publisher from Acworld,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.640]   being able to say, we're gonna charge you now,
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.440]   and then a year from now, we're gonna charge you again,
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.920]   and then a year, or every month.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.800]   I know that the guy who's the chairman of our company, IDG,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.520]   every time he gets a chance, he says,
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.760]   what you really want is a monthly,
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.480]   you wanna monthly this and a monthly that,
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.840]   you want people to have a $2 charge every month
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.960]   instead of a big charge that they have to authorize
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.480]   every year because quite frankly,
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.120]   people are more likely to do that.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.920]   So it makes good business sense.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.240]   From a technical standpoint, Chris,
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.200]   I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about the app itself
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.160]   and the way they approach the multimedia stuff,
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.520]   'cause it is interesting that they've got lots of photos.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.040]   One of the things that I noticed is that
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.720]   they've got this weird kind of hybrid
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.360]   where sometimes when you're holding it in portrait mode
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.440]   and landscape mode, it does different things.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.520]   And then other times it does the same thing.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.440]   And I kinda got confused by that.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.840]   - Yeah, it's not consistent.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.240]   You're right, when you flip it one way,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.480]   it does one thing and does something else.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.400]   The other way, I think that they have
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.000]   such a wonderful opportunity here
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.520]   to do some really interesting things with media.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.760]   And as you say, they've kind of slapped
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.600]   this old newspaper technology onto this app.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.680]   They certainly have room to grow.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.080]   This is a V1 issue and it's only been out
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.920]   what a week now.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.800]   So I think they have places that they can go
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.480]   with a faster processor, they can do more.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.320]   And they're trying over the last week or so,
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.480]   you've seen them do a little bit better
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.000]   in being able to deliver something
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.080]   instead of waiting for a minute and 40 seconds
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.920]   for content to load.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.080]   They're doing a little better with the content.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.880]   They're trying to put in some editorial content
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.680]   that's more interesting.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.560]   So it's very early days.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.240]   There's lots more they can do with this,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.800]   but it would be nice to see a more consistent interface.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.120]   And I'm sure that's something they're probably working on.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.960]   - And I think the whole link thing,
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.080]   I mean, what's their strategy?
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.440]   'Cause the daily can have value with its own content
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.360]   and also highlight other content around the web
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.640]   because I know that a lot of traditional publishers
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.600]   would say, "Oh no, we can't do that.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.400]   "It needs to all be about us."
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.960]   But if the daily were the place I could go
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.640]   and know that I was not only getting the top news from them,
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.240]   but I was getting links to all the other interesting stuff
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.160]   that was out there, if I wanted to read more,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.600]   they sort of curated that,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.240]   that would make the daily more valuable to me.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.080]   So I don't see why it needs to be an either-or kind of approach.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.000]   Tanya, what do you think?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.680]   - I think you're right.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.920]   And I thought about what you had said too
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.240]   about how the daily is not targeting people like us
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.720]   who are very tech savvy
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.000]   and already read a lot of information on the internet
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.680]   that it might be targeting maybe an older person
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.480]   or someone who is not as comfortable reading on the internet.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.120]   They get an iPad and immediately wonder
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.560]   about reading their newspaper on the iPad.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.880]   And I'm not sure that I agree with that
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   just because most of the people I know who are older than me
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.760]   and who are uncomfortable with computers
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.880]   and who might get an iPad
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   because it would be kind of a simpler, lighter weight thing
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.800]   for them to use that they would enjoy.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   They really do already get their news off the web.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.760]   And I think that subjecting them to an app
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.720]   with its own interface quirks for how you navigate
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.800]   and how you get around that is really very unlike
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.120]   using a traditional newspaper or magazine
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.440]   is not gonna be so good.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.320]   And it would actually be better for those people
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.560]   to be using something that functions a lot like a website
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.200]   because they at least know the common conventions
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.600]   of using a website.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.920]   So I'm sort of concerned about the daily
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.520]   for kind of online digital newbies
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.600]   just because the interface is a little wacky.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.960]   And of course they can improve the interface and change it.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   But I think that I would be surprised
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.400]   if someone who wasn't already adept on a computer
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.600]   was given an iPad in the daily and sat down
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.160]   and told to read the magazine.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.520]   I think they would have problems.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.120]   They would not have an easy time.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.080]   - It's funny, the daily actually is sort of like the,
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.800]   it's not necessarily the newspaper of the 21st century.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.720]   It's more like the manifestation of the dream
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.120]   of the future newspaper from the perspective of like the 50s.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.080]   Like when the anchor pops up and says,
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.240]   I'm gonna tell you what's happening.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.280]   Press here to view.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.080]   I feel like I'm watching a fantasy of the news
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.240]   from the past brought into the present.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.120]   - The New York World's Fair version of,
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.840]   in the future, newspapers shall be,
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.040]   shall be assembled on a daily basis
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040]   with a speed of light.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.200]   Yes.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.320]   Well, I'm sorry for that little break.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.720]   It was sponsored by large company
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.920]   and maker of chat software.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   - My coup, my coup to take over as host of Mac Proquially
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   has failed Andy and survived.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.680]   My poison to take.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.600]   I was actually playing with my RC racer over there.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.960]   And I got too many tweets saying,
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.000]   "We'll come back, Jason's saying awful things about Canadians."
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.240]   And I wasn't listening.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.840]   So I don't even wanna know what you were saying,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.080]   but you know, those things are noted.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.880]   And the Canadians are armed, I should say.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.720]   - Well, it's a good time.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.880]   - They're lovely people, but they are armed.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.360]   So, okay, well, I guess this is a good time.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.560]   Has any two go to a commercial?
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.200]   Cause this is a good time for said chat software
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.160]   to screw up yet again.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.360]   So we'll be back after this message from Hover.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.200]   - Thanks Andy.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.720]   This episode is brought to you by Hover.com.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.320]   Now, Hover is all about making domain registration
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.240]   and service simple, simple.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.000]   Because I don't know, I've,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   so I've registered probably 80 URLs in the last 10 years.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.240]   So this is something that is near and dear to my heart.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.160]   And I've done it through, oh, I'm not gonna name them.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.000]   But they're all ugly.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   I mean, it's not, none of them near, none of it has been good.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:41.840]   You know what, then?
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.720]   So I'm really happy to be moving to Hover.com
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.000]   because it's just, I finally found one
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.280]   that there's not a gauntlet.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.720]   So, you know, like, in many of them
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.040]   that will remain nameless again,
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.280]   is that you sign up for your URL
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.400]   and then you can't find the continue.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.160]   Because it's like, and would you like to add this
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.600]   and would you like to have some flowers?
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.160]   And then we actually have some car detailing
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.000]   that you could have.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.640]   And there's, and do you want to rent a car
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.760]   in Sarasota, Florida?
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.960]   And so there's all this stuff that gets all built in
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.320]   and then somewhere down, really, really, really small
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.440]   is continue.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.400]   And you just want to go continue, continue, continue.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.240]   Well, you don't have to do any of that with Hover.com.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.040]   Hover gets rid of all of that stuff.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.440]   It doesn't sell you one service after another.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.680]   They just sell you, they just handle your registration.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.440]   They just handle your service.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.560]   You know, they have, they also have a no hold policy.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.160]   I don't know how many times you've had this issue
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.360]   where there's something wrong with your URL
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.480]   or you can't figure out why it's not working.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.440]   And you get on the call and now it's going to be
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.520]   the estimated time, wait, you know, wait time
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.200]   is going to be 15 minutes.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   You know, and then you put it on hold
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.280]   and then you're on an iPhone on AT&T
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.720]   and you lose the connection and you start over again.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.280]   So anyway, not that I'm, not that that's ever happened to me
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.600]   and not that I'm bitter about it.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.920]   So you won't have to worry about that with Hover.com.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.680]   They have from eight, nine a.m. to eight p.m. Eastern.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.560]   They have on Monday through Friday, they have a no hold policy.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.960]   So you're going to not be on hold.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.640]   You're going to get straight to someone who actually
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.480]   has blood coursing through them and they can,
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.120]   they're actually going to talk to you
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.160]   and they're going, you know, it's just awesome.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.400]   So definitely check it out.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.200]   Hover makes managing domains easy.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.120]   You can, you can hover the transfers are free.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.240]   So they don't charge an extra $10
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.600]   to extend the domain registration.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.880]   The who is privacy is free.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.000]   I don't want everyone who wanders by my URL
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.360]   to know, you know, what my address is
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.440]   and what my phone number is.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.360]   And that all gets, you know, privatized.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.960]   I pay, I pay used to pay for that extra.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.600]   Every single time I was like, yeah, I don't,
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.120]   I don't want anyone to know that.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.320]   And the Hover does that for free.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.760]   So if you need a new domain, definitely check it out.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.600]   Use the offer code MAC break and you're going to get 10% off,
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   which is awesome.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.000]   It's MACbreak.hovar.com.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.560]   That's MACbreak.hover.com to get it out.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:54.400]   And again, remember, they're only $15 now through February 12th.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   And if you use MAC break, you're going to get 10% off of that.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.760]   And so again, check it out, MACbreak.hover.com.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.560]   OK, Andy, take it away.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:09.200]   OK, sorry about that.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.520]   But it was silently again.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.880]   So I'm plugged in, replugged.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.840]   And that's when I got to enjoy the bouncing,
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.360]   the bouncing love of the spinning beach ball of death from Skype.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.480]   OK, OK.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:20.960]   Yes.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.320]   Yes.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.560]   For those of you who are watching live and wondered
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.080]   why I just wouldn't shut up.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.880]   It's because we lost Andy for a while.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.360]   We lost Tonya for a while.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.160]   And the host.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.360]   And I've got one more.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:31.960]   One more.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.080]   I was going to have to start.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.000]   All right, it's Skype.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.880]   All right, I said it.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.680]   It's Skype.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.040]   I'm going to have to start monologuing at some point here.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:44.560]   And just the Verizon ramble would just continue and continue.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.520]   It was like an advocate for--
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.600]   suddenly, there was only one host left.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.400]   And then we all picked a few who was knocking off on the sections,
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.160]   but was actually the producer of the song.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.360]   And then they'd be cut back to me, and there'd be an empty chair.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.560]   And the sound of crickets.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   OK, moving on.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.280]   OK, I need a beverage if you need to clear your throat.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.200]   If you need to do this, here you are.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.400]   There, now I'm clearing.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:17.280]   Hey, everybody's watching live.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.160]   I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.080]   And then I'll be back.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.080]   So I abdicate all responsibility back.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.720]   It's not your chair for heaven's sake.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.000]   You're leaving here.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.360]   See, the rest of us are professionals.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.960]   We're wearing astronaut diapers.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.400]   Well, let's get another sponsorship.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.200]   You know what?
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.760]   Sky comes in, sky comes down.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.920]   Sometimes Wi-Fi drops bandwidths, but you know what always works.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.160]   The crisp zero-cattle re-refreshing taste of dike Dr. Pepper.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.080]   I'm on the go and ready to show in no time.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.040]   Thank you, Dr. Pepper.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   So are we actually looking at a version of the Fox Chicken
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.560]   and Bag of Grain problem where--
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.400]   now remember that we can have Andy, who's the host,
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.000]   but sometimes Skype won't work.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.520]   We can have Tanya, who's a guest, and will always be smart.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.920]   But sometimes her connection will drop out.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.160]   We have Chris, who has the best backdrop,
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.320]   but he's not on Verizon yet.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.600]   So right now we're at the park where it's Chris, Tanya,
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.240]   and me in the boat.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.720]   We've left Jason on the shore.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.800]   So right now, he's--
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.640]   Oh, there you go.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.520]   There he is.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.720]   Always wash your hands, everybody.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.920]   Looking refreshed.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.640]   That's right.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.040]   Yes.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.200]   Thanks for sharing, Jason.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.160]   It's just us, right?
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   There's no internet watching us or anything, right?
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.560]   I hope you tipped the attendant.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.160]   $2 is customary for handing you that clean towel.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.640]   Yes, and there is a webcam in the Twitcottage bathroom,
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   right, I assume?
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.160]   Exactly.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.640]   It's so heavy.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.360]   Everywhere.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.480]   And for paid subscribers only.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:59.120]   After 11 PM, when CineMax lets you down, folks at Twit,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   are there to take care of you.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.160]   We call it the Diamond Club.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.000]   OK, OK.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.920]   Alex, there's a clean photo you, Andy.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.400]   So take it back.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.080]   You're fine, you're very much.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.960]   Next, there are a bunch of news on the Android front,
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:22.640]   given that it is the Bizarro iPad to our Truth Justice
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.800]   and the American Way iPad.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.960]   It is a subject of interest to most of us.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.880]   Google had an event last week in which they showed off
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.960]   the latest status of Honeycomb Android 3.0 OS.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.160]   That's the first version of the OS that is actually suited
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.000]   and targeted towards tablets.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.280]   Most of the demo wasn't about the user interface.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.280]   Most of it was just about ways of getting apps on it,
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.080]   services that were going to be available to developers
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.120]   as they're writing their apps for it.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.040]   We also had a sneak peek at Motorola Zoom tablet,
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.040]   which most people, including myself,
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.360]   is sort of marking as the big box, the big electronics
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.640]   manufacturer leader as terms of answers to the iPad.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.360]   It's certainly the hardware that is most similar to what
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.880]   the iPad is out to accomplish.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   Now, Engadget had a picture of a rumor
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.040]   based on a Best Buy house ad, claiming
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.000]   that the price of the Zoom was going to be $800, which
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.160]   was bad news number one, if that's true.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.000]   Bad news number two, being that although it does have Wi-Fi,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.920]   if you will not be able to turn on Wi-Fi
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.880]   unless you buy a 3G contract and then cancel it
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.200]   after a month, which means that you will also not only
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.120]   will you have to pay for the 3G service you don't want,
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.640]   but also a Verizon activation fee, thus adding about $50 or $60
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:50.920]   to the $800 price of their 32 gigabyte 3G tablet.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.000]   I'm not sure, how to react to this.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.200]   Obviously, you see I'm laughing, so that's
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.360]   my gut instinct is to laugh at this.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.160]   But actually, Honeycomb doesn't look all that bad.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.920]   It has one feature that I actually quite like.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.200]   It does carry over the widget concepts
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.440]   that you get on Android phones.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.280]   With the added attraction that the mail app, for instance,
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.000]   has a widget that you can put on the desktops.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.520]   You can have your Twitter widget.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.440]   You can have a mail widget.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.000]   You can have an Angry Birds widget, a Farmville widget.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   And so when you flip on the tablet,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.640]   you can notice that, oh, there's something really interesting
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.160]   in the mail, you tap on the widget,
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.320]   and the widget automatically launches into the full screen
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.880]   version of the Honeycomb version of the app.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.640]   Now, the good news would be that this gives you
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.840]   a really cool way to multitask.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.320]   There's also really good app switching features on it.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   The bad news is that it seems as though they might be--
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.760]   in practice, maybe Google is missing the thread here
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.880]   that there should be a difference,
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.800]   underscore the word, difference, between a tablet operating
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.840]   system and a desktop operating system.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.760]   It really looks like all this is missing.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.800]   It is a mouse and a really expensive consultant service
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.920]   contract to turn into Windows 7.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:01.080]   Chris, you're the iOS person that I always
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.480]   look to for insight and sanity.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   Have you seen the Zoom?
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.560]   Have you seen the Honeycomb?
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.080]   And what do you think about these things?
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.920]   If the answers to both of these things are no,
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.320]   make something up, because you look--
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   I would.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.120]   I'm happy to do that.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.720]   Yeah, I think Honeycomb is probably the worst
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.680]   cereal ever made by General Mills.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.920]   And I'm glad to see that it's being brought back
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.160]   to the new version 3.0 form.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.280]   Yeah, I don't get it.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.520]   Honestly, the price of this device--
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.400]   I understand that if you get the full-on expensive iPad,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.920]   you're getting close to that price.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.920]   You can easily spend over $700 on this thing.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.480]   I think trying to move into this market at that price point
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.240]   makes 0 cents.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.440]   Why only offer one model if indeed that's
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.560]   what they're going to do?
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   It makes much more sense to find at least
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.280]   the bargain basement model that's
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.480]   going to come close to the entry level for the iPad
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.640]   so that people can compare something directly
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.080]   rather than looking at this.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.160]   The price of the 3G makes no sense.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.240]   Honeycomb looks interesting, but honestly,
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.720]   I have to wonder how many people are going to care,
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.480]   because when I look at these comparisons,
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.040]   I look at the iPad it's been out for a year,
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   and I can't help but think about the iPod.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.640]   And come back when there was a new WYSI model
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.040]   and said, yes, this does more than the iPod,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.360]   and it costs maybe less or maybe the same.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.760]   And nobody cared.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.480]   It was because everybody wanted an iPod.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.320]   That's just what you wanted.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.360]   And I think that a lot of geeks look at these devices
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.880]   and say, well, yes, it has a better processor,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.960]   it has better capabilities.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.320]   It's more flexible in this way and more flexible in that way.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.960]   But ultimately, when it comes down to the target audience,
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.600]   which is not me or you, but just regular folks,
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.000]   they look at this thing and say, well,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.200]   but my friend has an iPad, so why wouldn't I have an iPad?
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.240]   And it looks really cool, and I've used their iPad.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.280]   Or I already have an iPad, so why switch brands?
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   And I just, and I don't know, maybe it's possible
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.360]   that this will be a different story this time,
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.920]   and it won't be a repeat of the iPod.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:01.360]   But I do think that Apple has done it so right with the iPad.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:06.440]   And as they do with the iPod too, it was so right
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.880]   that people had to come out and try to find some device
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.480]   that would differentiate it in some way,
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.880]   and it came out as either not as good
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.600]   or an imitation that didn't compel them to move
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.000]   for any particular reason, and is the reason flash.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.560]   And I don't think so.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.120]   - Yeah, it's weird that the best feature of the iPad
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.400]   seems to, despite all the great things about iOS,
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.560]   is 4.99 and no contract commitments of any kind after that.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.680]   So if you can't have an answer to that,
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.960]   you really have to come up with a really compelling reason
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.080]   why not, and I don't know if an SD card slot
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.880]   is really the answer to that.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.960]   - Yeah, the other interesting thing from,
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.560]   we're all sports jocks, sports nuts, sports fans,
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.240]   sports tyros, or Finacy League, Shinti,
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   Scottish Shinti League, it's just a lot of fun.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.600]   - It's so much fun, he's been changing hands.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.000]   But I think most of us are definitely in,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.560]   we're not just in the,
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.880]   we're not just past the,
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.640]   watch the Super Bowl just for the ads portion.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.560]   We're in the wait till tomorrow morning
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.520]   and watch the ads when they're posted online,
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.360]   sports portion, Motorola did go for a Super Bowl ad
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.640]   with the Zoom that was clearly,
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.800]   a clearly influenced by the 1984 ad,
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.440]   only instead of the sackcloth and dusty
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:27.120]   minions shuffling through the dystopian future,
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.600]   we had basically iPod,
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.480]   what other people would call debags,
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.840]   we haven't loaded up here.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.680]   And we have people in hoodies,
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.280]   actually very clean sanitary,
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.240]   they're very nicely put together.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.080]   - There's that subtle jab there, the 1984.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.920]   - Yeah, and they're all wearing iPod earbuds
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.320]   and we have a guy who, for all of his think different,
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.400]   he's still wearing a very boring gray suit,
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.320]   I don't know if that's a good touch there.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.360]   I'm just not sure what, and again,
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.040]   they don't seem unhappy.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.960]   They're just simply saying that,
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.880]   the message of this seems to be
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.920]   be different just for the case of being different.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.840]   We're not gonna tell you that there's anything new
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.320]   or different about this.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.160]   - I'm just wondering how much they paid David Pogue
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.080]   to be in this commercial.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.760]   - How many people are gonna watch this ad
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.680]   and think it's for the iPad?
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.600]   That's what I mean, that was my joke on Twitter
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.800]   that half the people didn't get,
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.480]   which is people are gonna watch this ad and go,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.960]   ooh, that's a cool iPad.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.120]   - Yeah, see, the one thing for me,
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.160]   look at the scene right here where he sends
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.200]   the electronic bouquet to the other person
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.800]   and the lovely looking lady and the other cubicle,
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.400]   but she also seems to have a Zoom,
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.520]   'cause that's the device she gets this message on.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.600]   So they're saying that only dudes can appreciate
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.240]   the awesomeness of the Zoom, is that it?
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.440]   - Yeah, the number of things that's wrong with this ad
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.120]   is kind of mind-blowing.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.200]   It's so wrong on so many different levels.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.600]   - Well, we have to look for the positives.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.720]   It is well-exposed, most of the shots are in focus.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.600]   - Nice color audio is good, exactly.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.400]   So I'm sure that the TV safe area,
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.240]   everything was supposed to be visible
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.480]   to both SD and HDTV work well.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.520]   So it's not like we're just throwing shade on them.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.560]   It's just, we're confused, that's it.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.920]   - You know, rule one of a commercial, I think,
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.040]   is don't insult, I mean, there's only one tablet right now,
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.040]   15 million iPads out there.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.120]   And what this ad does first and foremost is say,
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.040]   hey, everybody who bought an iPad is a drone.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.720]   It's like, don't you wanna try to reach those people
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   and sell your product to them?
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   Sorry, Tanya.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.840]   - Tanya. - Oh, that's right.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.720]   But I'm gonna take a contrary and point of view,
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.040]   just so we can have a contrary and point of view.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.560]   - I'm sorry, we're getting some siloing on your channel there.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.320]   I wonder if you could put Skype and restart
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.560]   in a minute so you can move on to another topic?
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.920]   - No, no, I'm gonna have a contrary and point of view.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.320]   - Sorry.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.680]   - So my contrary and point of view is just that
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.240]   there's things we love about the iPad and Apple,
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.480]   and there's things that I think arguably,
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.360]   some people don't love about the iPad and Apple.
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.320]   And Apple needs Android, it needs the Zoom
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.040]   or other devices to be good enough
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.160]   that they keep Apple on their toes
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.760]   and also that they give people choices
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.560]   who for whatever reason, philosophical, flexible,
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.080]   whatever their problem, if they don't wanna use Apple products,
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.480]   it's great if they have a reasonable alternative.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.360]   And we all want Apple to have competition
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.200]   so that Apple is pushed to respond to the kinds
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.520]   of things that consumers want them to do.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.120]   - Absolutely. - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.080]   - And continue to make great hardware.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.200]   And so I thought that the ad itself was quite on
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.000]   and it's quite funny that Apple is now being laughed at
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.240]   in an ad for creating drone-like people
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.360]   and some other device is claiming to be
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.480]   for romantic, artistic, creative people.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.800]   That's really quite silly.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.880]   But my other sort of main criticism or critique of the ad
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.920]   which just goes with a gripe I've got generally
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.400]   about the world is they never said how to pronounce the saying.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.720]   X-O-O-M.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.920]   - Exhume, like exhume the body.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.040]   - Yeah, so, you know. - Dr. Quincy
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.880]   and the cast of CSI are big fans of the Motorola Exhume.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.680]   - Yeah, and I think that Apple with their lock on the app store
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.480]   and the way they're progressing with the Mac app store
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.320]   and with their very single-minded sort of take on
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.200]   what people should be doing with computing these days
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.600]   that it's just really vital for them to have
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.200]   robust competition and glad that Google's trying to do this
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.760]   even if their first couple attempts are maybe more expensive
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.720]   or more weird than would be ideal.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.960]   They need to learn how to do this
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.400]   so they can compete with Apple.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.240]   - I agree.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.280]   I just wish that some of those points had been made in the ad.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.120]   Amazon had a really good ad for the Kindle
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.480]   in which all they had to do was say,
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.840]   here is the woman lounging in the bright sun by poolside
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.400]   reading a book on her $139 Kindle.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.280]   There is the guy sitting next to her on his iPad
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.600]   in which all he sees is his own reflection and it costs $500.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.000]   Those are the two killer points they made.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.200]   Also, they made the subtle point that
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.800]   there is a beautiful woman next to you
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.760]   and you wanna talk to her about her ebook reader?
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.000]   Really, sir?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.800]   Is that that man don't got game
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.440]   if that's the terminology that's appropriate for that venue.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.240]   So we do need a competition.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.960]   I'm more looking for the competition
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.040]   from companies like Notion Inc,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.760]   who seems to have built like the anti-IPAD tablet
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   where the iPad costs $750 and it's most expensive
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.320]   configuration, the Atom costs $200 less.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.560]   It's readable in bright light.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.640]   It's got more ports than any sane person
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.960]   or even one sensible Android developer would know
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.800]   what to do with.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.960]   I don't know how well it's gonna work,
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.840]   but it really seems like they're coming at it
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.600]   the right way.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.160]   - What kind of crazy mixed up world do we live in
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.720]   where Apple is the company that's got the product
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.560]   that is the price leader?
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   And that everybody else is desperately trying to get
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.440]   their product to be priced down competitive with Apple.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.400]   So I guess it says something about Apple
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.840]   buying up so much flash memory
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.920]   and now they're buying up a lot of display technology
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.840]   that Apple, the rumor has it that when the iPad was
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.880]   in development, the number one feature was $4.99.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.600]   That was the number one thing to target.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.320]   And even now, the Zoom looks great
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.360]   and I totally agree that we need good competition
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.400]   and gingerbread looks, interest are honeycomb, sorry.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.920]   It's candy, it's Google, whatever, honeycomb looks good.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.520]   But man, if the iPad's got a year lead
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.240]   and these promising competitors can't get close to it
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.200]   on price, how crazy is that that Apple is that far ahead?
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.400]   It baffles even me that we'd live in a world
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.400]   where Apple would be like 30%, 40%, 50% better on price
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.760]   than its competition, it's crazy.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.600]   - Well, I had sort of a scary amount of insight
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.960]   the other day when I was watching TV on my Verizon Fios DVR
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.400]   and I used to have a Tivo
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.120]   and I liked my Tivo and I could give you a long list
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.720]   of why it was technically superior,
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.720]   easier to use, more features, more sensible
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.280]   than any cable company provided DVR.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.080]   And then I moved and it became, it was a technical problem
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.840]   getting it to work properly on my new cable provider.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.840]   I said, okay, I'll use the Verizon DVR just as a stopgap.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.640]   And you know what, it wasn't great, but it was okay.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.280]   And since I'm not an enthusiast about DVRs,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.640]   it served the purpose.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.840]   And, and here's the big point that really came to me
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.800]   the other day, it gave me enough time with it
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.640]   that it, I stuck with it long enough for the technology
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.480]   to sort of keep up because now I've got an iPad app
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.640]   that lets me control everything on the DVR,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.360]   including the deleting and rescheduling stuff.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.400]   I like the fact that I can get, I can get data from it
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.600]   from any room in the house or in place on the internet.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.280]   I'm worried that this is the sort of thing that,
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.080]   I'm interested, I'm interested to see if this sort of thing
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.520]   happens with, with iOS devices too.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.520]   If people just get those cheap Android phones long enough
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   for Android 4.0 to be, to get so good at,
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.880]   for Android 4, Android to get so good at doing what
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.200]   the iOS does that, and maybe six, one half dozen the other,
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.960]   Apple could be in real trouble if they don't try to keep up.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   Chris, I mean, you've been following iOS stuff,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.120]   like, do you see any of this happening?
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.280]   - Well, it's Apple getting bored, I guess.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.560]   If I wanted to put it to one question,
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.360]   is Apple getting bored with iOS, are they stopped,
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.400]   are they seizing the challenge itself?
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   - No, I think they continue to challenge themselves.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.200]   I think that they will do that from within.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.240]   I don't know that they need a lot of competition from outside.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.280]   I think they're the kind of company that wants to do better
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.520]   every single time they don't want to rest on their course.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.680]   - Chris, are you, are you like on a construction site
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.040]   or something?
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.640]   - Yeah, you know, somehow, whenever I'm on that break,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.480]   it's when they have the leaf floor guy here.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.120]   Some leaf floor guy's out here.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.360]   - He comes every Tuesday, obviously.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.440]   - No, I think what he tunes in on this,
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.200]   on the live stream, he says, "Oh good."
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.400]   And he dashes over here and he turns his leaf blower
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.880]   on outside my office.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.000]   So yeah, I guess he disagrees with what we're saying
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.440]   and he doesn't have the ability to cut in our phone call
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.040]   and disconnect our internet connection.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.520]   - If he could be inside here, he would be the guy going,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520]   "Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.760]   "but instead he's got a leaf blower."
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.640]   So he works with the tools he has.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.080]   Yeah, he does fabulous work, by the way.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.320]   If you're in this area, it should hire him.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.680]   He's great, except for this.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.200]   I was talking about something.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.680]   Oh yeah, this apple, yes, everybody needs some competition.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.800]   But again, apple is going to push itself.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.880]   They've got this huge leap on everybody else.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.080]   And I think that they're not content to just sit
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.640]   and wait to see what happens.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.880]   Plus, again, as I've mentioned many times,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   they have a big whiteboard somewhere,
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.040]   locked away 17 layers down underground,
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.120]   where they've got this all planned out for years
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.280]   and years and years to come.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.640]   So I think that they look at what the competition is doing
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   and they look at their watch and say,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.600]   "Yeah, they're 18 months behind.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.880]   "That's six months from now.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.400]   "We'll be three years ahead.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.960]   "We're doing fine.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.800]   "Keep working."
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.560]   And we get the next thing.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.640]   - Well, we're gonna get ready to go
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.560]   to our picks of the week.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.640]   But before then, I want to do a lightning round of topics.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.520]   These are a list, sort of list of things
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.960]   that I've sort of bookmarked here
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.400]   that are interesting enough for us
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.600]   to have quick comments on,
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.280]   maybe not long enough for us to.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.240]   Well, actually, I was gonna say,
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.920]   not involved enough for us to talk about
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.840]   for 15 or 20 minutes,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.240]   but given cutouts and technical problems,
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.120]   who knows, we are still using our unidentified
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.800]   co-conspirator space.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.760]   I'm fixing them with the Steely glaze.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.280]   I'm hoping they're feeling very, very guilty
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.480]   about what they've done right now.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.960]   - First of all, let's start with practical stuff.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.280]   We haven't really talked about Mac stuff
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.320]   in Mac break weekly yet today.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.920]   So Mac books, it looks like they're definitely
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.440]   overdue for a refresh.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.960]   They usually are, we've usually would have seen
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.520]   a refresh in this about two or three months ago.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.400]   And now it's Burunde 300 and something,
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.800]   and we haven't seen a new one.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.360]   Is this a good time to wait?
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.160]   If you need to get a MacBook soon,
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.080]   should you hold off?
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.640]   And what are we expecting for the coming year?
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.000]   Let's start off with Jason.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.400]   - Well, yeah, you gotta wait.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.160]   I think that the rumors are probably true
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   that there's something coming,
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.760]   although this whole Intel thing,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   where they have the bad chip
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.280]   and the sandy bridge chip set
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.160]   that may actually be part of the next Mac books
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.920]   might mean that Apple's plans have to be delayed too.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.760]   As for this year,
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.680]   I think the big thing is gonna be
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.880]   more MacBook Air-like features in the other Mac line.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.160]   I wouldn't be surprised if we saw essentially a 15-inch air.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.000]   I wouldn't surprise me
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.560]   if the 13-inch Pro disappeared,
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.400]   maybe even the 999 MacBook.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.920]   But I think we're gonna see that approach
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.720]   of no optical drive and flash storage
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.320]   and just super light and thin
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.400]   pushing into the rest of Apple's line.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.960]   I don't think it's gonna totally eradicate it
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.800]   yet,
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.840]   but I think Apple's gonna start pushing them
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.600]   that way this year.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.440]   Tonya.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.320]   - I agree with Jason.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.600]   I think if you really want a MacBook right now,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.440]   you should wait.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.960]   In fact, I think if you want pretty much any Mac laptop,
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.120]   you probably should wait
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.160]   unless you really, really want one right now.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.240]   And of course, if you really want one right now,
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.040]   you have to look at the MacBook Airs
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.920]   because they're just pretty awesome,
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.960]   pretty reasonable price point.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.120]   And it might be that if you thought about why you want a laptop
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.840]   really carefully, maybe if you sort of modernized
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.440]   your thinking the MacBook Air would be
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.760]   just what you want anyway.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.200]   Maybe not,
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.560]   but it seems like there's just so much speculation
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.880]   and possibilities with what the monitor sizes could be,
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.800]   what the processor could be,
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.600]   what the hard drives, whether it will have a DVD drive,
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.320]   it seems like a very excellent time to wait six weeks
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.240]   and see if there's more information to work from.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.920]   That's definitely,
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.240]   and traditionally you always say,
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   well, just buy the Mac if you want it right now.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.360]   If you know you want it right now,
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.280]   just buy it otherwise, wait.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.120]   But it even feels like if you know you want it right now
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.640]   unless you want one of the new MacBook Airs,
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.760]   maybe you should wait.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.520]   - Chris.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.280]   - Yep.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.680]   - I agree too, it's wait time.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.480]   Somebody actually called me about this a week ago
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.360]   and said, I think we're at the Crossroads now
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.840]   where we're going to see more MacBook Air like things
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.880]   brought to the standard MacBooks.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.200]   I carried around a 15 inch MacBook Pro last week
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.680]   and I envied all my friends
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.080]   who were carrying around their MacBook Airs
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.200]   because my shoulder really hurt.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.880]   So yeah, it's time.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.400]   It's coming up, but this friend said,
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.400]   I really need it now.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.240]   I have to have it.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.440]   I need to get my work done.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.280]   - Fine.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.120]   - Well, do it, do it, do it.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:38.960]   You want it?
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.160]   And they looked at the air and they found that it wasn't big enough
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.560]   because they do a lot of spreadsheet stuff.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.480]   So it wasn't a big enough monitor for them.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.440]   - I don't think the airs are going to get any big changes soon.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.520]   It just came out with fall.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.600]   I think if you're looking for a MacBook Pro,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.440]   you should wait.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.760]   I think if you're looking for MacBook Air,
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.280]   quite frankly, I love mine.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.120]   I think you should just run out
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.040]   and get an 11 inch MacBook Air right now.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.880]   Just right this moment.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.720]   Go now.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.000]   Okay, wait till the show is over and then go.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.040]   - Now we use my Malafan group, Greek voice.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.120]   Correct.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.160]   You should wait before buying a MacBook.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.000]   Issue number two.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.960]   Will Apple start to phase out box software
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.880]   in their retail stores?
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.960]   There was a bit on MacRumors.com
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.640]   that sort of made the case for this very well,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.800]   but it's kind of a natural evolution, you might think,
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.320]   because Apple's having such a successful moving thing,
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.080]   people onto the App Store.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.760]   As sort of box to box software,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.680]   it seems like they would want to take that retail space back
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.320]   from the Apple stores and put them into things
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.600]   to actually make them more than $1.50 per package.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.960]   Once again, let's start off with you, Jason Snell.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.000]   - Yeah, the existence of the Mac App Store means that,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.880]   you know, Apple's got the whole Apple retail store thing
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.200]   wired down to every dollar for every square foot
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.280]   of shelf space that they've got in those stores.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.880]   And they've got to think that most of that stuff
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.640]   is going to be available on the Mac App Store
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.920]   and they're not going to worry about it.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.640]   I think there will still be some box software there,
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.000]   things that aren't available.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.640]   Like some of the security software
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.200]   can't be in the Mac App Store.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.240]   Microsoft Office isn't in the Mac App Store.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.960]   So I think some of it will remain,
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.560]   but it's going to keep on shrinking
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.200]   and wouldn't surprise me if at some point it vanishes.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.360]   Sort of like books and magazines,
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.040]   they've all sort of faded away from the Apple retail as well
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.200]   because Apple, you know, they make a lot of money.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.280]   They know very well what the best way is
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.360]   to make money in those stores.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.960]   And if the box software isn't,
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.000]   I think right now it isn't a big money maker,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.160]   it's sort of there to induce people into coming back
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.280]   and with the Mac App Store, it's not going to be necessary.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.600]   - Tonya.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.520]   - I agree.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.160]   And I think Apple will be moving to get rid of the software
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.000]   as Jason said, but not just to improve their bottom line
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.240]   in the Apple stores, but because frankly,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.280]   for the typical consumer, the experience of getting your software
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.120]   from the Mac App Store is pretty good.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.880]   And the experience of the updating is just so much better
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.960]   than the Hodgepodge of updating we've got now
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.760]   with each application having its own updater
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.920]   and its own technique for informing you about updates.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.720]   And I think it's going to really streamline
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.640]   the whole experience for a lot of people.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   So Apple, you know, they give them the way they really think
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   about the whole thing.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.680]   I don't think they want people buying software
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.720]   in boxes anymore just so that they're sort of dictating
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.480]   or curating the experience for their customers and saying,
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.080]   no, you'll like it better if you get it from the Mac App Store.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.720]   - Chris, Chris.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.120]   In the short term, I think they're going to get rid
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.120]   of third party software.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.720]   I think they'll keep their own software on the shelves.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.400]   I might note that when you now purchase a MacBook Pro
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.760]   and choose the add on option,
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.000]   you can purchase Aputure for $199.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.040]   I expect if you go into an Apple retail store,
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.680]   you look on the shelf and look at a copy of Aputure,
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.240]   it is $199.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.080]   If you go to the Mac App Store, what, it's 80 bucks now?
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.880]   So, you know, there's this opportunity
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.720]   when you have a new Mac user in there and saying,
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.600]   oh, by the way, if you're really serious about photography,
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.400]   you're going to want a copy of Aputure in this.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.720]   Say, well, of course I do.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.560]   And there's an extra $200 on your bill.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.400]   - I slightly disagree.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.480]   I think that there will always be some presence
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.200]   of box software chiefly because they have to make sure
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.480]   that when they get the people who are not that familiar
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.480]   with computers, who like the idea of actually getting
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.840]   a physical product when they're spending 40 or 50 or 60 dollars.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.720]   Although I agree with the consensus of the panel
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.640]   that this is a wonderful plan,
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.320]   a wonderful part in Apple's ongoing plan to trick consumers
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.200]   into giving the money and getting nothing in return.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.640]   Wonderful strategy.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.600]   That started with iTunes and said, yes, you own the software
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.080]   unless we decide to change the DRM,
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.120]   you want to switch something else.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.680]   And you own this one, there's a way that they can just give,
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.080]   consumers could just give Apple $200
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.520]   and instead of getting an iPod,
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.480]   they simply get permission to whenever they're at a bank
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.880]   or a grocery store, listen to whatever music happens
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.720]   to be playing.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.720]   I think this is sort of the natural evolution of that plan.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.080]   - Issue number three, the Catholic Church has approved.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:00.920]   This is true.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.760]   - Oh dear.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.240]   - An iPhone app that aids the penitent in the confessional.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.600]   According to the description, it walks the penitent,
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.080]   the person through the process of the,
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.320]   the off-gory of confession.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.760]   It has actually been approved by the clergy in the Midwest,
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.240]   a bishop and a priest walked into a bar
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.600]   and approved this app.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.120]   Features for version two are rumored to be the ability
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.120]   to tap into four square and see who's,
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.640]   if you're the king of sinning in your parish.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.120]   Also, you can see, tap a button and tweet your penance
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.640]   and also find out who is sinning within your region
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.960]   if you turned on location awareness.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.640]   Let's just get some reactions to this.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.480]   Once again, let's start with Jason.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.080]   - Must not say anything sacrilegious, must not say anything.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.920]   - Okay, and so.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.600]   - Must not say anything.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.000]   I hope the Pope has approved.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.480]   - The Pope actually, he did a very Steve Jobsy in response,
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.080]   saying that in general, he would like to see greater expansion
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.680]   into social media networks at the Catholic Church.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.760]   Does need to change with the times,
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.640]   obviously Vatican II in 1963.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.840]   We're ready for a third sequel.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.680]   I think it looks like it's more like, you know,
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.120]   the Godfather where they had Godfather II
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.640]   and then about a 20 year layoff
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.360]   and then Godfather III, the Vatican II Council was
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.480]   in the 60s were probably due for 3.0.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.640]   A lot of people probably itching
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.240]   to get those new features.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.600]   Tonya.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.560]   - I have a question for the Pope.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.400]   (laughs)
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.240]   My question is this.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.920]   - I can speak for his home, let's go ahead.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.240]   - My question is if I'm a good Catholic
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.720]   and I use my iPhone to do my confessions
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.760]   and I go to heaven, will I get to take my iPhone with me?
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.720]   Yes, but you may need to repurchase
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.160]   and redownload all of your content.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.280]   - Yeah, I could see that.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.200]   - There's no CDMA coverage in heaven, by the way.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.040]   It's only GSM, yeah.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.280]   - It's just as the level of things as it is on Earth,
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.600]   so it is in heaven, unfortunately.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:03.440]   - Chris.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.200]   - I think this is a rich opportunity,
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.680]   third party opportunity for the Catholic Church.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.840]   - A true joke, excellent.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.960]   - For in-app purchases.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.040]   - Indulgences.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.920]   - Exactly, indulgences.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.120]   So, you know, for just, depending on your,
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.560]   you'll have a menu of sins and, you know,
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.280]   priced accordingly and say, well, let's see, I lied
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.320]   and that's like a 99 cents in and you know,
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.040]   like, oh God, I'm forgiven for that.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.600]   And let's say, oh, this is really a big one.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.640]   You know, and that's a $49 in and so, you know,
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.800]   or the $69 in is the really bad one.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.240]   And so you did tap the button and you're forgiven.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.040]   And I think that is a wonderful way plus it.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.280]   It helps out the Catholic Church.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.320]   - Now, do you think that that will help to undervalue sins?
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.200]   'Cause a lot of people are doing the sort of sins
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.280]   that they feel are worth $50, $100, $200.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:50.120]   They feel that the constraints of an App Store model
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.480]   for indulgences means that they have no matter
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.720]   what it is, murder, coveting, a wife,
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.480]   slaughtering an ox on the wrong day of the week.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.400]   They're gonna have to price it out at $2.99
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.920]   and there's really no way to make a profit on that.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.600]   - So, so. - Well, it does drive sins
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.640]   down to the basement.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.200]   I mean, you've really got the kind of the lowest
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.840]   common denominator of sins.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.800]   So I think much like the Mac App Store,
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.920]   they have to keep the value of sinning
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.880]   at a reasonable price so that people aren't just
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.000]   sinning just for the heck of it,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.280]   just so that they can push the button on their iOS device.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.720]   - Well, my, my, my, my pronouncement on this is that
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.680]   I do think that's a good thing because if we put
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.600]   more iPhones in the confessional,
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.920]   there's an increased chance that your priest will be,
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.280]   and confessor will be playing Angry Birds
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.680]   will not really be paying attention
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.360]   and will let you off light in your, in your sentence there.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.800]   Okay, now, item number four, an iPad two
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.760]   has recently spotted at the media event for the Daily
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.920]   in that last week, leading to more substantive rumors
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.760]   or what is actually out there someone saw,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.040]   somebody with an iPad that had a camera on it.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.200]   So this is a good opportunity to sort of go among the panel
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.560]   here and find out what are you personally doing
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.240]   to screw with people's minds, to make them think
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.880]   that they're, that you have, you've been seated
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.680]   with new iPad and iPhone hardware,
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.600]   and that it does something that really absolutely
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.880]   positively will never do.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.800]   Once again, we're gonna start with Jason.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.040]   Well, actually it's really easy for me
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.800]   because I had that Verizon iPhone review
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.040]   that got posted a few days before anybody,
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.920]   any regular person had one because I got one from Apple,
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.720]   one of the few to get one, and at this point,
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.960]   that means that I'm a marked man.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.760]   Everybody assumes that that iPhone I've got that iPad
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.120]   I have in that case, you really just have to cover it up
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.960]   and they're like, oh, can I see in your case there
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.800]   to see what that camera on the iPad is?
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.000]   And then yeah, I suppose I could make like a little scrape
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.200]   or something and make it seem a little bit more,
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.720]   but I'm under suspicion as it is.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.440]   And of course, if I did have an iPad too,
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.000]   I couldn't tell you.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:43.840]   You see what I did there?
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.720]   - Good answer, that's what I usually do too.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.480]   Tanya, how are you screwing with people's minds
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.640]   about your knowledge of future Apple events?
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.320]   - Oh, I always just tell them, you know,
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.040]   that I know all kinds of things, but, you know,
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.560]   I would have to kill you if I told you, you know,
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.320]   how do you think I've been in this business
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.680]   for the last 20 years?
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.240]   But to more actively screw with our minds,
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.840]   I think I would use duct tape.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.200]   And I would take the oldest iPad in my house.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.000]   There's two and I would strategically put bits of duct tape
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.240]   on it to sort of cover up possible camera lenses and things.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.400]   Much to do it.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.000]   - Oh, cheap and effective.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.840]   I like that one.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.320]   Although you are missing a trick here,
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.280]   not only just to screw for screwing with people,
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.520]   but also to promote the take control series.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.840]   If you were to put on the, on the E Store,
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.360]   take control of new Apple iPad 3 Hoverboard
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.080]   and then simply remove it in about 10 hours
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.680]   and make sure that it was up there long enough
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.840]   to be in Google's cache.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.640]   You could really get a lot of people
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.040]   not buying the iPad to wait for the price
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.120]   to drive down to $299, buy them at a loss
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.920]   and then resell them at a grid profit.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.840]   Chris, I'll raise for the few minds.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:54.480]   - Yes, whenever I take a picture with my iPhone 4
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.640]   and I email it to somebody,
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.440]   I make sure that I change my signature
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.920]   to read sent from my iPad.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.680]   And that immediately gets people say,
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.760]   "Well, how did you do that?"
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.400]   - And then I have to apologize.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.720]   I'm sorry, I can't tell you.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.360]   - My usual manner is to tap,
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.200]   hold my hand up flat and tap into the air
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.960]   to commenting about how this new magical iPad
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.400]   is fair and goodly cut made of some such
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.000]   seemingly golden threads, such as only the finest of eyes
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.200]   can even detect it.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.000]   And it seemed to work a lot during Macworld.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.800]   I got a lot of people paying for my bar tabs
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.120]   with, once I let them hold it once or twice.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.280]   And they agreed that once again,
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.720]   the lines were pleasing,
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.600]   the interface was goodly cut
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.160]   and it would certainly be a wonderful addition.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.720]   Last item, there is a video we interview with Elton John
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.720]   and his husband and his new child,
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.000]   saying that he's looking forward to taking pictures
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.080]   of his new baby on his new iPad 2.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.240]   How do we all feel about this, Jason?
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.160]   - I'm gonna pass on that and instead point out
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.920]   that somebody in the chat room has just suggested
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.320]   that your priest will probably be playing angry God
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.560]   on his iPhone, not angry birds.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.840]   - Or pocket tensor for God's sake,
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.120]   that's why you're here to look at the chat room.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.000]   - And ask for Elton John to pass.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.640]   - Pass, Tonya.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.840]   - Well, either he's screwing with us
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   because he wants us to think he already has the iPad 2
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.880]   or I just think it's kinda nice
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.640]   he can take pictures of his baby.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.120]   - Excellent, Chris.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:24.640]   - Dearly as I love Elton and his music,
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.320]   I think he's old and confused
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.920]   and he doesn't know what an iPad is.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.920]   I think he's talking about his iPhone and,
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.000]   oh, this thing you mean it?
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.800]   - Yes, Elton, he has a lot of people around
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.560]   who say yes, Elton every day.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.600]   So I look forward to seeing the pictures he's taken
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.400]   with his iPhone 3G.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.480]   - Well, I actually think this is a great piece of news.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.640]   And also, despite what Gruber has said
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.200]   about not believing in a higher resolution iPad 2 display,
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.600]   I think this does demonstrate
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.040]   that we're gonna have a much higher resolution,
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.280]   perhaps even HD resolution display
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.720]   because as we know, it would be that much more difficult
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.520]   for Elton John to even see a standard iPad 2
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.440]   with those glasses, with all the pink tinting
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.280]   and the glitter and the feathers around it.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.440]   So a higher resolution display,
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.880]   I think is definitely indicated now.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.280]   I'm definitely 100% behind that rumor.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.200]   He did compose Rocket Man,
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.680]   and really that's all we know.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.360]   Am I involved in the space industry?
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.200]   No, I'm not.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.640]   Elton John is, I think that he wins.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.040]   That's the reason why we say he's no rocket scientist.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.120]   Okay, well, we're gonna go to our picks of the week,
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.200]   but not before this last message
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.680]   from our friends at GoToMeeting, take it away, Alex.
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.520]   Thanks, Andy.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.080]   MacBrake is brought to you by gotomeeting.com.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.120]   Now, I don't know how many meetings you're in.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.960]   I'm in a lot of meetings,
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.000]   and a lot of them are actually on GoToMeeting.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.800]   We actually do a ton of our training
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.840]   within the Pixel Core on GoToMeeting.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.400]   It is, we have people all over the world,
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.560]   and really the reality is,
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.120]   is that we have people all over the world
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.280]   that we work with these days.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.600]   We have friends, we have colleagues,
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.040]   we have clients that are everywhere,
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.520]   spread out all over the United States,
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.360]   all over the world.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.080]   I'm gonna be honest with you from here to San Francisco,
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.840]   which is something that I rarely like to do.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.400]   So, I don't wanna deal with the traffic,
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.400]   I don't wanna deal with the gas,
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.800]   I don't wanna deal with any of that stuff.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.680]   Parking, I just wanna talk to people.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.400]   But the problem is, is that over the phone,
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.200]   it's not quite enough.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.120]   You don't wanna, you can't communicate,
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.480]   you can't show what's on your screen,
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.480]   you can't have those pieces,
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.280]   and that's what GoToMeeting starts to bring
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.040]   brings all of that back together.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.200]   It allows everyone to see your screen.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.000]   You can have people take over your screen,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.040]   so you can show them stuff,
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.000]   they can show you things,
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.840]   you can have a conversation back and forth,
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.840]   all the things you were gonna do in a conference room,
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.200]   except you're not in a conference room,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.240]   you're in a really nice shirt and some boxer shorts,
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.280]   sitting at your desk.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.160]   You know, that, it's really quite nice.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.200]   Not that I've ever done that,
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.600]   for those of you in the Pixelcore
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.480]   who have been in meetings with me.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.320]   So, anyway, so you definitely wanna check it out.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.920]   If you're gonna be working with someone
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.720]   that is not in your office,
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.360]   not within like three blocks of you,
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.200]   GoToMeeting is the thing you need.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.080]   You can really keep those relationships close,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.520]   make sure that you're really communicating
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.600]   what needs to be communicated
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.960]   rather than what you thought you said over the phone.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.520]   GoToMeeting is great for collaborative sessions,
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.720]   product reviews and demos,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.400]   you wanna show people what you have,
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.880]   sales presentations, training sessions,
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   that's what we use it for in the Pixelcore primarily.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.080]   And just about any type of meeting
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.960]   where you need to actually see stuff,
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.240]   you need to bring a bunch of people together,
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.240]   you need to have that discussion.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.320]   The voiceover IP is all built in,
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.960]   so you don't need everyone on a phone
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.560]   and then looking at the screen,
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.480]   all of that stuff's built in, it's great.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.560]   You set up all of the invites, you send it out,
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.480]   and then they just get a little URL,
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.920]   they just click on it, pops open, takes over,
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.720]   and you're able to just have this meeting.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.040]   They don't have to be technologically savvy
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:42.840]   to really make this work,
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.480]   they just have to have a computer.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.240]   So, it's really, really, really easy to use.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.560]   GoToMeeting is brought to, of course, by Citrix,
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.280]   and it is the favorite because really it is
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.400]   the easiest to use and the most affordable.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.200]   So, if you don't believe me, you can just go ahead
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.480]   and try it yourself.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.080]   You can get 30 days for free,
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.880]   you can call your friends, call your colleagues,
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.840]   call whoever you wanna call.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.280]   Set up a couple of meetings
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.560]   and see if this really works for you.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.240]   It's free for 30 days, and it's a low flat rate,
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.960]   really low, if you wanna do it after that.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.040]   You can have as many meetings as you want
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.680]   for that flat rate.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.680]   Remember, the phone and IP is all built in,
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.760]   so you're not gonna pay extra for that.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.000]   So, make sure to go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.320]   and you'll be able to actually try it out, sign up,
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.280]   and see if this really works for you.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.000]   Okay, Andy, back to you.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.800]   And we're back with our picks of the weeks.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.520]   Things are on iOS, Mac OS, or just in general life
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.640]   that either we're fond of, we wanna recommend
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:42.800]   or just would like to write off against our taxes
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.920]   because we mentioned it on the show.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.120]   So, I'm gonna start with Jason.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.200]   Given that the two of you had just had sprung on you
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.600]   that you can tax deduct almost anything
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.440]   that you mentioned here.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.520]   If you wanna talk about the Chevy Volt, for instance,
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.520]   or 72 inch flat screen TV, by all means, go ahead.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.680]   But we're gonna start off with you, Jason Snell.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.320]   - That's the Alex Lindsey approach, isn't it?
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.080]   You mentioned things that cost $20,000
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.200]   and it's high end audio equipment
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.280]   and then look, magical things happen.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.960]   No, I try to go for more affordable picks.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.760]   So, actually, many people who know me
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.040]   know that I'm a baseball fan
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.320]   and that my childhood team, the San Francisco Giants,
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.760]   won the World Series this year.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.720]   This is relevant because I wanna relive
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.080]   during this cold winter when there's no baseball happening.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.000]   I wanna relive those moments of the playoffs
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.360]   and unfortunately, this boggles my mind,
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.480]   Major League Baseball hasn't made available
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.240]   the radio broadcasts of those games for download.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.000]   However, I am an MLB audio subscriber
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   and I used my two picks to record those broadcasts
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.440]   against the express written consent of the commissioner,
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.480]   by the way, and then edit them down.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.280]   So, my first tool was Audio Highjack Pro
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.280]   from Rogue Amoeba, which is $32.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.520]   And that allowed me to record the internet stream,
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.840]   the Flash Player-based stream of the games.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.760]   And that got me an MP3 file, basically.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.360]   And then, item number two is Fission,
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.800]   also from Rogue Amoeba, $32.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.200]   And even if you're not crazy like me,
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.400]   you might wanna use Fission for some things.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.920]   The idea with Fission is it's a lossless audio editor
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.960]   so you can take any MP3 or AAC file.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.240]   And normally, if you wanted to edit that down,
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.560]   like to cut out the commercials
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.920]   in the middle of a baseball game,
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.560]   you would need to open it up in an editor,
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.760]   which will expand it into full size.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.600]   And then you'd edit it
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.440]   and then if you wanted to save it back as an MP3,
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.720]   it would have to re-encode it.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.480]   And you actually lose quality
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.800]   when you re-encode something
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.080]   that had already been encoded.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.240]   It's like saving a JPEG from a full quality,
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.480]   like TIFF or a RAW file.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.000]   You save a JPEG and then you open it again
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:43.840]   and save it again.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.680]   It gets messier.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.040]   And in the case of audio files, they sound worse.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.320]   So by using Fission,
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.800]   I can take these MP3 files,
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.680]   trim out the commercials and save them back.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.320]   And there's no loss in quality
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.160]   'cause quite frankly,
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.560]   the quality isn't very good to begin with
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.920]   and I didn't want it to degrade any further.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.080]   And it worked.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.440]   So now, you know, I'm standing at the bus
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.920]   at Bus Stop at 7.30 in the morning in February,
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.040]   listening to a baseball game.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.200]   And the best part is when they say,
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.640]   "We'll be back right after this."
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.040]   It's immediately followed by, "And we're back."
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.600]   So rogue amoeba, and you can get that at rogue amoeba.com.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.920]   They're both $32.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.400]   And if you've ever been in that position
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.080]   of having to edit an MP3,
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.480]   not wanting to lose the quality, fissions the one.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.280]   - Yeah, I love audio hijack.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.520]   There's so many BBC radio documentaries
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.840]   that they're up there on the side for exactly one week
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.200]   and you can't download them.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.000]   And because I always send in my TV license fee
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.240]   here from the colonies
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.800]   because I listened to these programs,
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.640]   radio license fees as well.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.120]   Yeah, I feel as though I'm entitled
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.920]   to not only listen to them, but capture them
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.880]   and actually be able to actually listen to my car.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.640]   So yeah, audio hijack has been,
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.200]   if there's a pick of the week,
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.800]   I'll start audio hijack is definitely one of them.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.840]   Tania, what's your pick?
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:56.560]   - Well, my pick concerns email because I am email involved.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.560]   I spend a lot of time in my email
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:02.040]   and I'm also very email challenged.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.440]   I get more email than really I can deal with.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.200]   So first of all, I should mention that I use Gmail
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.000]   and I've installed on my Macintosh
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   sort of wrapper app for Gmail called Mailplane.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.640]   And what Mailplane does is it just brings your Gmail
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.640]   kind of in the usual Gmail interface,
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.080]   but with a couple kind of Mac-ish tweaks
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.920]   and it puts it in its own application.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.040]   So it's not running on a tab in your web browser window,
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.240]   which I like a lot.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.400]   But it also is still very much Gmail.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.160]   So you're not trying to like integrate the way Gmail thinks
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.160]   with the way the mail application works or something like that.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:46.440]   So anyway, I use Mailplane and Mailplane periodically updates
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.480]   and three or four days ago the update came down the pipe
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.840]   and it said, hey, if you update one of the new features
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:57.120]   is that you can install a plugin called ZeroBoxer.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.800]   And I thought, oh, okay, that sounds interesting.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.080]   And I'll check it out a little more
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.040]   and it turns out that ZeroBoxer,
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:08.040]   which by the way is my official plugged product,
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:11.320]   my pick of the week, is a little game
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:15.280]   that you play in email and you get points
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:19.040]   by deleting or archiving or sort of dealing
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.600]   with the stuff in your inbox.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.320]   And the more you deal with, the more points you get.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.720]   I mean, obviously there's a lot of ways
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.160]   to cheat the system here, but where it gets kind of fun
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.960]   is that you can play against friends.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   So I got my husband and co-conspirator here at Tibitz
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.280]   to also install this and we sort of, you know,
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.960]   friended each other.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.840]   And now we're competing over, you know,
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.920]   who clears the most messages and who writes the most messages
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:51.480]   and then at dinner we can compare our scores.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:56.480]   And you can friend anyone who's in your Google contacts
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:02.360]   but I kind of didn't want to just friend random people
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.280]   who happen to be in my Google address book.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.120]   So I need other people who know me to install this plugin
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.240]   and sort of, you know, announce the world
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.920]   that they want to play and then I can find them
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.920]   and we can see who is the true email ninja.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.800]   And that is my pick so far.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.920]   It's being fun and it is helping me to focus more
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.280]   on getting work done in mail instead of just, you know,
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:33.640]   reading random emails that aren't very work related.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.680]   Well, I came up with my own inbox zero solution.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.520]   It was going into preferences and mail and turning off
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.560]   that feature that puts the number of unread emails
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.400]   badged inside your doc icon.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.320]   So as I stopped seeing that five digit number,
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.440]   I thought, okay, I'm doing great.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:49.960]   Chris, your pick.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.040]   - Okay, first I want to add something to Jason's pick
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.600]   and that is that you can get fission
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:57.320]   and audio hijack pro together in a bundle for $50.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.840]   So you save 12 bucks by purchasing together.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.680]   - Thank you. - Thank you very much.
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.520]   - You're welcome.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.640]   This, my pick goes along with a story from
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.160]   like Mackerel Expo last week.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.480]   And that is that Ben Long and I were doing our iPad session
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.120]   and we're doing it in front of a live audience.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.360]   And they give us these devices called Elmo's
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.200]   and essentially these are cameras that are mounted
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:23.480]   on an arm that show what's ever placed on the thing below
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.360]   which might be your iPad.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.480]   The picture isn't all that great.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:29.280]   So I was hoping that I could find a way to actually project
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.880]   all of the interface from an iPad out to the audience
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.760]   and sure, and if you can, if you jailbreak your iPad
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.200]   and that's what I did, I used a tethered jailbreak
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.240]   called Red Snow to do that.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.840]   Well, just a couple of days ago, a new jailbreak has come out.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.840]   It's called green poison and that's green P-O-I-S-0
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.080]   and because you have to do that and it's free.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.960]   And you tether your thing to your Mac,
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.840]   you install green poison very much like you've installed
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.160]   other jail bricks in the past.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.120]   And when you do that, you end up with a little app here
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.800]   and I'll see if I can show it on my monitor
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.280]   without shiny too much.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.320]   Anyway, it's this green thing over here called loader.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.800]   And once you've got loader installed,
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.640]   then you can install SEDIA,
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.320]   which is an option within loader.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.840]   And once you've got SEDIA in there,
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.640]   then you can purchase an add-on that's called display out
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.200]   and it's $2.00, it's available from the Big Boss repository.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.360]   With that, you can attach a 30-pin to VGA adapter
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.040]   to the iPad, connected then to your projector
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.400]   or you can connect it to a monitor or your television
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.360]   if you like.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.400]   And it looks great.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.120]   It looks just like the iPad's interface.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.560]   It's like having Steve Jobs there with his secret iPad
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.640]   and iOS device where he can display the entire interface
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.200]   instead of just little apps that are allowed to do it.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.440]   It doesn't seem to affect battery performance.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.000]   It's very responsive.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   So unlike some of the other TV out packs they had in the past,
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.160]   this one actually when you flick on your iPad,
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.080]   you see it happen immediately on the screen.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.240]   It's quite clear.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.560]   It also supports composite and component video out,
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.920]   but it doesn't look nearly as good as VGA.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.320]   So if you're of a mind to jailbreak your iOS device
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.480]   and you need to display out and teachers
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.360]   and presenters often do, this is one way to go.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.400]   If you do that, your Apple warranty is completely shot.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.520]   So you're breaking the warranty, but it's not illegal.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.680]   This has been the librarian of Congress says
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:27.480]   it's perfectly okay to jailbreak and unlock devices.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:29.880]   But once you do that, your warranty is had it.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.760]   So green poison and the display out plug-in are my picks
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.920]   of the week.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.520]   - Now what do you have to do to do anything
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.760]   to resecure your iPad after you're done?
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.240]   So I know that one of the core components of every jailbreak
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:47.520]   has to be the ability to SSH remotely into the iPad.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.320]   And one of the, every time I've seen a jailbreak routine,
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.680]   it's always been, oh, and make sure you change
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.760]   the default password,
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.640]   'cause essentially you've just established open SSH
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.360]   is that all taken care of for you?
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.800]   - No, it's not taking care of for you.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.360]   But when you install SADIA, there is a link there
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:03.600]   that says how to change your iOS device password
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.720]   or runs you through it.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.800]   You can either do it from terminal on your Mac
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.760]   or you can actually install the terminal app
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.480]   which is a jailbreak app on the device itself
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.160]   and then change your password there.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.840]   And you absolutely should.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.320]   We haven't seen a lot of people jumping into jailbreak
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.120]   and iOS devices for a while, but at one time there was
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.200]   because nobody changed their password.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.400]   And now you can do that.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.840]   And on there it provides complete instructions
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.160]   as well as what the default password is for these devices.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.600]   - Awesome. And yeah, you say the frame rate is way up there.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:36.080]   The last time I do have a jailbroken iPad for that purpose,
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.040]   it works in like two or three frames per second.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.880]   So it really is just way up there.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.760]   - You're probably using the old one, which is TV out,
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.080]   which is very slow.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:45.880]   The display out is quite fast.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.280]   So yeah, I think if you still have that device,
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.800]   it's $2, you have to get it through the SADIA store,
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.880]   which requires that you provide them with either a PayPal account
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.200]   or your Amazon ID, then they can charge it to there.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.240]   It comes through on your credit card,
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.320]   just as any other Amazon purchase does.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.720]   Then you link it through either Facebook or Google.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.680]   So it's not as easy as using the App Store,
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.760]   but it's not as complicated as it sounds.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.320]   But yeah, absolutely try it with display out.
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.600]   I think you'll like it.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.040]   - Awesome. So when we were another,
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.120]   either you get a really great display out hack
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.040]   or you once again restore your faith
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.880]   and how good an idea is the Apple App Store.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.080]   - That's exactly.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.640]   Okay, well my pick is going to be of great appeal
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:29.520]   to people, to geeks of a certain age.
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.600]   It's called cathode and it is simply a terminal emulator app
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.080]   for the Mac OS.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.400]   And well, what do you need?
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.960]   Why do you want to buy a terminal emulator app
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.840]   for $20 terminal emulator app for?
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.880]   Because you already get a terminal app
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.920]   built into the OS.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.440]   Well, this one will give you such wonderful, warm, fuzzy,
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:50.160]   American graffiti style flashback memories
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.720]   of its 1983, it's 1984 and you're behind an Apple IIe
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.120]   and you're in the school library
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.840]   and you got there to class late
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.120]   and you're using like the crummy old monitor
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.560]   where like the refresh rate is a little bit off
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.600]   and so you get scan lines going in.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.520]   It really does everything it can possibly do
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.520]   to emulate a vintage really crummy, crummy old monitor.
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:15.600]   And it seems like one of those apps
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.200]   like okay, ha ha, that's funny, ha ha,
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.400]   then you delete it.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.920]   I was surprised at how completely this took me back.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:27.120]   I was immediately like thinking about 6502 assembly language
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.960]   and how I can like, you know, access track zero
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.680]   of this electronic arts game.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.080]   So I could like, I could unlock it
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.600]   and make copies for my friends.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.480]   I could hear the disc disc disc disc, this like going.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.560]   I could, it was very, very pleasant.
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:45.640]   It's, I also respect the fact that they really did this well.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:48.320]   There are a lot of, it's not that a new idea,
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.920]   this sort of like vintage terminal emulator,
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.160]   but usually it's like, oh look,
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.920]   it's green text on a black background.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.120]   Oh, and look, and it's a mono spaced old photo.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:56.960]   Ha ha ha.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.320]   It's no, the ever reproduces the distortion
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.920]   from the curvature of the screen.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.960]   And not only that, but you can adjust its settings
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:07.160]   so that it can be essentially a really good monitor
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:10.080]   new out of the box in 1983, 1984,
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.960]   or it could be a crummy old one where the,
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.760]   like you've got a composite connector in there
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.800]   and it keeps, there's like, it's a dirty connector.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.320]   So it keeps like sort of fritsing out just a little bit.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.400]   As a matter of fact, it has a great demo mode.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.680]   Before you, if you download the demo version from the site,
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.680]   which is at secret, secretgeometry.com,
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.440]   if you download the demo version,
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.120]   it continues to steadily degrade the quality
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.000]   of the terminal over the course of fiber.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.800]   You get five minutes of clean usage.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.680]   And then just after like 20 minutes,
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.400]   it's just completely unusable.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.720]   Just like the Apple II II II used to use in the library
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.680]   back in junior high school.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.800]   If you pay 20 bucks, you get to control all that,
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.480]   not only that, but decide if you want an amber display,
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.680]   a white display.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.320]   Like it's, it's really, it was really cool
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.000]   because like I'm saying, I wasn't prepared
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.640]   for the effect it would have on me.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.800]   It's just like, to a certain generation,
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.640]   the right tune from the '60s would take you right back
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.200]   to where you were the first time you heard this song.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.440]   This app took me right back to where I was
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.640]   when I was using markers like this.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.680]   So just solely for nostalgia purposes,
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.520]   that's my pick of the week.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.640]   It's called "Catheaud."
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.560]   And I believe it's available from the App Store,
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.240]   but you can also download it from secretgeometry.com.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.080]   That's gonna be our show for the week.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.360]   But first, let's go around the horn
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.480]   and thank my wonderful, wonderful guests.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.120]   This really was a guest starting with Jason Snell,
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.440]   vice president and man to be feared
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.520]   at the mighty Maxwell Publishing Empire.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.320]   - No, no, no, I'm very friendly,
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.680]   but thank you for having me.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:46.760]   - That's why you're so feared.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.680]   You get people into their confidence and then zzzzt.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.520]   - Yes.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.360]   - You see me, I said that was--
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.200]   - Stop giving away all my best material Andy, geez.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.480]   - Well, because I didn't want,
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.200]   I wanna stay on your good side and I figured
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.400]   that if I'm the first one to tell you
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.360]   that counter defenses against the zzzzt have been developed,
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.680]   maybe I will be spared in the coming publishing.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.320]   - Ah, yes, yes, that's good, good point.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.760]   And folks can see your wonderful work at MacWorld.com.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.440]   Tonya Anks is head of take control publishing.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.720]   And boy, your ebooks have kind of saved my bacon
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.640]   many, many times because I'm in the middle
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.840]   of writing something and like, wait a minute,
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.640]   is that exactly how this networking feature works
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.720]   or is this just how I think this networking feature works?
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:29.120]   And I will download a PDF and found it, oh,
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.880]   so I'm an idiot and thanks to take control,
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:35.760]   only your payment processing system and myself
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.200]   will ever need to know the level of my ignorance.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:43.240]   And so thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.480]   - Well, it's my pleasure and of course,
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.640]   the main reason for this series
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.480]   beyond all the other great reasons is
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.200]   I could never run my own Mac if I didn't edit most
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.360]   of the books so I could read how you do stuff.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.400]   It was a pleasure to take a break from the daily grind
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:04.880]   of getting people to write and edit books
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.880]   and just to hang out with you guys for a few hours.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:07.720]   - Excellent.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.240]   And you're at takecontrolbooks.com,
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.240]   you have a special deal in the offing
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.560]   just for Mac Break Weekly listeners, is that true?
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.680]   - This is true.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.240]   I just also have my, I have a little show
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.160]   and tell here, wait, ooh.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:25.400]   Yes, I just wanted to prove that even though, come on.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:28.440]   I'll be a little trouble with the camera here.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.800]   Even though they're electronic books, they do exist,
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.080]   you can read them on your iPad, your iPhone
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.920]   or your Mac or your Kindle and we've heard good things
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.680]   about the Nook and other ebook readers too.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.120]   We're offering Mac Break Weekly readers
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.320]   a 30% off discount on a trip through our shopping cart.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.720]   We have the take control ebook series there.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.120]   We also have Mac World's Super Guide series there.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:55.440]   And I assume that the folks at Mac Break Weekly
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.960]   have some magic way of making the coupon code available
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:03.080]   to everybody but we have made a custom coupon code
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:08.080]   that people can key in and you could also email me personally
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.800]   if you can't find that coupon code
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:15.800]   but saw this video broadcast.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.480]   Yes.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.760]   - And if you're watching this
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.920]   via the Miracles of Internet Television,
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:25.080]   you are right now seeing superimposed that exact code.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.280]   As a matter of fact, let's really make this difficult
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:29.120]   for the editors.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.880]   Uh oh, it's budget the value canaries flying in
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.440]   and delivering, oh, what's that?
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:37.280]   Oh, you're landing on my hand right now with the coupon.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:41.880]   Oh, well, if you just type in this coupon code at checkout,
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:45.160]   you will get 30% off the take control books of your choice.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.880]   Thank you, budgety, the budgety.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:49.700]   Oh, well, thank you very much,
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.280]   I was surprised to have you here.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.880]   All right, well, maybe.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:55.040]   Or maybe that was just something that I imagined.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.640]   This is as usual, the proportion of Jack to Coke
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.440]   tends to filter depending on how much responsibility
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.120]   I have over the course of these show.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.880]   So my apologies for that.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.520]   Chris, thank you very much.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.960]   Where is the best place for people to see your specific
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.800]   and exciting brand of elegance?
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.520]   - That would be under Jason Snell's thumb.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:22.800]   And you can find that at macworld.com.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.880]   - And it sounds like a song cue, Chris.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:27.720]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.800]   - Is that a song cue?
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.120]   Is that a song cue?
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.520]   - Yes, it is.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:32.360]   Do you have that?
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.200]   You can cue that.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.040]   - Yeah, I'm sure the editors have been wearing a mask suit.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.040]   So yes, thank you very much, Andy.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.840]   And of course, you can find me at macworld.com.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.960]   You can hear me every other week hosting the Macworld podcast.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.320]   And of course, check out Linda.com
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.880]   and Peach Pit for my video training and books, respectively.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:51.720]   - Awesome.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.680]   Well, my thanks, everybody.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:55.760]   Again, I saw all of you during Macworld Expo,
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.920]   but there's something about the detachment
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.720]   and the technology interposing between conversations
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.880]   that makes these things so much more real,
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.440]   or at least to a social introvert, such as me.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.920]   I am Andy Anako, tech columns in Chicago sometimes.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.800]   I've read my columns several times a month,
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.760]   usually four to six at sometimes.com,
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.480]   or you can check out my own site.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.360]   Go to cwob.com, my celestial waste of bandwidth
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.680]   for all the relative links.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.600]   Well, that's it for this week.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.880]   Until then, next week, that would be.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.480]   - Rick, time's over.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.640]   Get back to work, you gold bricks.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:30.640]   That boss screen isn't froling, everybody.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.920]   I know what happens when he hit Control Shift F8.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:35.800]   Come on, not pay any of that,
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:38.280]   listen to podcasts.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:42.560]   Those 1029s are gonna file themselves.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.280]   Do you not know what kind of academy this is?
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.600]   How quickly I can get anybody from ITT technicals to do
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.720]   what you do without benefits?
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:52.720]   - And see.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.960]   (laughing)
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.720]   - You see, you know what?
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.560]   It's not just that I want this part, director.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.400]   I need this part.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.720]   - Until then.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.960]   - And by then, I mean, next week.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.200]   - It was called an improv.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.360]   (laughing)
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.760]   - Not all of us go from a script.
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.080]   Not all of us have a staff who simply thrusts
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:15.120]   to teleprompters and index cards to say,
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:17.880]   "Hey, I know that you're the corporate talking head shill.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.560]   "So here's the stuff that the money men want you
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.720]   "to read on our behalf, Jason."
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.240]   - So were you refilling the Jack and Coke
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.680]   when you were off for a couple minutes?
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.520]   Was that what you're doing?
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.880]   - That's why Becca here for.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.760]   She's a freak.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.440]   - Chatroom saying, "Boy, the editors are gonna have
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.840]   "their work cut out for them in this episode."
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.680]   No, no, you think?
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.520]   - No, no.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.400]   - No, this is the point at which we can all get out
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:39.280]   our swearing.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   At least, at least, we're not as bad position as Chris,
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.120]   as the bugle.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.360]   At least we're not cussing.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.700]   (beeping)
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.240]   Bagels.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.600]   - Sweet zombie (beeping)
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:58.560]   - Well, if you really wanna see Blasphemy,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.720]   we've already talked a lot about the church.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.560]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:02.880]   - I think we--
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:03.720]   - Angry (beeping)
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:04.560]   - Angry (beeping)
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.400]   It's an old (beeping)
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.240]   game.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.080]   - We're definitely gilding the crucifix there.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.600]   There's no need to keep on doing that.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.640]   (beeping)
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.400]   - And if I don't find it in the next 20 seconds,
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.560]   then I'm just gonna say that it's (beeping)
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.400]   microphone right here.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.640]   - The editors will just release last week's podcast
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.480]   with a new (beeping)
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.320]   - It says the chat.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.120]   - It's not as though the editors go (beeping)
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:25.760]   that's called podcast laundering.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:27.760]   And they're the (beeping)
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.960]   bees, speaking of angry.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.320]   - It's not as though they don't like
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.160]   to take a little break themselves, you know?
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:34.280]   Get themselves a (beeping)
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.960]   freshen up.
