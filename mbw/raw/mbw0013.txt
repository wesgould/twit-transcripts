[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.240]   This is MacBrige Weekly, episode 13 for October 31, 2006.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   Geekfest.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:55.600]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.960]   This is Alex Lindsay, and I am taking-- I'm stepping into Leo's
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   very large shoes to host MacBrige Weekly this week.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.480]   And I'm here, joined with-- from Chris Breen.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.880]   Hey, Chris.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.040]   Hey, how are you?
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.920]   It's Playlist, right?
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.080]   It's PlaylistMag.com in Macworld, yeah.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.600]   All of those things.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.640]   All of those things.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.160]   And I have noticed how enormous Leo's shoes are,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.760]   because the band has feet like a flamingo.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.080]   Yeah, he's a very good swimmer.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.560]   That's what I've heard of here.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.080]   He's actually on a boat right now,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.920]   and I think he's actually using those large feet
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.080]   to swim around in the ocean.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.760]   Yeah, I mean, they're like size 17.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.440]   It's just a remarkable-- and you wouldn't know it,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.320]   looking at them on camera.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   But you'll notice they never pan down those feet.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.760]   Yeah, it's very-- he has them all custom-made.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.120]   Also, Scott Bourne from iLiveZone and about 14 other websites.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.040]   Can you list them all, Scott, quickly?
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.520]   I could, but the problem is is that I only have 42,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.320]   and Merlin has 43.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   And until I have 43, I refuse to list them all.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.360]   There you go.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.040]   Also, of course, Merlin Mann, Merlin43folders.com.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.480]   Hello, boys.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.000]   So--
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.000]   So we've got all kinds of news coming up this week
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.360]   in the Mac world.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   Now, the rumor is starting to pick up,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   because we're getting close to the Intel
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   being able to release--
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.480]   releasing these four core chips.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   Do we think that Apple is actually
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.440]   going to release a--
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.720]   I guess it would be an eight core Mac Pro,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.560]   which right now they have.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.080]   They have a four-prock.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.640]   It's a dual-dual core Mac Pro.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.200]   We've already seen there have been these guys that have already
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   put together.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.720]   They've tested some of these, where the operating system
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.080]   clearly sees eight cores.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.200]   Do we think that Apple's going to do something this fall?
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.840]   Are they going to wait until Mac Pro?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.200]   Chris, what do you think?
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   Do you think it's going to--
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.200]   I think they're going to wait.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.560]   And I think they're going to wait,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.400]   because if we look back at what they just
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.680]   did with the Mac Book Pro, where they put core 2-duals
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   in those things, it wasn't that long ago
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.760]   that they came out with the Mac Book Pro.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.040]   And suddenly people were going, what?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.720]   I'm a processor behind.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.680]   And the Mac Pro's just came out.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.960]   Now, imagine that next month they come out
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.640]   with the bigger then.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.960]   So they've got the huge processors in there.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.040]   And what happens to all those people who say, wait a minute.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.080]   I really expect to have sort of be on top of the heap
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.760]   for at least six months instead of three.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.240]   So I think this we're probably looking at something
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.120]   like when Leopard comes out that this would be a nice package
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.840]   to say, hey, look, we've got a new operating system.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.400]   And we've got this.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.280]   And it'll run everything.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.120]   And you can do 70,000 things at the same time
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.840]   with these wonderful processors.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Now, what we've also seen is you
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.120]   should be able to buy upgrade kits.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.360]   So if you can't wait for Apple to do this,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.320]   it does appear that you can get an upgrade.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.840]   You'll be able to upgrade these to eight processors.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.320]   Those chips that are in your Mac Pro right now are upgradeable.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.760]   So it does look like it might be possible to move your Mac Pro up.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.880]   No, does anyone here have a Mac Pro?
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.200]   No, nobody--
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.640]   You have one.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.240]   I do.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.400]   So are you thinking about upgrading it?
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   Is that something you want?
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.640]   Eight processors a power.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.520]   I'm waiting for the 32 core quad.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.680]   Triple whatever.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.120]   With 128 gigabytes of RAM.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.440]   I'm looking for 64 processors and not one less than that.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.240]   No, and this brings up another issue, which is that, of course,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.000]   it's great to have eight processors,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.320]   but a lot of applications won't actually see eight processors.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.640]   Don't know exactly how to use them efficiently
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.360]   if they're not multi-threaded.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.200]   And so it's questionable.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.280]   There's been a couple things on the web here
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.120]   that have questioned whether 8-procs are overkill.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.080]   Does it really make a difference to get 8-procs right now?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.600]   One of the things that the guys that were testing it
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.680]   brought up was that they couldn't actually max out the 8-core.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.040]   These are the guys that were testing on the Mac Pro.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.720]   And that's not good that they can't max them out.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.480]   It means that the system around them
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.760]   can't give them enough information at one time.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.200]   I'm worried about things like, are the buses to and from
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.160]   all those processors wide enough?
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.200]   But yeah, you're right, Alex.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.640]   This software isn't there yet.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.600]   I'm running Pro Tools, which is the biggest application
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.320]   I use on my computer.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.000]   And Pro Tools is not able to take advantage
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.920]   of the processors I have, let alone the ones coming down
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.480]   the road.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.000]   I'm sure this stuff will all be rewritten
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.280]   to take advantage of multiple processors
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.400]   and multi-threading and all that.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.760]   But very few programs today truly take advantage of it.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.640]   And then we do have to ask the question, maybe Chris is
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   gang over there at Macworld who has done some testing.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.240]   But are these buses wide enough to handle 8-16-32 processors?
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.800]   Well, I think what we're looking for really is software.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.520]   I mean, sure the hardware is important.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.760]   But as you say, if the operating system isn't optimized to
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.560]   take care of this stuff, nor are the applications,
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.640]   then you've got a lot of processors sitting around
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.280]   twiddling their thumbs.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.680]   And that's another reason why I see the synchronicity
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.560]   of this happening when the operating system can take
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.080]   advantage of it, when Apple's had a chance to take
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.360]   aperture and final cut.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.920]   And those really processor intensive applications
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.280]   and do something with them so they can show off the hardware
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.440]   to its best advantage.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.600]   But currently, what's the point?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.120]   And Pro Tools, I mean, wait forever, because Digi is not
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.760]   the fastest company in the world at getting its applications
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.640]   up and running with current technology.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   But you do want to look at maybe Adobe, which is maybe
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.280]   not a good example, but certainly Apple's stuff to see that
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.880]   it's going to take advantage of that.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.840]   Well, wait a minute, Digi has been optimized to run with
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.920]   the OS 10.0.0.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.120]   So come on, Chris.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.200]   Yeah, they're getting there by gum.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.280]   And once they stop buying companies and spend a little
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.600]   more time developing their software, then they're really
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.280]   going to be there.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.120]   Well, that's what happens.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.800]   I mean, this is always what happens when you get on the top
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   of the heap.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.760]   It's easier to take your time and do what you need to do
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.000]   because you don't have the competition that you need to
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.720]   kind of prod you along a little bit.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.680]   Now, Adobe, not only are they taking advantage of Apple's
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.920]   new hardware, they're only supporting it with their new
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.040]   software Sound Booth.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.760]   Is it Sound Booth?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.880]   Is that right?
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.360]   That's correct.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.880]   Sound Booth was released.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.480]   The beta was released this week.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.680]   And now, has anyone played with Sound Booth yet?
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.320]   Has anyone doodled about this a little bit?
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.720]   I have a little bit, yeah.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.640]   It's actually a fairly interesting little application.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   It's not a replacement for Audition or Soundtrack.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   It's a much lower level type of thing, really designed for
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.680]   people who don't do a lot of professional audio.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.720]   So a lot of this stuff is kind of automatic.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.440]   But it does have some of the features in Audition that are
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.080]   really interesting.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.520]   It has the color spectral view, the ability to select sound in
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.040]   the color spectral view and delete it, which is something
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.240]   that Soundtrack we all.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.840]   We all wish Soundtrack had.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   And so the Hubidihaw, I mean, this is Mac and Windows, but
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.800]   the Hubidihaw is that they're only supporting Intel.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.320]   Do you think that's a good idea?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.560]   The Intel chips is what I mean.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.480]   They're not supporting PowerPC at all.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.240]   Chris, do you think that that was a good process for Adobe?
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.880]   Why did they do that?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.680]   Well, they have essentially turned around and said, as far as
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.960]   Apple is concerned, the PowerPC processor is dead to them.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.480]   And they claim they're following Apple's lead.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.200]   And if you look in the blog of some of the people developing
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.400]   this stuff, they're saying, look, this is the future.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.120]   Intel is where Apple is at.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.360]   That's where we're going, going forward.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.160]   We don't need to spend a lot of our time going back and making
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.200]   this compatible with older machines, because we want to
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.920]   get this out.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   We want to get it working.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.760]   And we know you want us to get this working as well as
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.680]   evidenced by other Adobe products that we're still waiting
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.600]   for native compatibility for the Intel processor.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.840]   So I think their decision to do it is perfectly OK.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.920]   On the other hand, you have people that are in this business
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.440]   who are audio engineers.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   And audio engineers are closely linked to musicians.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.680]   And as everybody knows, these people are starving to death
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.200]   and don't have a lot of money and don't have a lot of new
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.720]   equipment.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.320]   So unless you're at the Alex Lindsey level, where you're
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.640]   constantly buying new gear every day, a lot of these guys are
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.040]   working in studios, and they've got the old stuff.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.800]   They're lucky to have a G5.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.600]   A lot of them are still working on equipment that's older
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.080]   than that.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.640]   And for them, the PowerPC is a month.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.880]   Fortunately, this isn't a must-have application.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.600]   There are plenty of other things on the Macintosh already
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.920]   that can do much of what this is doing if you want more
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.280]   powerful audio programs.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.320]   They're out there.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.840]   Some of the capabilities that are in this can be found by
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.520]   combining another couple of programs.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.280]   So it's not a must-have application.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.160]   But I understand their argument that, like, look, for us,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.720]   we really do need PowerPC compatibility.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.920]   Especially when you're looking at something that didn't
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.520]   exist before, they're not making anybody upset, so to speak.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.000]   And since it's in beta, really, by the time it becomes mature,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.640]   if we look at Lightroom as an indicator, by the time it
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.560]   actually gets out of beta, it's going to-- really, 80% of
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.360]   their market, I think, is going to be largely in using some
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.960]   kind of Intel machine.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.520]   So the people who, I think, would be most likely to buy it.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.080]   I think that what I'm excited about, I know, is that I go
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.640]   back and forth.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.480]   I use Soundtrack primarily for Post.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.160]   But there's a couple of little features.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.360]   And one specific feature, and that's being able to select
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.160]   certain things in the spectral view and get rid of them.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:03.480]   So if I've got a fan up at 18K, and I want to take that out,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.160]   I can select that in Audition and just simply delete it.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.480]   And I can do the same thing with Soundbooth.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.240]   The big problem has been, is I've had to go back through
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.960]   Bootcamp and go over to Audition and do this, and then
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.160]   bring it back into Soundtrack if I really wanted to do the
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.760]   work, because Soundtrack doesn't have that feature.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.840]   Which, by the way, Bootcamp was upgraded this week.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.920]   Are you guys using Bootcamp at all?
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.720]   No.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   Not at all.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.800]   Absolutely not.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.080]   I've used it a little bit.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.400]   It's fine.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.840]   If I wanted to have--
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.520]   What?
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.640]   If I wanted to have viruses and spyware and blue screens
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.680]   of death, I would buy $400 windows.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.800]   I want access to those viruses.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.720]   I thought the soundbit was kind of an odd little app.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.840]   I mean, I play with it a little bit.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.320]   And as somebody who's spending a little bit more time doing
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.440]   audio stuff, I'm always kind of looking for what's out there.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.920]   But I found it kind of confusing in a couple ways.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.160]   I mean, the one thing that I really liked about it is
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.000]   something that it seemed to do well that other audio apps
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.160]   don't do well, is to expose in, if you will, layman's terms
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.320]   the kinds of little tasks that we need to do with audio.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.440]   I mean, again, let's go back to the way we talk about
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.000]   Photoshop, and how Photoshop is so far beyond 80/20 in terms
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200]   of the features that you use.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.880]   I mean, you almost want an app that just kind of does those
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.640]   15 things that you need.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.040]   Sound Booth exposes this way of saying, hey, here's the way
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.120]   to take out Pops.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   You just use this little tool.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.040]   And I've used-- so I've played with Gosh, now I play with
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.760]   Amadeus II, I've played with Sound Studio, I've played with
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.600]   Fishin, I've played with so many of these apps.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.960]   And they're all good, and they all support all these plugins.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.040]   But they don't make it necessarily the most human
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.600]   language.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.840]   And I think that's one interesting thing that they seem
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.480]   to be trying to do inside of that incredibly odd interface
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.400]   that they have, is to expose that stuff to the average user.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.160]   I'm with you on the odd interface, though, because I'm
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.680]   accustomed to using audio editors.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.000]   I feel right at home when I open something on the day,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   or Fishin, because that's--
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.600]   You know where stuff is.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.120]   Exactly.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.200]   It's like, oh, that's a waveform.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.720]   I get it.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.800]   Oh, there's that.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.400]   OK, but I opened up the Adobe thing, and I go, what?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   What kind of stuff is that?
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.560]   It seemed like something that I would just have to really
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.360]   kind of relearn from the bottom up.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.320]   Because my attention span is not good.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.880]   I ended up just kind of putting it away.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.120]   But I'm not sure who it's targeted at.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.840]   I mean, I see here what you're saying, Alex, about all
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.200]   that spectral stuff.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.480]   That's all pops and buzzes to me.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.680]   I have no idea what that means.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.040]   But just that basic functionality,
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.720]   I'll obviously stuff like that, come into a lower end app.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.680]   Well, I think that actually what I'm using it for is something
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.880]   actually, probably fairly esoteric, given the rest of the app.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.560]   The app there, for the most part, is really designed for people
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.600]   who don't do any audio.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.960]   They're an editor.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.280]   And it's amazing how many times I'll talk to an editor and I'll
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.480]   say, why don't you compress that audio a little bit?
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.560]   And they're like, well, I'll just compress it when I make it
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.240]   ready for the web.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.960]   And I'm like, well, that's not what I mean.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.400]   We're doing audio compression here.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.760]   We need to reduce the contrast between the highs and the lows
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.920]   of the volume.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.960]   And this is something that, for instance, Sound Booth makes
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.040]   fairly--
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.920]   it's fairly easy.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.440]   I have to admit, I'm kind of particular about that kind of
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.720]   thing.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.360]   And I want more control than I'm getting.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.880]   I wish we would do something a little bit more like--
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.960]   what's that program about?
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.840]   Audio hijack.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.160]   Or audio hijack, if you're a guitar player and you're used
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.480]   to the metaphor of your effects boxes being in a row,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.080]   you understand what happens.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.640]   You want to put your digital delay after your distortion,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.440]   for example.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.600]   And so I think with something like hijack, if you guys
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.520]   ever use that, you kind of drag and drop the things that you
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.560]   want to do.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.400]   And then you have controls inside of each of those little
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.280]   boxes.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.160]   And that's a metaphor that I would find really valuable.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:40.480]   I don't know.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.880]   It just seemed like this was a pretty complicated interface
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.600]   for something that it seemed like a pretty simple app in a
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.440]   lot of ways.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   Let me jump in here and say that if you're using Soundflower,
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.880]   you cannot use Sound Booth.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.440]   You can't use--
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.360]   --the Flour copchers, the beeps and buzzes of your Mac.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.400]   What happens is Sound Booth just crashes on Open.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.320]   Really?
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.480]   Yeah, there's a bug already in the beta that they've found
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.640]   that there's a process that Soundflower tries to use that
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.360]   makes Sound Booth crash.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.920]   So as of yesterday, I still have not been able to open Sound
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.040]   Booth because I am not going to disable Soundflower in order
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.000]   to do it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.480]   OK.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.840]   Well, that's--
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.400]   I have so many different computers that I have this
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.080]   to float around on.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.800]   I guess I have Soundflower, I guess, on one of my laptops,
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.880]   but I don't have it on the one that I was testing it on.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   Now, another big thing in the news here,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.920]   Apple is rumored to have a deal with Singular.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.160]   I guess this is probably the big news of the week.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.960]   This is the Apple Singular deal.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.000]   People say is coming.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.240]   People say is--
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.720]   once again, this is pushing us towards, is there an iPhone?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   Yes.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   Yes.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.560]   There's an iPhone.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.160]   Thank you.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.640]   Thank you.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.600]   Yeah, I can't-- the problem now is that even if Apple wasn't
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.320]   designing an iPhone, I think that everyone's
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.360]   going to be pretty disappointed at Mac world
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.320]   if we don't get one.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.680]   It's-- Apple would almost have to come out and just tell everyone
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.160]   over and over and over again right now that we're not going--
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.480]   Listen, it's no problem.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.080]   I'm going to stand there with a gun on Chris and tell Steve
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.560]   that if there's no iPhone, Chris gets it.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.600]   Yeah, well, there'll be no iPhone than the other.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.240]   Go ahead.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.680]   The only thing worse than being shot is being steaved.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.120]   Yeah, so the--
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.640]   That's Steve once did, yeah, Alex.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.480]   I have been steaved, and it wasn't-- it was very painful.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.240]   So the-- I prefer not to be--
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.360]   not to be steaved again.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   So it looks like it's coming--
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.480]   it feels like it's coming.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.160]   Now, the other thing that came out this week that may or may not
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.320]   be connected to it is this--
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.040]   are some of the patents that Apple has--
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.280]   applies for a long time.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.520]   It's not like they just put them out.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.480]   I think a lot of people when they see these patents think
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.320]   that Apple put this in for patent release.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.800]   But a lot of times this stuff sits, Scott,
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.560]   can you explain a little bit about the patent process,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.320]   of how long this stuff takes to go through?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.080]   Yeah, they have to apply for patents early
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.280]   because there's more and more searches required these days
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.360]   because it's more complicated.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.280]   But Apple has been known to patent things
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.240]   just to keep other people from getting to it.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.320]   That's a pretty traditional intellectual property
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.200]   technique.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.960]   But I do think that the flurry of patents-- we've now
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.880]   counted six, I believe, related to the iPhone
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.400]   or a potential iPhone.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.600]   I think it's enough positive momentum to believe it's true.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.640]   I do want to also mention that we actually already
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.280]   talked about this singular deal.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.360]   It was actually broken about five, six weeks ago.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.240]   I think what's happened is it's now just
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.080]   come forward to reality.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.360]   It was a discussion five or six weeks ago.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.560]   Now I think they may have even signed contracts.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.480]   So if you look at that and you look at all the other stuff
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.800]   we're hearing, and the other reason I think it's true
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.160]   is that it hasn't appeared on Think Secret yet.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.720]   If it's on Think Secret, it's generally not true.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.360]   I'm sitting here holding my second gen shuffle, which
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.800]   according to Think Secret won't be shipping until November.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.360]   And they were also the people that told us
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   aperture was out of business.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   So they haven't made such a prediction yet.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.720]   So therefore, I believe very firmly, the iPhone is coming.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.920]   Well, it is November in Australia.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.640]   So maybe you just got there some of Southern Hemisphere
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.440]   edition.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.400]   OK.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.720]   Yeah, I'm very excited, actually, about giving the nano.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.800]   Now you ordered the nano online?
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   No, I got the shuffle.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   The shuffle.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   Oh, sorry, the shuffle.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.360]   The little teeny--
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.160]   The wee, wee, wee, wee, little one.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.800]   Now that's actually what I'm looking forward to.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.360]   But I guess every day I go over the Apple store.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.160]   And now it's not like I travel somewhere.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.680]   The Apple store in San Francisco
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.080]   is 100 feet from our office.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.440]   So when I go to lunch often times, I wander through.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   And I look longingly at much of the hardware.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.560]   And one of the things I keep on asking for is,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.960]   when is the shuffle going to show up?
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.000]   And they're like, well, we don't even know.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.440]   I got mine today.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.480]   And by the way, in case you all haven't noticed it yet,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.080]   I tuned 7.0.2 has been released today.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.680]   And that adds shuffle support.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   Right.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.600]   So it's going to be-- I'm actually pretty excited about it.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.240]   I mean, I'm mostly just getting one for a--
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.080]   as a workout, you know, workout iPod.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.200]   Given that I lost my other iPod last night.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.680]   You lost it last night?
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.360]   I lost it at the gym.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.560]   I left it somewhere.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.360]   Well, you know what you need to do, Alex?
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.120]   It was an old one, though.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.960]   You take old ones there.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.120]   You need to put a GPS locator on your iPod.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.160]   And then you can use your TomTom to find it.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   I really do.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:39.400]   I have lost-- I have now lost three iPods at the gym.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.360]   Maybe they'll give you some kind of a volume discount.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   I know.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.240]   That's $6.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.640]   Well, they're always the ones I use in the gym.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   I work out pretty hard.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.680]   So the ones that I use at the gym are usually the oldest ones
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.240]   I have.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.680]   And so I had a 5-gig one that I was using until a year ago.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.640]   And one of the generation ones that I was still surprised
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.120]   was still alive.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.800]   You get to do a gen one to incorporate that into your workout,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.160]   just account for the extra 10 pounds.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.120]   But I think I can hang on to the little nano.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.680]   That's my-- or the shuffle I mean.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.320]   I think I can hang on to that one.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   I think it'll be easier.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.120]   The thing is very, very small.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.920]   Yeah, so I'm excited to--
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.120]   And it does clip to you.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.200]   I do have to admit that I think that when they say that they've
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.800]   sold-- they talk about how the market--
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.560]   I saw this report where they said the market can't get much
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.040]   bigger.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.960]   I mean, Apple sold 40 million iPods this year,
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.760]   but the market can't get that much larger.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.640]   And I don't think they're realizing that a lot of us just
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.080]   keep on buying all of them.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.960]   Right now, with Envision, I have three iPods sitting on my desk.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.920]   I think there's some of us that just keep on slowly collecting
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.640]   iPods.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.760]   Yeah, half these iPods are going to go through the wash
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.260]   anyway.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.960]   So you're going to have to buy it.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.200]   With the shuffle, absolutely.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.720]   They do because they clip to your clothing.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.840]   So of course, they're going to go through the wash.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.280]   I got mine to use in my car because the big one takes up
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.840]   just no convenient place on the dash to lay it.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.480]   So the little small one perfectly happens
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.280]   to clip to a little thing on my dashboard.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   And that's the reason I bought it.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.560]   I may introduce just a note of reality here.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.640]   I mean, we've talked about the 1G iPod
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.960]   and these things being so big.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.760]   I mean, can we think back to about seven years ago
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.400]   when we were carrying Walkman about the size of our heads
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   that held like 30 minutes of music?
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.440]   And now we go, oh, yeah, well, that only had 1,000 songs.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.960]   You know, I had a creative jukebox.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.800]   I had a creative jukebox that, having said that,
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.840]   I think it was six gigs.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.080]   But this is maybe $1,999 or $2,000.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.840]   And it weighed about as much as a chimp.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.120]   But it did a lot of music.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.360]   But I mean, seriously, the thing was huge.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.440]   It was like carrying a tire around.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.520]   Yeah, absolutely right.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.000]   We could spoil fast.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.320]   Although I will say I dropped--
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.200]   Because the standpoint, the thing that kind of amazes me,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.320]   I'm sure you guys have seen this.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.480]   But in San Francisco, I noticed this
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.600]   from Christmas last year, our Macy's
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.240]   got one of those big snapple machines
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   that spits out Apple products.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.640]   Have you guys seen those?
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.760]   It's a big vending machine.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.960]   I saw one at--
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.720]   I saw one at the portable media Expo had one.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.160]   That's right.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.320]   We saw one in Ontario, California
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.680]   at the convention center, Alex.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.120]   And it had all kinds of stuff.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.960]   And I have to say that Ontario, California
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.600]   was not where I expected to go to find a high tech vending
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.640]   machine.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.240]   That's not the first place that would have popped into my head.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.760]   But--
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.400]   To me, that's the thing to watch is--
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   I mean, just from my consumer standpoint,
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.680]   is who would have thought in 1983,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.600]   when we were saving up to buy our merleons CDs,
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.720]   that you would eventually be able to go to Walgreens
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.200]   and pick up a shrink-wrap CD player for whatever $30 or $50.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.680]   And I think that's what's really interesting to watch,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.720]   as the prices start dropping on this stuff
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.680]   in the next few years.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.120]   And just back to this point of Apple and the sales,
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.720]   we don't buy one iPod.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.440]   If you're like my household and you're
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.480]   a couple of dorks, you've got four.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.160]   And setting aside people like Carl Lagerfeld, who reportedly
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.640]   have-- how many of these Carl Lagerfeld have?
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.840]   Have you guys ever seen that?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.720]   He actually had special boxes made,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.160]   so he can carry around.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.960]   He has these whole lunch boxes full of iPods
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.440]   with a bajillion songs on all of these.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.720]   It's like an array of iPods.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   So and he has them at all his different houses.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.960]   You know, I've often thought of building an iPod raid,
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.200]   just to see what kind of bandwidth it can get.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.360]   That's where I think the trajectory that's interesting
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.240]   to watch is as this becomes less of something that's like a--
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.960]   it's less like buying a new car and more like,
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.800]   I don't know, replacing a shirt in some ways.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.040]   It is going to grow to the point of being a commodity,
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.720]   in my opinion, because it's going to be much like the razors
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.200]   and the razor blades.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.000]   Eventually, the real money is going to be in the songs,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.760]   not the players.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.920]   And we'll see the cost.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.840]   The players come down.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.360]   The size of the players come down.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.200]   We'll see probably the cost of the songs
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.720]   go up if the music companies have their way.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.600]   And you're right.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.120]   I mean, I own four iPods right now.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.600]   It's also interesting to think, you know,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   we've gone around on this one three or four times, too.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.480]   And I've whined about it.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.800]   But the whole thing of not having an easy way
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.080]   to read down your library or to have it accessible
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.160]   from multiple places.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.560]   To me, that's a model that starts looking more attractive.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.680]   As you say, OK, well, I lost this iPod.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.240]   But as soon as I go wheels down in New York,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.640]   I can pick up a new one and pick all my music up off of T1
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.000]   line at the hotel.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.480]   That's actually--
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.200]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.440]   I mean, again, that's the labels that are holding it up.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.480]   So, you know, boo-hoo.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.840]   So also in the news--
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.640]   and this comes up every time Apple puts a new release out--
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.040]   is that, of course, someone announces
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.880]   that they got that new release to work on a regular PC.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.960]   So Apple has been--
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.320]   Apple will put out something to know.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.360]   And now they're showing it running, you know, the X86.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.920]   So one of the interesting things about this--
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.680]   one of the more recent ones that has been put up
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.720]   is that it actually--
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.760]   the Colonel Coder, a guy named Semthex--
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.320]   or that's the code name--
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.680]   Semthex posted this that he says is entirely legal.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.360]   This is actually running without the trusted platform
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:08.840]   module.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   So what he did is he actually launched it.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.640]   Now, you don't get any of the GUI.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.000]   You just get the back end.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.960]   You get the OS X--
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.920]   everything except for the GUI.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.880]   But it's running OS X, essentially, but without the front
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.800]   end, which is useful if you're a researcher, not as useful
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:32.440]   if you're a regular person that actually wants to use a GUI.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.640]   But there's also a lot of people constantly cracking.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.200]   Does this mean anything to Apple?
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.400]   Do you think Apple really cares that people are cracking OS
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.720]   X and putting it on a regular PC?
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.760]   No one knows.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.400]   No one cares.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:45.880]   Not in this form.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.200]   I mean, nobody cares in this form.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.440]   The whole attraction of OS X is having OS X
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   like it's supposed to look with a smiley face,
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.200]   and it's very friendly.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.280]   And that's why we like it.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.920]   Because otherwise, we're on Unix.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.200]   And you've got all that command line stuff
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   and have a wonderful time.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.720]   And good on you.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.600]   I mean, there seems to be this thing
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.160]   that people think that they're going to crack.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.120]   Somehow, they're going to just keep on cracking OS X
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.000]   and they're going to put it on a PC.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.520]   And somehow, that's going to force Apple to adopt
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.120]   the licensing of their operating system.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.800]   But most people, I think, who buy a Mac,
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.960]   I mean, the reason they're buying it
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.040]   is so they don't have to fiddle with all that stuff.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.240]   Well, I think also you just end up on this merry-go-round.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:31.640]   It's like the situation with DVD John and Apple's DRM.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.880]   You come out with some of it.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.480]   You crack it.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.400]   You make it work on something it's not supposed to.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.440]   And then Apple says, oh, OK.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.240]   And they turn a switch.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   And then it doesn't work anymore.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.920]   And then you go back to the lab and you break it again.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.160]   And then Apple turns another switch and they break it again.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.600]   And it's just--
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.160]   I think it's a hobby if you've got nothing else
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:47.760]   to do in your life.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.440]   But I think for practical use is, I certainly
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.520]   wouldn't want to be the consumer that was depending
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.600]   on somebody's scheme to get around something that Apple's
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.200]   doing because it's very clear that Apple doesn't care
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.520]   to share certain things with the rest of the world.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.000]   iTunes DRM being one and OS X being the other.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.080]   And I think that this always brings up
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   this conversation that--
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.960]   and I believe--
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.320]   I hope I'm not incorrect here.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.720]   But I believe it was the Gartner group that once again said
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:19.040]   that I think in a conference last week, they said
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.920]   that they thought that Apple should--
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.680]   once again, they said Apple should release this.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.800]   You just forget about the hardware.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.560]   They should just license the software,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.800]   make it available to everyone.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.280]   And that would be good for Apple.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   My argument has always been that why it's a good experience
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.960]   is partially because you have control over it.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.200]   All the aspects of what you're dealing with.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.880]   Do you guys think-- should Apple think about licensing
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.360]   out their operating system?
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.200]   I don't think so because everybody's--
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.840]   every poll we've taken, every investigation we've
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.680]   looked into this stuff says people like it
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.000]   that Apple's a closed system.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.640]   They like the way Apple does business.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.680]   There's a certain special click or group or club
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.600]   or whatever that we all belong to that use Apple's.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.720]   And I think that there's much more likelihood
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.280]   that we'll see more development in the way of Windows users
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.320]   trying to run the Apple OS--
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.400]   I mean, excuse me, backwards.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.000]   More likelihood of Windows trying
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.040]   to be put over on the Apple computing system
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.200]   rather than the Windows people trying to use the Apple OS.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.440]   It's just-- I don't think there's that big of market.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.040]   Do you, Chris?
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.280]   I don't think so.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.200]   And I think you're right about people
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.160]   preferring it the way it is.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.880]   Back in the old clone days, yes, I
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.520]   liked having a power computing machine that
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.040]   was less expensive than an Apple computer and more powerful.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   But I also like the relationship between the iPod
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.800]   and iTunes and the relationship between Apple's hardware
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.720]   and OS X because Apple controls everything.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.280]   And they work seamlessly together.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.080]   And you don't get that kind of experience on a Windows box.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.600]   I talk to it.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.920]   That's why we don't have viruses.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.480]   And that's why we don't have spyware.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.200]   And that's why we don't have all those problems.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   Well, I was talking to a developer.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.120]   This is a while ago.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.320]   And they were talking about their development process.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.800]   And they said, well, when we develop from Mac,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.160]   we've got like three different machines.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.840]   We've got to make sure it runs on all of those.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.360]   When we developed for PC, they had 27 machines
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.720]   that they had to test their software against to make sure
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.480]   that it actually worked.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   Because there's all these different configurations,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.040]   all these different ways that all these different cards,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.720]   all these different drivers, all these things,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.360]   that they had to make sure that it all worked.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.480]   And it was just-- even for a developer,
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.480]   it was much more complicated to keep all of that stuff running.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.000]   But that's why a lot of stuff is a little less--
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.600]   oftentimes, less stable in that area.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   I don't see how that would be any interesting anywhere
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.440]   beyond a parlor trick.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.080]   I mean, it's-- yeah, it's fun if you can make that work.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.600]   And that's kind of a hobbyist thing.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.480]   It's kind of cool.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.040]   But I mean, I guess I just don't understand.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.920]   I mean, on a PC, is the idea here that we--
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.800]   so someone's saying we want to be able to, whatever we call it,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.600]   crack OS10 so that it can run on a PC.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.000]   Because we don't want to buy a Mac because it's too expensive.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.760]   Is that the idea?
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.000]   That's the theory.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.520]   But the thing is, is that once you start--
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.600]   and this has been-- people have done this over and over again--
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.120]   once you start actually adding up,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.000]   when you look at what you're getting with a given Mac,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.600]   and when you built a PC up to that same level,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.000]   oftentimes, unless you're building it yourself,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.160]   oftentimes that price is going to be the same or more.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.000]   Yeah, I mean, the buttons aren't hooked up to anything.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.720]   I mean, you might as well draw a Mac on a cardboard box,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.080]   right?
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.400]   I mean, you--
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   I'm not sure.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.200]   Yeah, I never had one of the power computing ones.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.120]   I've always had Macs.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.200]   But I don't think there's any--
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.560]   speaking of someone who has no idea
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.600]   how to make these kinds of decisions,
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.560]   but I can't imagine that that would be anything
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.360]   that they would think about.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.760]   At this point, it seems to me the play there,
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.800]   making a saying that call it a click or call it whatever.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.000]   I think what they're saying is there's
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.280]   a substantially different experience to doing this
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.360]   that you may or may not like.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.920]   But if you do like it, then you're
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.800]   going to want all this stuff to work together.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.640]   And you could do that reliably on a Mac.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.960]   And the thing is, let's not be ridiculous about it.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.800]   It's not impossible to do on Windows.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.200]   But it's not something that's--
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.280]   just from what I hear from reports from people,
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.880]   it's not as easy.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.640]   But there's a whole line of questioning is making me queasy.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.400]   Well, let's jump into-- there's another rumor
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.360]   that's floating around.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.120]   Once again, now every year we have to have this rumor startup
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.160]   in about October, October, November,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.840]   you have to have the 50-inch Apple Monitor rumor.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.760]   I think it's like required that we're
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   going to get our big 50-inch HD display.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.960]   And the idea here, I think this is from Gizmodo,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.520]   put this up this week.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:33.080]   And the issue is that is Apple going
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.200]   to build this super display?
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.000]   I mean, they have a 30-inch, a 50-inch.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.960]   It's really what that is.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.200]   It's not so much a new monitor.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:46.040]   It's really just a LCD display that happens to also
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.880]   have an input that you can run your computer to.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.600]   And the question is, as Apple develops ITV,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.080]   as they develop all of this integration,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   why wouldn't they make it easier for you to just integrate
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.800]   directly to a monitor that they build,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.400]   close the system all the way down?
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:02.760]   You think--
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.160]   I'm doing that now in my 42-inch plasma.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.040]   And that's too big.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.160]   I've got a Mac Mini connected to my Panasonic 42-inch plasma.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.720]   And it's great for watching movies through the DVD player.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.080]   But if I try to operate the Mac,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.920]   if I'm sitting within wire distance, I'm too close.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.000]   And if I sit across the room, it's just creepy.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   So--
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.600]   I mean, yes, for editing movies makes sense.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.520]   Yeah, you can edit it.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.400]   Unlike this is how people are going to see it.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.400]   But for everyday sort of use, I don't
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.200]   want to surf the web on a 50-inch plasma display.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.320]   It's just too much.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:38.960]   I agree.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.080]   I tried looking at Chris's television.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   I emailed him and said, what did you buy?
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.800]   And I went down and looked at one.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.720]   And I thought, this is just too big.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.960]   And as somebody who enjoys having the largest of everything,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.640]   even for me to say it's too big, it must really be too big.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.280]   So I also think that people need to understand
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.960]   the technology behind doing a 50-inch display versus a 30.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.040]   It's not exactly one of those two-to-one metrics.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.160]   It's like 100 times harder.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.440]   Merlin, can you imagine--
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.040]   The only reason I can think of that--
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.920]   I mean, personally, I couldn't use a 50-inch monitor.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.400]   I would feel really ridiculous if I had a monitor of that.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.240]   Especially for what it would inevitably cost.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.760]   But I'll say it would look kind of cool.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.920]   It's in an Apple store.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.600]   It's the kind of thing where people walk in
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.480]   and they go, holy crap, they don't
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.280]   have that over at the top USA or whatever.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.680]   So yeah, there would definitely be some wow factor to it.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.600]   But I think it's probably safe for you
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.440]   to put that back into the annual rumor bin.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.080]   Now, I actually have an 80-inch monitor that I--
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.600]   Really?
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.120]   --occasionally, yeah.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.080]   What do you keep that?
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.400]   I keep it on my wall with a projector.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.200]   Yeah, so I--
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.160]   Yeah, I will, when doing certain kinds of work
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.480]   or when I feel like relaxing, I actually
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.920]   have a projector in my office.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.240]   We have a backup projector for our main one
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.920]   that we do presentations with.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.120]   So you always have to have one if you're doing seminars.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.920]   So if it goes bad, you can swap it out if no one--
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.520]   Are you being serious?
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.960]   So I have a backup projector that sits in my office
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.080]   that we don't use very often.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.200]   I'm not allowed to use it that often
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.840]   because we can't blow out the bulb or anything
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.600]   because it's the backup.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.000]   But occasionally, when I'm doing work
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.480]   or I feel like watching lost on a big screen,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.560]   I will-- you know, I just fire up the projector and hit play.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.480]   And one of the--
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.080]   a couple days ago, I was actually
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.920]   playing with this program called Silhouette FX,
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.120]   and it's a roto tool.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.280]   It does rotoscoping.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.440]   And you draw these little lines around everybody
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.080]   on every frame.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.000]   And so I was testing it, and I was like, man,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.080]   this is just a pain in the neck.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.720]   I'm crouched over looking at my monitor.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.920]   And so I put it up on the projector.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.000]   It was awesome.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.560]   It was awesome because you have to pay attention
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.920]   to all these little details.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.840]   And it was great to have this massive screen.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.440]   So that's why I got excited about the possibility of 15 inch.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.800]   I could actually live into that possibility.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.720]   And that's why the slogan that they're going for
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.840]   is, large screens for lonely men.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   Wow.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.240]   Because you know, you've got to think about,
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.920]   should I get the kids diapers, or should I get the 18 inch
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.400]   screen?
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.360]   I just want to say that that last exchange, Chris,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.680]   one time you accused me of being a geek,
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.560]   I think you have to say that while I may be a geek,
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.880]   I am a mini geek compared to Alex.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.560]   No, this is part of his stock in trade though.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.160]   I mean, he's not--
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.320]   No, he wins, you know, because he writes all this stuff off.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.960]   So he's OK with it.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.480]   Also, people get him.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.560]   A lot of people send me lots of stuff.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.320]   My current favorite thing that showed up at the office
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.840]   was this--
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.800]   Scott, did you see the M station?
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   I did.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.560]   And I know how it quote unquote showed up at the office.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.000]   You begged for it at the portable media.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   It is so--
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.320]   You were shamelessly begging for it in the room.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.360]   And it came.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.560]   It came and I love it.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.040]   We should have seen this.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.760]   Alex was down on both knees crying.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.400]   And we--
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.240]   I think that that might--
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.000]   He was speaking in Afrikaans.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.560]   He was so desperate.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.480]   Unlocking it in a free donut.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.640]   I was not speaking in Afrikaans.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.800]   That's all I have to say.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.560]   So I know I--
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   Scott, I've got the whole thing out there.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.000]   OK, that was the only other part of that story that was--
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.440]   The truth.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.840]   No, so you've got to get it.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.640]   The guys make a little bit of fun of me here in the office
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.640]   because there's this--
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.080]   M station makes this tower.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.520]   I don't know.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   I mean, it's like this thing that's like--
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.040]   I don't know, three or four feet high.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.840]   Four feet high.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.200]   It looks like something from Logan's room.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.840]   It's a little-- it's a little--
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.920]   it doesn't look quite as refined as what you'd expect
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.320]   from an MB3 player.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.720]   The whole thing is just designed to work with your iPod.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.640]   And it doesn't-- as I said, it's not the prettiest thing
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.080]   in the world, but the sound--
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.440]   it's the cleanest sound I've heard since I got rid
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.680]   of my Polk speakers on some traveling thing.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.320]   It's like 300 bucks.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.960]   I have to admit, it does sound very, very good.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.760]   Oh my gosh.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.360]   And I just haven't-- I just listen to it all the time,
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:47.800]   my office.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.880]   And so anyway, that's-- that and the other thing
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.280]   that I just got was the-- the Bodleman--
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.680]   have you seen this little USB microscope?
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.760]   Or is it like this-- anyway, I'll post pictures.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.080]   Yes.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.280]   You can check it out.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.440]   Anyway, that's my--
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.840]   Alex, we need to back up on this one moment, though,
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   because there's a disturbing trend here.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.280]   Yes.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.520]   You see, I was standing next to you when you were begging
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.400]   for this, and you obviously forgot the old saying,
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.200]   if you can get one, get two.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.120]   No, I actually--
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.640]   Because I'm sitting here, and I don't have my tower.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   I'll send you a ball.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.240]   I have the ball.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   I have it.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.040]   I'll get you a ball, and you can put that in your office
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.280]   and decide if you like that.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:28.600]   Thank you.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.200]   Thank you.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.880]   Yeah, no, no problem.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.080]   Thank you.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.120]   So have you guys seen this?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.560]   Did you see-- this was posted--
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.280]   the 10 apps that every new Mac user should download?
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   Did you see that?
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.480]   Yeah, I could see that.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.000]   Was that on our--
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.680]   Did you agree with it?
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.200]   I saw that on our--
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.080]   It was on the list.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   So here's the ones, and you guys can tell me
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.040]   whether you believe that these are the top 10.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.560]   A lot of these, I think, the rule was these are free apps.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.240]   They're not shareware.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.200]   They're not demos.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.880]   Is that the one that starts with Addium?
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:57.640]   That list?
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.600]   Addium or ADM or whatever you call that.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.720]   Now, does anyone use ADM or Addium?
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.200]   No.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.840]   Yeah, I do.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.440]   So there's ADM.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.920]   And what it is, is it's a burst of tile--
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.400]   You guys do it.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.840]   Are you guys using an iChat?
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.040]   I use iChat.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.880]   I use iChat as well.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.400]   I occasionally use iChat.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.600]   I have this problem that everyone talks to me
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.240]   when I'm on iChat.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.160]   So usually, you'll see me pop up for 25 seconds,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.320]   looking for somebody.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.600]   I'll pop up and I'll kind of look around a little bit,
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.960]   and then I don't see the person I'm looking for,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.120]   and then I disappear again.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.760]   In fact, a little periscope thing
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.040]   comes up on my iChat when you're on iChat.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   Usually, can you swap files over ADM?
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.920]   Yes.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.360]   It also has encryption, and it's got a metric
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.120]   assload of plug-ins that do all kinds of little different
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.440]   things.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.120]   Did you say a metric assload?
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.520]   Metric assload.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.880]   Is that a technical term?
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.800]   Yeah, I mean, up until the late '70s,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.360]   it was an imperial assload.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:54.880]   Oh.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.840]   Then after we switched over to metric, we did.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.320]   We switched over to--
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.600]   I thought just during that, Carter,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.160]   for like 10 minutes or so did.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.360]   And then we said, no, and we went back.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.640]   He's telling us to turn down our--
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.280]   Well, it was.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.840]   We were really going to metric assload.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.440]   And then over the last eight years,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.520]   we really moved back to an imperial assload.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.880]   It's like a lot of those little open source apps.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.680]   It thrives on the extensibility.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.760]   So if you kind of think Firefox for chat, maybe.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.960]   And so there's a lot of little neat plug-ins.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.400]   And yeah, I like it.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.120]   Again, it doesn't work with all the kind of out-of-the-box
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.760]   laziness that iChat does.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.480]   But it's very pretty.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.280]   And it feels more configurable to me.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   It actually feels more OS 10, like I've got to say,
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.840]   than the iChat does.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.600]   Next one on the list--
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.280]   Yeah, it took you off.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.480]   Go ahead.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.360]   Next one on the list is Cyberduck.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.760]   This is an FTP client.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.440]   Do you--
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.360]   I'm a transmit man.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.520]   Yeah, I use transmit.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.600]   You know, transmit is not--
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.880]   I use Cyberduck for secure FTP.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.560]   I use--
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.880]   Transmit does that just--
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.640]   Yeah, transmit's not free, but I use it for everything.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.480]   I can't imagine using anything else other than transmit.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.680]   Transmit has something that I'm not sure--
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.480]   I will put it in a very--
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.160]   It's got love is what it's got.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.280]   Well, here's something I'm not sure a lot of folks
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.520]   know Transmit does.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.680]   Do you guys use the Docsend functionality?
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.680]   I--
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.200]   I do not.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.600]   Well, let me tell you about the Docsend.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.680]   Docsend is the ability for me to go in and say, OK,
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.640]   here is the--
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.920]   I have a favorite.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.560]   So I have Bookmark basically an FTP subfolder on a web server.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.400]   And I associate that with-- I also
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.320]   bookmark a local directory.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.920]   And if you can think of it this way,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.320]   if I open up the Finder directory that's associated
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.760]   with my FTP directory and I drop any file
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.000]   under the Transmit icon, that's all I need to do
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.840]   for it to upload right to that directory.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.360]   Wow.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.760]   And it works with Quicksilver too.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.560]   My brain is now oozing out of my ear.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.040]   Well, I'm just thinking, like, if I
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.560]   had had this in 1995 when I was struggling with--
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.840]   what would it be back then, fetch?
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.200]   He could have been a contender.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.600]   I could have been a contender.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.520]   I could have been--
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.200]   I could have been like Jason Freed.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.000]   No, but it's--
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.560]   anyway, you start talking about the apps
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.840]   and you get me excited.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.520]   But I've never used Cyberduck.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's--
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.720]   I'm sure it's cool.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.000]   And if you need something that's free,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.120]   I mean, I have to admit that today--
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.640]   I mean, a lot of times when I get on a computer,
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.720]   I just open up the terminal and just--
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.600]   I'm very accustomed to a Unix shell.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.880]   So I'll just open up the terminal
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.760]   and just do SFDPAB.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.880]   And you know, let's set it up there.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.720]   Well, and that's why Transmit is such a great app
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.360]   for anybody who likes GUI and who likes the way a Mac works.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.400]   There's so much to it that's just sublime.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.360]   And the ability to edit on the server is fantastic.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.840]   And really--
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.560]   Any file hit command J and it opens right up in text made
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.320]   or whatever.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.600]   And all the panics software.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.040]   All the panics software is just--
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.960]   It's just linear.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.360]   Now, the next one on the list is Firefox.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   Does anyone use anything other than Firefox?
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:38.920]   I do.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.480]   I use Camino.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.400]   There you go.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.760]   I don't know why you--
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.520]   what makes Camino special?
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:45.920]   Other than--
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.280]   Camino.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.800]   You're different.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.360]   You're Mackey.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.320]   Very Mackey.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.200]   Oh, is it?
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.920]   It's very Mackey yet.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.360]   It's 100% standards compliant.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.040]   And you can open pages of Camino from Windows servers
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.960]   that you cannot open in any other browser.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.000]   Chris, what do you use?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.520]   I usually use Firefox.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.920]   I like Firefox too.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.720]   But every once in a while, I'll jump back to Safari
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.840]   because Safari is pretty fast.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.200]   And sometimes I've got enough stuff plugged into Firefox
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   that it slows down.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.080]   So what I need to do something very quickly I use Safari.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.160]   I use-- the only thing I use Safari for
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.840]   is that the way it sets up the RSS lists.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.240]   You know that I can grab--
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.320]   I have like 25 feeds.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.440]   And I'll say just give them to me in one long list
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.000]   sorted by chronologically.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.240]   And I can just see all the new stuff that's coming out.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.760]   And I can't do that in Firefox.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.160]   And so that's the only thing--
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.720]   literally the only thing I use Safari for.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.280]   So Safari-- I mean, this is something
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.440]   somebody like John Hicks could talk a lot smarter about.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.720]   But out of the box Safari is kind of B minus.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.400]   But if you add saps, Safari stand,
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.120]   and pith helmet, you've got a stew going.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.200]   That's serious.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.120]   What are those?
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:58.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.000]   And I use all that stuff.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.560]   Oh, gosh.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.760]   It does everything.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.720]   I mean, for example--
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.040]   No, for example, backup.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.560]   OK, backup.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.600]   So say this again.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.400]   Give you a couple of cookies.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.240]   One at a time.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   One is called Saffd, S-A-F-T.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.600]   What's Saffd?
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.640]   Well, you know what's so funny?
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.160]   I use these so much, I'm not even sure which does you.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.320]   Which is doing what?
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.400]   Yeah, you got three of them going.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.720]   I think that's actually a Firefox syndrome.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.800]   Where you're complaining to webmasters about something
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.360]   and it turns out it's plugging in a grease-mucking script
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.560]   you're using.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.880]   But for example, you can install--
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.200]   I think this is part of Safari stand.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.880]   But you know the little pulser, that little location,
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.440]   up in the upper right of your browser where you've got--
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.840]   you used to be where your little--
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.000]   where your little Mozilla with Paul.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.600]   You need to see the little Mozilla.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.000]   You can click on that while you're on a page and copy--
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.840]   or rather paste-- sorry, copy out of that as HTML,
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.000]   the name and URL of the page that you're on.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.520]   And if you do a lot of HTML editing,
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.320]   that sounds really trivial, but that saves me so much time
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.200]   every day, copying out of that.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.360]   All kinds of-- I mean, the one thing I would recommend
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.640]   to everybody, regardless of what browser you're using,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   find a way to be able to do keyword searching
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.720]   from your location bar.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.840]   So where do you something called?
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.480]   So goody for that.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.440]   So for example, any kind of a search
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.840]   where the terms are enclosed in the URL
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.760]   can be turned into an abbreviated search.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.400]   And you can do that in SAPT, and you can do that in SAPT.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.520]   So basically, if I want to do a search on Amazon,
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.800]   I just type AMZN space, and then my terms in the location bar
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.360]   and hit Enter, and it executes that search.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.240]   And I've got about 50 of those for everything from Costco
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.840]   to Walgreens to the local library.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.880]   I can do all those searches right from the menu bar.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.360]   Do you use that stuff, Chris?
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.240]   Yeah, I use some of that stuff.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.320]   A lot of the stuff I do is just to get rid of stuff
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.760]   I don't want to see anymore.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.840]   And so I can use SAP for getting rid of animations.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.000]   Increasingly, we're getting more of these blinking animations.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.320]   So I want to get rid of that stuff,
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.600]   because I don't care about it.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.920]   And I work for a company that has lots of advertising
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.000]   and lots of that stuff on it.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.440]   I block it out of my own company as well, because it's only fair.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.280]   Nobody else do it, please.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.440]   But I mean, actually, I think--
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.560]   I'm trying to remember the URL.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.840]   I'll look this up while you guys are talking.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.960]   But John Hicks has a whole site about--
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.160]   I think it's called Pimp My Safari at Memory Serves.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.040]   And it's full of great tips if you are using Safari.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.880]   And again, the nice thing, I used to piss and moan
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.760]   about all those Windows users who were, oh,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.400]   I got to have all my applications work together.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.920]   But I mean, the beauty is that that's how it works on OS10 now.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.800]   Safari works really well with these other apps.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.840]   It pulls in URLs from your address book and so on.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.200]   But--
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.040]   It's cool.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.800]   Awkward ranting.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   I like Safari.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.960]   I played with Flock.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.880]   I think if you're really into the kind of hipster
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.280]   to web 2.0, kind of stuff, Flock is a lot of fun.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.640]   I'm not that hip.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.240]   No, you're not.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:46.840]   I'm not.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.440]   You've got a big TV there.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.640]   I have a projector, but I don't have a TV at home.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.440]   It's kind of a mixture.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.720]   I have lots of stuff at the office.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.960]   But literally, most time, don't bring a laptop home.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.400]   And I don't have a microwave at home.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.200]   And I don't have a TV.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.400]   And I'm very--
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.640]   Make your own catch up?
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.360]   What?
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.320]   You make your own catch up?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.640]   I don't make my own catch up, but I
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.840]   have been considering making my own wine.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.340]   Really?
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.960]   Next time we get together, we'll talk about lining our own
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.280]   breaks and doing artisanal.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.080]   No, I don't do--
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:12.880]   Rattle alert.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.480]   Rattle alert.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:13.880]   I don't--
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   Rattle alert.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.380]   I don't--
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.220]   I prefer not to do anything with a car.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:23.000]   So anyway, I back up hard drive failures.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.780]   Does anyone use this?
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.940]   I use-- I have to admit, the other ones they mentioned here
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.220]   are carbon copy, cloner, and super duper.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.780]   And I actually use both of those.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.540]   Well, someone in the office does.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.900]   Love these two of those.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.820]   But I use--
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.260]   I back up it works really well.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.140]   Doesn't work well.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.300]   It works for backing up your entire--
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.220]   you're just grabbing the whole system.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:40.740]   The whole kit and kit.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.580]   Yeah, you can do partitions and then do a clean backup.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.580]   And it works really well.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.380]   And I even had to restore from it once.
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.100]   And it worked.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:49.580]   The next one--
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.500]   I use Chronosink.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.780]   And it's not free.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.260]   But it works well.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.340]   I use Chronosink for my live brewery.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.300]   When I do my backups on my regular Mac,
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.020]   I leave out, obviously, all the cash stuff,
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.100]   my downloads folder, my iTunes folder.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.940]   And then once a week, I'll run Chronosink
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.700]   to sync up my iTunes with my big ass collection
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.660]   on an external drive.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.620]   And it's so brain dead, easy to use.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.020]   Does anyone use it in View, NVU?
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.140]   This was another one that was--
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.980]   No, it's a HTML editor.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   Look at that a while back.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.140]   It looked pretty cool.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.180]   Is it a little source HTML editor?
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:23.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.820]   That's what it is.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.860]   And it's supposed to be nifty.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.020]   But I don't do any of that stuff.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.460]   So I'm going to--
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.420]   Text Wrangler, dude.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.340]   That's all I need.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.020]   Now, this other one, I don't think Merlin likes it all.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.980]   It's this freeware called Quicksilver.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.060]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.140]   Not a fix.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.180]   How do you pronounce that?
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.540]   So you're--
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.260]   I got to tell you, I love using my mouse.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.540]   I don't see myself doing a lot of stuff with the keyboard.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.780]   It's a quick silver.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.500]   I keep on watching these episodes that you've
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.380]   done for Mac Break.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.460]   And I watch it, and I go, oh, that looks really cool.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.620]   But I'm still scared of it.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.620]   I'm scared of Quicksilver.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:01.700]   I'm getting over it.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:02.220]   I'm getting closer.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   Quicksilver is there to help you.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.780]   Every time I look at watching on the Mac Break episode--
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.260]   I try to avoid organized religion.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:11.620]   And for that reason, Quicksilver doesn't appeal to me.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.420]   It's OK.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.500]   The religion will find you.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.060]   I know.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.560]   I know.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.660]   It keeps haunting me down.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.860]   Oh, no, get away.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.260]   Please, I don't want to use it.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.180]   Working on my first ever screencast right now,
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.420]   which is going to be a demonstration of a combination
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:28.780]   of Kinkless GTD with Quicksilver and 6DExpander.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.460]   And it's how to be an incredibly lazy and productive
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.820]   by combining those three apps together.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.220]   I like that.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.940]   Lazy and productive is very easy.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   And productive.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.740]   Next one on the list, of course, is stuff at Expander.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.020]   Just about all of us have that.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.140]   I mean, I can't imagine not having to--
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.340]   Because we have to.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.940]   But I switched.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.940]   I'm using something else.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.340]   What are you using?
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.620]   I'm using something that I found on the internet.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.820]   And I'm killing time where I would--
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.780]   You found it on the internet?
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.140]   That narrows it right down for us, Merlin.
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:58.820]   What did you find?
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.660]   I asked me treading water while Scott makes fun.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.300]   I heard that you can go up the internet.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.460]   You can download things.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.540]   Which tube are you in, Merlin?
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.380]   It is called the Un-Archiver.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.380]   Un-Archiver.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.140]   And it's an archiver.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.180]   Yes.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.540]   And you can associate your files with that.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:22.020]   And it just feels better than the Expander to me.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.740]   We're so sit-ex.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:25.460]   I don't know.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.860]   I haven't seen one of those in a while.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.180]   I have to admit, my big thing is,
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.660]   I don't understand why when I pass things back and forth
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.140]   to everyone now, I just zip everything.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.220]   Everything to me is a control.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:33.860]   Yeah, I got to zip.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.620]   That's the thing.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.020]   The thing is, is that today, for instance,
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.020]   I'm trying to upload to something to somebody.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.980]   And it came to me as a sit-ex.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.980]   And so I put it up there.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.180]   But if I double click on that-- if I put that into my web page
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.420]   where someone can just click on it and download it,
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.580]   it comes up as garbily go.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.260]   It doesn't get handled well by a browser.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.300]   Now I can fix my browser to figure that out.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.780]   But that's not going to help me on the air side.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.580]   So it's easier for me to just get to zip it,
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.900]   because I know that when they hit it,
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.220]   it's going to come down.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:01.740]   You got to add it.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.860]   I used to try and vzip everything and get a smart ass,
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.780]   just because it was so efficient.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.820]   But you got to zip.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.260]   I think that's becoming standard.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.500]   Yeah, increasingly, people don't have stuff at expander
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.780]   anymore, because Apple doesn't include it with new machines.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.460]   So you have to go to the website.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.420]   You have to give them your email address
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.740]   so they can mail you a password.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.900]   So you can-- I'm happy to use it.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.220]   Just make it easy for me to use.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.380]   I don't want to have to enter stuff,
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.380]   and then retrieve an email message to get it later.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.820]   Next one on the list, text Wrangler 2.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.220]   Yay.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.580]   Well, Chris likes to text Wrangler.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.700]   I like everything that those guys do.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.060]   That's bare-bones, right?
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:37.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.460]   Yeah, they make some good stuff.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.980]   I used to use BB Edit, and I paid for BB Edit.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.700]   But now I use the free text Wrangler,
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.740]   which shows how messed up I am.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.700]   Text Wrangler's a Coco, too, right?
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.780]   I'm not sure.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.860]   Coco Crisp.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.700]   Yeah, it's Coco Crisp.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.900]   Now, what do you guys use it for?
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.660]   I use it for building HTML pages,
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.300]   because I'm one of them old-fashioned coders
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.980]   that likes to start with the blank page.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:00.460]   Wow.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.860]   And I use it for the blogs for Macworld and Playlist.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.540]   We have to have all that stuff formatted for HTML,
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.900]   and it's just as easy as pie.
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:09.980]   There you go.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.660]   Next one on the list is VLC.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.340]   I must have, in my opinion.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.500]   Are you guys using VLC?
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.340]   Pretty much for those--
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.500]   And we should tell them what that is.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:24.020]   What VLC is, is that pretty much anything that isn't--
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.660]   when it's not QuickTime, and QuickTime doesn't want to play it,
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.620]   VLC you're almost guaranteed is going to play.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.860]   It's going to play ABIs.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.260]   It's going to play Divx.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.780]   It's going to play all these different formats.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.820]   And so it's an open source player.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.020]   And it's just something you have to have on your--
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.300]   if you're downloading videos off the web that aren't from YouTube
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:47.380]   and aren't from iTunes, you need to be able to open that--
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.540]   if you need to be able to open that.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.500]   Have you tried Nice Player?
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.900]   I have not tried Nice Player at all.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.740]   Nice Player is another--
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.740]   I haven't played with it that much.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.540]   But the nice thing about VLC, obviously,
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.700]   is it seems it's open source.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.220]   It handles all these different formats,
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.140]   and it kind of honors these different systems.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.980]   And Nice Player is kind of even cooler if you're Alex,
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.340]   and you're going to actually be watching movies on your Mac.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.820]   I think-- I don't know if this is the exact right phrase for it,
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.740]   but it's totally chromeless.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.780]   What comes up is a big black window.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.100]   And when you mouse over, you see the controls.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.860]   And it's very easy to jump right into full screen mode,
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.740]   or what have you.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.740]   It has playlists that flip out as a drawer.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   And it does WMVs, which is kind of cool.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.700]   There you go.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.180]   Well, that's definitely-- probably one to add to this list.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.100]   And then the final one they had was Windows Media Player.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.300]   That shows this is an older list.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:40.940]   Is it an older list?
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:42.460]   This list has been around for a long time,
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.900]   because Windows Media Player no longer is updated.
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.180]   Well, it actually says that Windows--
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.660]   how it said that-- well, they were talking about Flip for Mac
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.540]   now is giving a quick time support.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.740]   Yeah, and this list must have been older.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.540]   I don't know why.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.060]   You know what happened was, is I digged it.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.260]   It came up on Dig, which you never know exactly when it's--
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.060]   oh, this is really old.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.260]   I do want to point out that today,
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:09.060]   Microsoft released version 11 of Windows Media Player for the PC.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.540]   And you know, they are such innovators over there.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.220]   One small problem, just like the Zoom,
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.260]   it has no podcasting support or pod catcher capability.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.500]   But hey, Bill Gates said the internet
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.020]   was a fad when it first came out, so that figures.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.620]   But is it brown?
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.420]   It isn't brown, so it doesn't match
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.180]   the ugliest of the Zunes.
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.980]   But you guys--
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.860]   I just think it's silly that they don't have podcasting support.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.460]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.260]   Well, it's--
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   And by that, I've been hearing you say that.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.660]   And I-- not along here in San Francisco.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.900]   But when you say that, you mean it
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.820]   doesn't have the iTunes-like ability to follow an RSS feed
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.100]   and pull that stuff automatically?
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.500]   Is that what you mean?
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.060]   When you say it doesn't support podcasts,
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.860]   that doesn't mean it won't play MP3s.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.660]   You mean that it doesn't automatically pull them down?
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:53.420]   Is that correct?
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.060]   That's correct.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.100]   It has no pod catcher built in.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:01.140]   And just like the Zune has no capability whatsoever
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.540]   to automatically manage podcasts like the iPod does,
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:09.780]   which is just one of the reason the Zune is D-U-M-E-D.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   Oh, no.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.540]   Not that you have an opinion about the poor limo Zune.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.380]   No.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:21.220]   I'm just-- if there was a way to buy stock in just the Zune,
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.700]   I would sell it short today.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.700]   Jeez.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:30.340]   You're going to turn into like the Jeff Foxworthy of the Zune.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.300]   I mean, I love all these guys that have gone out
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.980]   and got all these domains, like Zune Intelligence
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.740]   and Zune Insider.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.700]   And I'm thinking, you know, there's
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.100]   going to be about 13 people hitting those websites
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.180]   three weeks from now.
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:44.620]   All right.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.180]   Well, I think we've come to the end of the road.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.820]   I know that both Scott needs to go.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.820]   And we're recording here a little earlier than you'll hear it.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:56.500]   And also, Chris, you have Halloween duties.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.020]   I do.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:57.220]   I do.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.260]   It's trick or treat time.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.740]   It's trick or treat time.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.060]   Alex, I don't have anywhere to be at all.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.420]   You and I--
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.740]   If you want to just keep talking.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.660]   Don't just be Merlin and I.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.980]   We're going to go back to talking about something really--
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.020]   we'll find some esoteric.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.180]   I was just going to look at some old photos and weep.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:16.020]   Hey, Chris, are you going to dress up as a PC, Chris?
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:16.820]   No.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.340]   No.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.460]   I don't want to take any attention away from my daughter.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.460]   So she'll be in costume.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.100]   She'll be in costume.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.660]   What's your daughter going to be?
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.900]   She's Tinkerbell.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.220]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.980]   She's five and a half and she's Tinkerbell.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.740]   And it's very cute.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.580]   My son's going out as Indiana Jones.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.780]   I think we even got him a whip.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.780]   Oof.
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:35.900]   You got to start him young.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.380]   Given a nine-year-old boy, a whip is a dangerous thing.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:40.820]   But--
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.020]   Yeah, I have to go downstairs.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:46.300]   We're giving out shuffles to the first 200 kids that come.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.980]   And Scott's address is--
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.620]   I hope somebody on there where Alex is going
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.860]   gives up eye insurance.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.660]   How the whip hurts.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.620]   All right.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.700]   So thanks, Chris.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.220]   Once again, if you want to read a little bit more
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.260]   on what Chris is working on, go to Macworld.com.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.220]   Is that the best place to go?
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.100]   Are we going to do our favorite apps?
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:06.860]   What?
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:07.820]   We're not going to do our favorite apps.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.940]   Oh, I forgot the favorite apps.
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.500]   What's your favorite app, Merlin?
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.060]   Well, that's OK.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:12.860]   We don't have to.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.100]   No, we don't want to mess up the whole thing here.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.100]   We were getting to the end of it.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.660]   Well, like you, Alex, I am a lazy man.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.180]   And I get most of my ideas for stories for the show from Dig.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.340]   And I found this off of a really cool article
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.180]   that I probably won't be able to find immediately.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.820]   But it's basically-- I found that there's
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.260]   a swell article out there about how
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.940]   to prepare your Mac for the possibility
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:32.900]   that it might be stolen.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.340]   I know it's a bunch of great little tips
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:37.020]   for hardening your security and installing some security
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.020]   software for making easier to find.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.900]   And one of my favorite finds in that--
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.620]   this is one of those great little Mac applications.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:46.300]   It just does one dumb little thing, but it's so handy.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.660]   It's called Free DMG.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.180]   And it's available at kellycomputing.net--
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.140]   K-E-L-L-E-Y computing one word.net.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.860]   And Free DMG, you can throw it down in your doc.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.500]   And basically, you can grab anything--
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.260]   your files, folders, whatever--
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.820]   drop it onto Free DMG.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.860]   And based on--
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.340]   don't yell at me before you hear this, Scott.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.340]   So based on your settings, it will
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.380]   on the fly make a DMG for you.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.780]   And the way that this differs from the typical DMG way
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.220]   is you can set this up to automatically encrypt.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.100]   In my case, it automatically encrypts.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.700]   And it automatically makes it a sparse image.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:23.100]   So it's just a super fast way to get in the habit of encrypting
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.300]   your stuff and making it real easy and portable.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.100]   And it's free.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.020]   Oh, sorry.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.060]   Are we done?
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.980]   Scott, Scott.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.260]   You don't have to open up disk utility.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.260]   OK.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.060]   And so it's kind of handy and fast.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.980]   Scott, do you have a favorite you'd like to show us?
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.300]   Well, keep in mind our tradition here
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:45.020]   is to give either a favorite site or product or a tip.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.500]   And I'm going to do a tip this week.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.500]   Yes.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.000]   Good.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.060]   And my tip is one that probably everybody--
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.420]   I think this is some super secret tip.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.820]   But since I only found it yesterday, it's new to me.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.380]   Chances are if I found it yesterday,
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.580]   somebody else doesn't know it.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:05.580]   So everybody knows how to do a screen capture from their Mac.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.460]   You don't want to do that, right, Chris?
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:08.900]   Absolutely.
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.260]   OK.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.100]   So you want to tell everybody how to do that?
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.540]   Screen capture from your Mac?
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.180]   You push the button.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.440]   Yeah, you push the button.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.000]   Option, Command, Shift, 3.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.520]   You push F13 because you've mapped it with Snap's Pro.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.200]   That's correct.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:31.600]   Well, you do have the ability to take a quick screen
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.640]   capture from the OS.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.040]   But there's a way to do something that doesn't
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.160]   create a screen capture and save the file to your disk.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.800]   If you hold Control, Command, Shift, 3,
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.240]   then instead of taking that screen capture
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.580]   and making it into a file, you put it into your clipboard,
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.780]   which you can then paste into any old application.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.340]   So that's my tip of the week.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.220]   Control, Command, Shift, 3.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.940]   We'll do a screen capture and put that puppy right
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:00.980]   into the clipboard for you.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.020]   As good as Control, Command, Shift, 4.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.300]   Let you do the Select.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.380]   Because Command, Shift, 4.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:05.900]   I bet it does.
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:08.420]   Let you select a certain area and make a model.
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:09.660]   You didn't let me finish.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.780]   I was just about to say.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.740]   And if you want to add Control, Command, Shift, 4,
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.000]   you get the little cursor to do the select.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.100]   Very tasty.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.000]   Chris, do you have anything to share with us?
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.500]   I do.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.360]   I'm going to share the website, Rogamiba.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.840]   And we've talked about some audio hijacking stuff they do.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.400]   But they do so much great stuff.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.640]   They've got a new application now called Fission.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.860]   And it is a little audio editor.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:37.100]   And what I use it for is if you've recorded an LP
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.180]   or a cassette into your Mac or you have recorded streaming
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.380]   audio of some kind, it's difficult to parse
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.540]   that stuff up by hand.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.940]   I mean, you can look through the waveform and do it.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:48.980]   But Fission has a really nice way.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.020]   You can put this long file in like the side of an LP.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.900]   And it's very smart.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:57.060]   So it looks for drops in the audio level as well as blank spots.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.580]   And it will automatically chop this thing
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.700]   into separate tracks, which you can then export to iTunes.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.060]   So it's a really easy way to chuck up audio files.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.140]   And it's great interface.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.180]   It's just as simple as can be.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.540]   That's awesome.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:17.740]   My mind for this time is going to be I-Stop Motion.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.620]   Have you guys used I-Stop Motion at all?
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.460]   No, do tell.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.380]   Oh, OK.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.700]   So this is made by Boinks Software.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.860]   But it's just I-StopMotion.com.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.860]   And what it does is you can hook up a DB camera
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:35.180]   to your computer, or you can just use your I-site.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.540]   And you can do Stop Motion.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.580]   So it's basically a screen grab.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.820]   It's not even skinning.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.260]   It does onion skinning.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.620]   So you can really just see where your object was
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.420]   and where it's going.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.460]   And you can really build your own little Wallace and Grumman.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:55.500]   And my kids, I have to say, are freakishly obsessed
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.660]   with I-Stop Motion.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.060]   I mean, they spend weeks-- literally,
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.020]   they'll spend weeks working on these animations.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.700]   And that lasts 2 and 1/2 or 3 minutes.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.580]   But 2 and 1/2 or 3 minutes with doing Stop Motion
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.740]   is quite a thing.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.660]   And it's got a lot of--
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.100]   you can play it back.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.660]   You can keep on playing it back.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.180]   You can loop it.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.660]   You can look at your onion skinning.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.460]   And then you can just export a quick time movie out.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.300]   And it just does-- it's a very Mac program.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.740]   I don't think it's available on a PC.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.500]   So it really is this kind of--
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.700]   everything is really designed with the Mac aesthetic.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.660]   And it's really--
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.500]   anyway, I would highly suggest that they've
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.020]   got a free demo that you can download and you can play.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.140]   And it's definitely worth--
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.860]   it's just a lot of fun.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.580]   So that's going to be my little tip for the day.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.420]   Cool.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:50.900]   So anyway, now back to the close cycle.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.100]   Chris Breen, Macworld.com.
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.980]   It's probably the easiest playlist.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.060]   And is there another one?
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.220]   There's Macworld playlist.
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.820]   Macworldplaylistmag.com.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.740]   OK, there you go.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:06.340]   And Scott Born, the iLiveZone, which is now part of the--
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.260]   it's really up there now.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.620]   We've been talking about a bean up there.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.380]   But iLiveZone is now part of the Twit Network.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.220]   So we've got-- you can go right to Twit.tv to download that.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.060]   But it's also iLiveZone.com.
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.540]   Is that still there, Scott?
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.380]   That's going to be there for a couple of more months.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:24.220]   And in fact, tomorrow we will have episode number 14
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.820]   of the iLiveZone at Twit.tv and at iLiveZone.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.940]   I also want to mention my newest blog, which
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.420]   is called PodcastGearGuy.com.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.460]   And I do nothing but review podcasting gear there.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.540]   So check that one out as well.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.140]   And Merlin Mann from 43 Folders.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.500]   Thanks so much for stopping in again, Merlin.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.300]   Alex, it's always a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.900]   Aw, thanks.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.860]   That's so sweet.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.580]   Anyway, I am Alex Lindsay, I guess.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.460]   That's my name.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.100]   And I don't know where I really live.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.540]   I have to--
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.300]   Hey, hey, Alex.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.460]   What do you have to pin?
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.580]   I don't have anything to pin.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.540]   This is Alex Lindsay.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:06.940]   And I'd like to have you listen to Mac break weekly.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.140]   That's my shot.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.540]   I don't think you never have before.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.660]   We call that a programming note.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.580]   Now, if you want to see more of what I do,
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.420]   you can go to pixacore.com.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:22.780]   We train, organize, and prepare people
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.220]   for digital media production.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.580]   So anyway, that's what I do.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.940]   And thanks so much for coming.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.100]   And I guess we'll see you all next week.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.100]   Bye.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.940]   So long suckers.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.540]   Yeah, we forgot to do the windows suck, so long suckers.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.940]   That did not go away.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.500]   Yeah, that are going to--
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.860]   Our three-way sign off did not go well.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.620]   Chris, we need it.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.140]   We need somebody intelligent like you
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.140]   to help us come up with the real sign off.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.300]   Yeah, we need a real sign off.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.460]   We don't have one for this.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.300]   Yeah, Chris.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:51.820]   Really?
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.180]   Yes, we're going to be here.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:57.140]   So f-- off.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.700]   And thank you for another week of Mac break weekly.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.700]   We end up--
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.700]   [BLEEP]
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.180]   We are not going to go here, fellows.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.300]   Yeah, I guess I should stop recording.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.660]   If you like Mac break weekly, don't miss this week in media
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.820]   a weekly rundown of all things media with industry experts.
