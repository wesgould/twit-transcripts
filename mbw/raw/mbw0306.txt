[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.400]   polishes the apple so to speak
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.960]   Here he is number one apple polisher. I don't know who to say number which of you is number one apple polisher
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.040]   Alex andy leo i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't think Andy because as a professionally trained journalist would want that mantle
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.920]   Exactly i'm i'm independent i am unaffiliated i don't want my own personal purchases to impinge in any way
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400]   The perception of my fair
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.800]   journalistic sense of balance on the other hand he does love squirrels apparently
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.320]   Yeah squirrels a groundhog he loves groundhogs like squirrels love nuts
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.880]   It's one of it's one of the staff backyard groundhogs the mid the senior staff
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   uh
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.800]   This groundhog there's also a junior groundhog and one that is
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.960]   Probably pushing retirement age i was very very glad to see him two months ago because that meant that he had actually survived the winter
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   which i didn't think it was but
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.400]   Do uh, do you think of them as your minions?
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.520]   No again, they're just they're their staff
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.000]   Okay, they they tend the grounds i don't i don't really have to spend much time in the yard
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.440]   Because if there's anything edible in there they will have already eaten it so i don't have to whenever i need a snack
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.880]   I know that can pretty much keep it to the kitchen because there's not gonna be anything in the backyard
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.480]   You took a lovely picture i saw a yesterday after the thunderstorms of a wet rabbit
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.800]   in your backyard
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   Yeah, that was that was uh
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.200]   Have it yeah here it is i love that picture just standing there. Yeah, that's what that sony telephoto you're reviewing right now
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.880]   Yeah, it's been delayed a couple times. This is like the new uh, any xf3
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.640]   And sony sent that really cool like immensely ridiculous
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.760]   Like huge lens on a tiny body with it
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.720]   Uh, but the but the cool thing about both those photos is that like i'm taking them through screen doors
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.360]   So there's a reason like you know how like barber strizan is really vayner about about her appearance and every time she directs herself in a movie
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.640]   Like there's always this layer of like black mesh or cheesecloth in front of the lens to make her look like more ethereal
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.120]   So basically that that bunny in that ground hug are both getting the barber strizan like a thirial screen shot
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.880]   We like to call that promist just throw a little promist on there and he in aco from the chicago
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.520]   Senn times is here. Alex lindsey oddly enough is in town crazy in four
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.640]   He's here. I you know like once in a while nowadays. I'm working. Is he working? He's got a good job
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.160]   I'm not knocking it. You got a business. You're running it. But i'm working thrilled when you're here
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.760]   It's nice. I love being here. I'm sorry
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.160]   I want to thank rick. We have a couple of people to talk about today one shawn mcgumery who is watching us
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.520]   At the beach on his phone and send us this picture
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.080]   curse you shawn Montgomery
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.800]   Looks like a nice day. It looks like a corona ad
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.680]   Where shawn is I think everybody should start sending us photos of where they are while they're listening to our shawn
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.720]   And we'll show that and then and then rick wind links
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.480]   It was fishing in Oregon and took I think a very lovely photo of a sunset
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.240]   But look look a little look a little closer. You know, I think about that that sun
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.760]   Look a little bit like an apple
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.640]   No
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   I don't know rick. I okay
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.600]   Did you get chills when
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680]   If you put the heads piece to the staff of jobs in the right place in the map room
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.960]   A glowing apple will tell you where the iphone five is hidden
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's actually the source of all of their innovations actually this just in apple is now suing the sun
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.960]   For stealing its trade design
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.080]   That's that is an amazing picture rick. Thank you for sending it to i left a steam coming off the water too. It's gorgeous
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   Wow
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.280]   Anyway, so picture time is over, but we just thought yes
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.920]   Dwayne ignite in the chat room says thank you for being a nerd Andy
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.680]   You know it's
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.880]   I was I was listening to the judge john hodgman podcast and he made a really nicely
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.760]   nerdy iron man reference and
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.440]   Without even missing a beat i'm thinking oh was that that must have been from the bob late and david michalini era of iron man
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.760]   The story line. I don't remember the story arc he's referring by believe it was a bob late initiative. Oh
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.120]   Yeah, it's it's reflex you guys is nice now we that we love our nerds. That's what this whole channel is built for
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.040]   nerds
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.280]   You might as well we could just consider to what we should call nerds
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.000]   Like why didn't I do that we could come up with some retro nim that's where you have an acronym and you go backwards and you give it a meaning
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.720]   A retro nim yes, we could do that
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.920]   Nords chatroom work on it angry nerds angry
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.960]   There is a game right there right there is a candy we'd have to spell it differently
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.840]   And green nerds angry nerds. Yeah, so uh apple has this now i i'm
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.920]   Was a little head up over this but i'm going to give you guys a chance to defend apple over this a california district judge
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.560]   on friday granted apple
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.960]   And in junction against the samson galaxy nexus. This is the most recent
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.520]   Google experience phone
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.720]   Which makes it significant by the way it is not and i'm sure this is why apple picked this as a target
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.320]   It is not modified in any way by carriers. This is the google
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.080]   Experience or by manufacturers. It's also the first phone running ice cream sandwich
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.520]   The judge found that it likely infringes on all four patents cited by kupertino
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.200]   Uh and and uh, but
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.440]   The judge specifically singled out uh 604 which is called the syri patent
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.400]   There was slide to unlock
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.720]   Uh, what florian mueller calls data tapping and i still don't understand what it does
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:03.800]   And uh, basically autocorrect where it suggests responses, but the but judge co said the one she was most
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.320]   convinced by
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.480]   Is the is the patent that says when you do a search
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   Go out look at a lot of different sources and put the results back into a single unified page
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.080]   For the user. That's the syri patent and of course
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.040]   Uh, I don't know exactly i'm not looked at the complaint, but exactly where in the nexus phone they're talking about
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.440]   But I would guess it's the google voice search feature, which is very much like syri where you'll
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.280]   Search for something and I presume it brings back Yelp and location and other stuff. What do you think? Andy
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.160]   This is this is all pretty gross. Uh, when you look at the actual patents that are being actioned on
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.760]   They're so broad that half of two of these things
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   I can tell you that i've actually written in code myself
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.480]   And anytime in the past 20 years because they're just that basic
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.800]   uh, if they're the uh, the the thing that you're confused about is something that I think on apple
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.280]   It's actually called data detectors. This is the the data tapping thing data tapping
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.400]   It's it's essentially the idea that if someone sends you an email that says oh, that's cool
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.120]   I'll be in town if you need to get in touch with me. Here's my phone number
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.600]   That's the ability to detect that sequence right?
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.640]   That's the to turn that into you tap that and turns into uh into an actual voice call
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   But I mean is this is that really so complicated that it is apple soul property
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.800]   The the patent for syri now when I the first time that I I was uh, I was looking at the these problems
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.400]   Um, i'm trying to get activated here. Here is here is like the samson galaxy three
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.680]   Version of syri and as you can see it looks almost identical. Yeah, what is that part of the problem?
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.040]   No, no, no, that's not where the patent is not the problem in the patent the patent is yeah
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.800]   See here it is as I was talking it said, I'm sorry. I don't understand
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.960]   What is the real deep?
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.600]   Do you want to search the web? It is really exactly like syri
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.160]   But that's not the that's not the nature of their complaint the nature their complaint is that
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.640]   the fritt the
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.280]   Transmogrification of the phrase what's the weather like out there to a search of a weather page
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.840]   on the internet and then
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.000]   a search a search of
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.760]   It's syri here. I could do it here. Let me try. Let me try. No. No Chad. Do you have an over the shoulder for me?
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.440]   No, uh, no, it's the what's the weather like out there? I'm just a nature of the happen
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.280]   Unfortunately, I put I placed the phone down on the
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.760]   Down the on the macbook that I use like to control the chat and so it's oh, I see a magnet. I bet the lid is closed
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.160]   I'm gonna try to go to sleep now
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.680]   More apple innovation. I don't think it's probably a magnet
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.680]   So it did I just did that though. I said what's the weather out there and uh, this is the samsung version
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.920]   This is not google voice. This is a samsung version
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.120]   Now the next is to something similar with ice cream sandwich and then it gave me the weather for a very nice presentation
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   Uh, oh you've mute it now. I don't know what magnet you've got there, but you've now muted yourself. I'm taking it off now
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   Okay
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   Sorry about that. Um
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.040]   I hate when that happens, you know, you get everything set up just right and then
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.040]   I
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.320]   I'm actually a few weeks away from like actually it's been like a couple of years since I set up the studio
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.560]   I'm now a few weeks away from
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.320]   Truly like moving everything out and rebuilding everything like so it makes sense now
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.120]   And I think that just told me that i'm gonna have to put like something over this keyboard to keep myself from doing that
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.560]   Um, but do you get to get back to get back to the point
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:35.080]   They're patent on that they're using for this is just the idea of saying what's the weather and turning that into a search result specifically for weather
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.120]   That returns search results and that's another thing that
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.840]   Anybody could tell you that they've written code like that in the past 20 25 years
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.800]   It's just absolutely silly and it's just so broad that believe it or not
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   I mean apple also tried to get injunction against this the scalloccy three a galaxy s3 from from samsung
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.160]   Uh, and the reason why the judge turned that down wasn't because uh, it was only because that apple had asked made so many requests of that
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.920]   Judge that she just didn't have time on the honor docket for it. So right now
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.680]   This is a very popular phone that a lot of people are very very happy with and are saying that
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.040]   Myself including that this is pretty much as good as an iphone
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.720]   It's just different strengths and different weaknesses
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.480]   This would not be on the market if not for the fact that uh, there just wasn't time nowhere for for apple to block it
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.800]   And it just makes it just gets me
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.640]   Really disappointed because that was thinking about this this morning that
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.480]   This is not the act of a greater nation
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.760]   This is the act of a lesser nation. This is the act of a nation of a society in decline
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.360]   I'm not saying that this is a sign that apple's going down and i'm predicting apple's going down
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.400]   I'm simply saying that when you look at the things that make you
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.120]   Think that a company has it all together
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:51.560]   Suing other companies into not making competing products based on what appear to be very flimsy excuses is not that thing
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.360]   And I had to come back to
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   I'll cut myself off after this because this is clearly a two-hour rant. I don't want that to happen
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.680]   But I had to keep thinking about uh, what luis ck the comedian
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.080]   Would say a couple years ago when so many people were trying to claim that oh this comedian is stealing luis ck's bit
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   Here's another comedian that's let stealing another one of his bits
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.000]   And he wasn't pleased that other comedians might have been using his material
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.640]   But his larger attitude is that well by the time they steal the bit that I was I was worked on two years ago and
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.880]   Performed on dvd last year. I've developed another two years worth of material
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.360]   So it doesn't really bother me or affect me all that much
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.640]   I mean if someone does a complete knockoff of syria the way that this samsung galaxy 3 did
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.680]   I think that's an issue, but man if you're going to say that you're not allowed to have to pop out
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.120]   A phone number from an email and turn that into a phone call
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.640]   And that's the reason why you're going to deny a very cool useful alternative device to an entire market
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.720]   That's just not that's not something that apple should be proud of and that's not something that any apple users should be proud of either
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.760]   You know just to use your analogy of the of the comic it almost feels I can understand why a comic would sue if the joke
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.160]   We're told by someone else has his own, but it's almost as if a comic said I
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.440]   Patent all airline peanut jokes. You cannot make jokes about airline peanuts
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.320]   It's it's a much broader thing than a and it strikes me as being overly broad now
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.240]   I should mention that uh samsung has requested a stay
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:27.400]   So this you know, this is still in process the the injunction which would prevent sales of galaxy nexus phones in the us
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.240]   Requires a couple of things apple has to post a $96 million bond in case the injunction
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.960]   Was inappropriate and there's damages to sam song. This is to protect sam song sam song has appealed in
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.440]   We're actually requested a stay
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.280]   And so until the stay has been ruled upon apple is not going to put up the bond
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.160]   So it's in other words, you could still buy a nexus phone
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.120]   Just just to give you an update on what's going on right now. What do you think Alex?
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.640]   Well, I think that um
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.680]   A few things. I mean I think that the fundamental problem is the patent office
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.800]   So the you know, so I think we know we know we know but when i'm bad, it's you're broken
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.760]   But the thing is is that is that the way it's set up right now is that if you do not patent
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.240]   Uh everything that you're doing some troll is going to come and sue you for it
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.960]   And if you do not patent it and adjudicate
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.280]   I mean if you don't take it to court if you don't take the court everyone who's you will lose the access to that
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.040]   Is that the case, you know, that is I believe it's I know it's a case with trademark
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.960]   I don't know if it's the case with pat. I do believe that you have to continue to um
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.840]   Do we have attorneys in the chatroom if you could fill us in on that
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.680]   But I believe that they have to go down that path beyond that I think that I think that google very much underestimated
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:44.280]   I think a how how close steve was to like really being excited about working with google and how upset he was when
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.400]   When they when they released something that was directly competitive with something that to what he was really
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:55.000]   Like everything that he was about, you know, and and the issue is is that is that this is you know
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.680]   This argument is not it's not a business argument. It is a
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.720]   Uh
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   The the issue that you get into is
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:10.920]   Is this personal, you know, and I think it's going to remain personal and I think that I think that I think apple is going to continue to go down this path
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.040]   Um, I don't I don't think it's a business decision. I don't think it's trying to make more money
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.120]   I think it it literally is
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.640]   um
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.840]   You know they were crossed and I think that the apple may slowly tie away
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.440]   But this is all legacy stuff from when steve was upset and I don't think apple's just going to drop all of that all all of the sudden
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.000]   Um, I do think that one of the things that apple I think has a complaint about whether you know
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.920]   There's all these little technical things that are going on but overall what you're looking at is sam-sung releasing phones that
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.480]   Many pieces of them look exactly like what apple's doing so apple comes out with something in there
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.840]   And they really do look just like that and it's like yeah
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.680]   We can give you you know, we can't give you an iphone
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.520]   But we can give you something that is almost as good as an iphone and it does feel like
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.600]   A lot of these phones feel like a lot of the features that they're talking about feel like well, you know, we're getting something almost as good
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.520]   You know, it's it's actually I think that one I don't I would I might ascribe and I don't know and I you know
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.560]   I think it's completely possible that you could say apple is doing what they have to do as you say to protect their patent
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.640]   Uh, and you could even make the case well apple is right that this is an infringement
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.320]   I think you could also make the case that this phone. This is not the galaxy. Nestis. This is actually a better phone
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.360]   The s3 that's the one you have to Andy is superior in almost every respect to the iphone
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.280]   I mean, I certainly feel that well, I'm carrying on phone. I wouldn't call it superior
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.880]   I would say that it's just as good just in different ways. Well, we won't get to that
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.080]   Yeah, we don't need to debate it. I'm just my point is some might say it's superior
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.120]   I do some might say it's almost it's as good or equal some might not like it
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.600]   But I think that what's happened is then this is going this is already selling quite well is that
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:50.680]   You could also I'm not saying this but you could make the case that apples starting to be nervous about the competition post by google
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.760]   And android phones
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:58.680]   And that's why they're pursuing why I definitely think that there I do believe that it is an apple's dna to worry about
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.000]   Someone else coming in with another operating system and taking something that they had very popular
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   I mean that is their history apples history is that they you know, they created a system. It was copied
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.680]   Essentially and then run over them, you know, you know, and and that happened, you know before and they're not gonna
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.760]   I think that they're not going to give any
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.200]   They're gonna take they're gonna take for their legal request. I really do want to confront one thing
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.080]   I don't believe that in any way. This is a copy of an iphone
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.440]   It's has exactly like it has it has so many features that are unique to this device
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.800]   This is why I keep saying that it's as good as an iphone
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.760]   But it has different strengths. There's probably serie. I think
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.080]   I have to I have to call this serie
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.320]   I think serie is the only thing I can see on this device which I can say yeah
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.120]   That was copied from the iron on that is a sad deal and the judge agrees with you else everything else
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.760]   I think you everything else I think is unique to this device. This is not a copy of the iphone
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.640]   But the judge agrees with you. That's exactly what the judge said is that is that serie is a copy of what what already exists there
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.720]   And so that's that's the issue. That's what the god
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:05.080]   They could have walked away from that wasn't that wasn't that wasn't the issue because they didn't say that the the version of voice command search
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.320]   That was articulated on this device is what is the point of contention? It was it is right?
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.360]   No, I'm saying I'm what I'm I'm sorry
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.160]   I'm speaking specifically of the mess case by which it works
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.840]   The way that the way that it works on this specific device the way it looks in the specific device which was clearly copied
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.240]   I mean it was it you could easily
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.640]   Lance at this phone with the voice command in operation and think that you're looking at an iphone. I think my point is there's certain
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.360]   Sensible ways to do this that somebody even in a vacuum
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:40.120]   Would for instance you making a touchscreen phone would make it the screen be this aspect ratio
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.280]   Even in a vacuum now you might argue this would put a button here
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.840]   This is a lot like an iphone with a button there
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.760]   And I understand with this is not the phone that's being litigated. It's the nexus, but
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.640]   One thing we have to remember this. I think that there is a point to be made. It's like apple
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.200]   patenting rounded rectangles that
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.680]   Which they haven't but that there are a certain sensible kind of almost
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.360]   uh aristatelian, but I think I think that i think that
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:13.160]   A perfection and apple is in effect saying we're gonna do it this remember this happened with the ipad
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.640]   They said well you can make an ipad as long as it's not this looks like that
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.800]   Okay, but we own the platonic ideal of ipad but one one thing we have to remember
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.720]   One thing we have to remember is no phone existed like that until the iphone came out
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.160]   No, that's not true. So i'm saying even had a phone exactly the same, but they had people so they had flip out keyboards
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:37.560]   No for all the time i remember seeing a few years before that there were palm devices that looked like that there were windows
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.080]   windows
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.120]   Pocket pc devices that looked exactly like that. They're the apple didn't want invent the concept
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.120]   Popular because they didn't really call a screen with no buttons underneath
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.520]   They just didn't really work. I guess that was the problem before no they were they were really popular palm was
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.960]   Palm was a huge huge huge. Leo's gonna show me up here
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.640]   Again, I can I can go into my I was almost about to go into my own my office life two doors down
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.040]   And grab a couple of different devices in there
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.800]   But so what i'll say is that yeah, this is starting to go that direction
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.560]   Just lots of little buttons all over the idea is moving everything to the screen except for one
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.320]   You know one singular piece. Yeah, that could have been a much more you could approve on this
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:21.880]   But you cannot say that apple invented this touch screen with an on-screen keyboard with a home button
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.280]   No, we we do need it. I mean, I don't feel
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:30.040]   Are not physical on samsung's phone, but they are there these back button and the home button
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.720]   Right, and we had and we had the newton and we had a lot of other things. I mean, this is a palm
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:40.040]   I should mention for those not watching this is a palm so cute life drive was a five megabyte hard drive in here
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.440]   I can't charge it because I can't fit set a proprietary charger. I think I had that proprietary charger if you could find it
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.200]   I would be very happy the trio, but this predates the iPhone by a good number of years
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.280]   I mean this is not so I guess I would say that everything was so clunky before
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.640]   There it is. I admit I admit apple is done at better and more beautifully right
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:05.000]   So but but that gives you rights for then on that only apple can make such a thing no I I don't I I don't I think that the
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.640]   I think that the issue though is when people have these complaints about all of these things, you know
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   We should be really thinking about how to
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.440]   Rebuild the entire way that we look at pet the patent I agree because everybody is completely broken
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.600]   There's no I don't think that in the world who thinks that software patents make any sense and I think
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.680]   We understand this needs to change
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   But that's where I mean that's where this the fundamental issue that we're going to run into over and over and over again
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.200]   You can't blame apple because they're just doing what the law says you have to do
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.840]   No, I'm not saying that I'm saying that I'm saying that that I think the reason apple's doing this and I have to admit
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.800]   I'm not one that which is clearly so by the way google's doing this in the opposite direction
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.000]   You understand motor roller has gone after apple. So I mean this this goes both ways
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.040]   In that sense, you're absolutely right. This is all this battling
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:54.520]   All this battling and billions of dollars being spent and us being jerked around is because our entire patent system is broken our entire copyright system
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.200]   I want to go I want to go rob the king on this and just say let's get along
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.640]   And each of you make the best thing you can and let the market decide this is an election year
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.320]   We need to be thinking about we need to be thinking about who our representatives are that have have a brain
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.320]   You know when it comes to dealing with this because most of them are bought by
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.840]   By the copyright holders and by the people who want to keep the status quo and they want to keep you know having these pieces
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.680]   And so, you know, you want to be if you're if you really want this to change
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.360]   You're not going to change it by complaining to apple you're not going to change but by boycotting the iphone
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.160]   You're not going to change it by doing those things. You're going to change it by voting in people
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.760]   Who are going to allow this to be moved forward?
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.000]   You know move the conversation forward it won't happen in one election
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.200]   but that's the only way any of this is going to change and I think that
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.520]   You know, I think that apple I definitely think that apple is doing this again because
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.600]   You know, they saw google as a partner. They they felt like they were wronged
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.240]   You know, and I have to admit that
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.640]   um, so some of this is spite or
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.160]   And some of it is legitimate
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:01.800]   And the thing is is that I have to admit that my personality is mostly that I I'm very very loyal until until I get turned upside down
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   And then i'm not so loyal. What would you say?
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.640]   If I had the money if I had the money and someone did what the rule did I can't say that I wouldn't
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.280]   Say well, we're just going to keep our lawyers on it. We'll just see how it goes
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.360]   You know, you know, like, you know, like, I have to admit that my personality would be very similar
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.880]   So I understand the situation is if I felt like I had built this partnership
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.520]   I put their apps in my in my in my you know, I put their apps into my phone
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.040]   I had put their search into my phone. I had done all these things to promote them
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.760]   I pushed all those things forward and then they created their own phone
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.320]   I'd be upset
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.440]   You know, and I probably if I had the money I just turned you know, I'd say well
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.360]   Let's spend $10 million of legal fees a year and just see where it's true. It's a it's a pittance
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.760]   But I have to that, you know, just it's just I have to point out the cost of this patent system. This is a study
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.320]   Uh that came out just recently
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:54.680]   patent trolls cost the economy indirect costs 29 billion dollars a year large companies spend 7.27 million patrol lawsuit
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.000]   So this is this is not apple. This is not google. These are these patent trolls
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.920]   And this is but the thing is is we we have to redefine how we're handling
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.600]   We're about to go into an economy over the next century that intellectual property is the most important thing
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.800]   It's more important than than commercial property or or you know, any kind of your house or anything else
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.400]   Oh, you know, this is a time with you that there is no such thing as intellectual property
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.320]   Well, we gotta figure out a lot of it about that, but we have lately it's not physical property
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.760]   That's a big distinction that needs to be made it. Well, we and we need to make it the thing
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.040]   Is that we need a you know, this is because the thing is is that we are
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.520]   The amount of damage it does to our culture beyond all the 20 29 billion dollars
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.480]   The fact that there are many movies that none of us can ever find or see or you know
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.320]   All the orphan works and all the other pieces this whole system is just completely
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.120]   I agree with you know needs to be turned inside out and upside down and just re not tweaked
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:50.920]   But thrown out and rewritten. Yeah, you know and and we need to start thinking about it in election years of how do we move that forward? Yep
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.320]   You agree any that seems like a statesman like statement
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.440]   Yeah, I I agree the patent system is screwed up
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.760]   But just because it's legal to do something that is pretty horrible
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.600]   Doesn't mean that you have a right or an obligate. Excuse me. It doesn't mean you have a right to do it
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.440]   You know it doesn't mean you have an obligation to do it
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.840]   I think that if apples intention were anything other than to kill products that are competitive with their products
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.480]   They would have found a different solution that that stopped just short of saying we want to ban this
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.640]   We want an injunction to say that you cannot sell these devices in the united states of america
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.680]   They could have said something saying that we want to we will let you so we we're not going to ban the sale
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.800]   But we are going to pursue ongoing litigation that says here's how much the that at some point
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   You're going to have to come to us with some money
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.480]   Uh for the licensing the patents that we own and it could be anything of any value
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:45.240]   But they didn't have to simply say you're not allowed to sell any device in this country that we feel
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.880]   Infringes on our patents and if they're going to if they're going to pick a device to do that with
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:57.640]   Oh boy. Why do they pick something that is super popular is being praised by pretty much everybody and has so
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.880]   Little similarity to anything that apples selling. I don't think apples intention is to it's a knockdown things that are competitive with their
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.480]   They're apo. I think their intention is to knock down google's version of that
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.040]   You know apple tried to keep the swimsuit
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.000]   Galaxy three out of the west they the judge this is the case where the judge same judge judge co said
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.640]   Well, I can I could I could start working on this but then you're gonna have to backseat your other stuff
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.360]   So apple said no, we'll go off to the nexus. You can stop this later. They stopped the galaxy 10
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.120]   That's an injunction. You can't buy that
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.360]   I'm saying we're not going after consistently one by one after the number one
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.280]   Smartphone manufacturer after apple and what just samson their target is not sam's saying their target is google
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.560]   If you're samson you might feel a little bit of a bullseye in your bag
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.600]   Do you think that they're gonna go after people using windows eight phones
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.480]   First for lawsuits. I don't think so no
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.720]   Not not just because it's not competitive or not competitive. They're not they're not the thing is is that microsoft didn't pick that fight with them
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.600]   You know, I mean didn't well all didn't turn that over apple. This is I still think this is between app
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.640]   This is between apple and google and android and there have you unlock a windows phone you slide don't yeah, they're not gonna
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.880]   I don't think they're gonna have to how do you is there a click? I should look at my windows phone
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:13.720]   Uh, Alex is there Alex gumple. Do you is he over there when you see an email in a windows phone and there's a email address or a phone number or website
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.320]   Can you click it?
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:21.800]   I wonder yeah, but I don't think I think that the issue is is that this is this is between apple and google over android and samson is just
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.560]   In the middle, you know, you know, they're you know, they're holding a hot stick pick one
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:31.400]   I think you could say it's against samson and google it's it's but I think it's against everybody using the android operating system
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.120]   I mean, I think that's the you know, and I think apple is is folk is very focused on that
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.440]   You know, and I think it's very hard to defend apple
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:47.000]   I'm not i'm not i'm not it's conjure it's conjecture and you might you might very well be right that it is a personal thing between apple and and android
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.960]   But at the same it's unfortunately android is inseparable from the success of android that if apple field is google
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.720]   If apple feels any pressure from any other mobile manufacturer, it's certainly not windows phone at this point
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.960]   Uh that so I think that I think that what's going to happen is if we see two years from now that windows phone has like a 25
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.480]   percent market share uh and microsoft surface has like a
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:17.320]   28 percent market share maybe apple will suddenly see you know what this this thing of an on we we have a patanon method by which
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.280]   Fingarpresses are translated into askey characters
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.360]   via glass device or mechanical device interface via radio or mechanical contrivance
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.240]   Yeah, you know what you're not a lot you can you can sell the surface here as long as there's not a keyboard or no way to keep
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.880]   Or any way to hook up a keyboard and you can allow people to actually touch the the surface of the screen
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.000]   We'll see if that happens. We'll see yeah
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.680]   I mean I I as I said, I think that I think that what we're seeing right now is something that while I
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.800]   I don't know whether it's good or bad, but I definitely um
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.360]   Uh
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.920]   I can't say that I wouldn't do it in the same position
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.640]   You know just because oh you're so good at sob but i'm not I'm not that competitive
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.880]   Do you like to win? No, but i'm not that competitive with those types of things when i'm in a i'm like
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.120]   We teach a lot of other people how to do what we do
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.520]   We do a lot of other things that that doesn't bother me, but what bothers me is me feeling like I got
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.480]   Throwing a little I you know, and if I get thrown on a dog talking about because I'm I'm I'm you know
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.040]   I see myself as you know, we tend to be very very loyal to people around us, you know and
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.280]   And if we feel like we got thrown under the bus, then you know, we take it personally
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.080]   Yeah, and so I think that I and I think apple was doing a lot with you you are I have to resist that uh though
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.760]   But the but what i'm saying is is that is that it's atleachia live that kind of resentment
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.360]   You know, I swear to god. It all takes time. It's better to just relax to chill
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.720]   Yeah, so anyways, that's worked some some more on these iphone thing. We're gonna make the iphone five really really good
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:46.760]   Let's talk about the iphone five and Alex lindsey is here in a rare personal appearance on our show. We're so glad to have him
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.160]   It's memorable once yeah, come here. This is causing all that
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.640]   No, I it's exactly the conversation I wanted to have and it's duplicated in our chat room
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   This is this is a very
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.240]   This is a great conversation and I don't think there is a right answer necessarily. I think it's a lot of opinion
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.160]   I do hope I still think fundamentally it's the bigger problem is the whole system
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.080]   Oh, that's we can complain about what apple is doing
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.960]   But it's really something that we have to get we have to attack the whole system
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.040]   I agree and I do think that uh
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:19.400]   Uh this week in law is the proper forum for the legal discussion of this because we are not attorneys and
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:25.080]   Uh, we don't know but if you if you watch Denise and company when is the next this week in law? I hope they're talking about this
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.720]   Is it uh, was it yesterday or did we move to the Friday? It's Friday
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.760]   So I can almost guarantee that this week in law will
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.040]   Cover this on friday. You should watch at 11 a.m. Pacific
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:41.480]   Uh 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 utc on twit.tv because they're all attorneys
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.800]   Evan and Denise and everybody and so they're gonna have the right and Denise is by the way an intellectual property attorney
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.400]   That's her field
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.360]   So i'm i'm a bobbie watch we should have gotten her in on this on this conversation
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.240]   Why didn't I think of that punch her in? You know why I'll tell you why?
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.240]   You
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   You want to uneducated you
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:06.120]   We can get in there. We can we can sock away. We can and the problem with attorneys is they pause
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.200]   They think when we first started doing this week in law
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.360]   I actually edited out the pauses and then uh victor kyle of uh your typical mac user ended up doing the two because
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.160]   You suppose you say something and go they did go
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.280]   Think about all the options and they think and see this is no good for broadcast. We're obviously not thinking at all
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.480]   I mean, I'm not thinking. I'm just pulling this out. Where did I find this?
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.200]   We don't take that we don't take that five seconds of wonder am I what i'm what am i about to say is that actionable?
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.320]   Yeah
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.880]   Yeah, they're they want they're they're just really thinking
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:43.080]   So I that so I do encourage you it is perhaps something because we stopped editing out the pauses
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.840]   They don't pause as much as they used to but it is a thoughtful show about this subject
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.240]   We just did the un thoughtful. This is the entertainment
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.640]   Is entertaining. Hope no, I think each has its place because you know, we're passionate
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.560]   We feel this with this visceral and there's there's there's something to be said there for that
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.040]   That's our that's our new twit podcast the un thoughtful
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:09.400]   That's a good idea and by the way, you know, I think that one thing is going to be interesting is is what happens when apple wants to do something like glass
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.200]   Like if apple decided that you know when the when the table turns
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.640]   So glass google glass. Oh you mean the glasses?
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.560]   Like when apple so here's the thing is the leapfrog that google has no, you know what?
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.760]   There's so much prior art in these glasses. There's no way of app microsoft's doing it for de laissez
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.160]   But I think that'll be that'll be the interesting thing google well scoogles slugging back believe me
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.800]   They're using mo to roll his patents. Right. Uh, I think it was a florian miller who writes by the way
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.520]   This is the blog on this foss patents
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:45.720]   I think he did point out in foss patents that this the three pat three of the four patents apples litigating are brand new
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:51.960]   They got them they filed for seven years ago, but they got them a few months ago like in december and uh, and
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:59.720]   That's the difference between apples stuff and let's say mo to rolla or google apples getting new patents constantly
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.120]   These other guys are kind of sitting on a patent portfolio for defensive reasons perhaps offensive
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.680]   But they're not making new patents and apple is
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.000]   I I've heard I've heard it incredible numbers about how many patents apple
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.840]   Three of these four are brand new can't get the gutterman december. Yeah
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.400]   All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back. We will talk a little bit about iphone five rumors and
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.640]   Something it's not a rumor mobile meat. What do you do? That was close
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.680]   What do you do? It's three days ago
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.960]   I am for those of you listening
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.400]   Making the gesture of a finger across the throat
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.640]   As a cecilium mafioso might do to indicate
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.880]   Uh, but
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.960]   Duck being stepped on that's exactly right
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.720]   Those stepped out of duck
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.400]   This portion of the show brought to you by our good friends at hover.com
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:58.760]   I spent a lovely weekend finally making the move to hover.com. I didn't realize I had been using domain registrars
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:05.880]   I thought I just used one other there's there. I have domain spread across the universe and i'm moving them all to hover
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:13.400]   It is I have to say if you're gonna do this it is so much easier to not do what I did but to use hovers kosheersh service
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.760]   Give them a call the phone number is at macbreak.hover.com. It's right at the top there 866
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.680]   731
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:26.360]   6556 and say help me hover. I'd like to move everything over now. This is the nice thing
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.280]   They'll do that nominally they charge 25 bucks, but they've been very good to our listeners
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.320]   They I think they'll move that over for you. They do charge you 10 percent ten dollars bucks per domain
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:43.560]   But then you get an extra year so you get what's existing and then another year and that includes things the other guys charge you for like free
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.800]   Who has privacy that's automatic on hover.com? Nobody knows?
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.440]   You know your person a personal dresser phone number. It's always protected
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.760]   They have unlimited domain forwarding very nice dns management tools
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   And they don't upsell you because they don't they don't do they don't do web hosting
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.600]   They will they'll suggest services and products, but they don't they don't do the upsell where you have to check 100 boxes
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.760]   It is so easy. It's really really easy
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.480]   They don't they will do the email forwarding, but they don't do the hosting things like that
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.200]   um
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:23.320]   They are 25 domains you can now register at hover.com.net.co.ca.org but also.it
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.160]   I love the fact that you can see the ones that other people are putting up for sale that are
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.360]   a little bit more expensive. Yeah, it's just hover is great. Just go there
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.000]   Go to Macbreak.hover.com pick out some domain names go through the process just to see it
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.640]   They've got great customer service and no-hole policy
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:44.200]   For calls during business hours when you get a live person you got them they'll solve your problem and won't put you on hold
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.680]   H-O-V-E-R
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.960]   Hover.com and if you do buy a domain name use the offer code Macbreak and you'll get 10% off
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.760]   We love them and I know you will too and I
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.720]   Just it's so much easier having my domains at hover. I gotta say very happy about that
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.000]   All right, you know somebody sent me a note
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.720]   Uh, oh by the way, I should mention
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.920]   We have been getting tweets from lots of people
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.280]   Showing us where they listen to Macbreak weekly. Please
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:20.360]   Here's so bathroom photos. No, this is Ed Lazarus. He apparently listens at the computer medics center. Hello ed
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   Here is Jeremy Kelleher
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.920]   Nice backyard. He's watching from his backyards
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:35.080]   Let's see if there's anyone else. I think that's it, but that's a kind of fun thing. We should start doing that
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:40.280]   When with 10 tennis pictures of where you're listening and does any
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.320]   Is tweeting it the best way to do it. Yeah, I'm watching the Twitter
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.600]   So tweet it. I've been should they should they do it more on twitter lately. I don't know why I just
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.280]   I
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.240]   I don't know why it just seems like that's the one that's kind of survived
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:00.920]   We have good conversations on it. I don't know. I guess I I'm just fickle for a while was google plus
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.920]   effect was one year ago today
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.560]   That I changed my facebook because google plus is a year old last week changed my facebook too
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.520]   I've moved to google plus that didn't last very long
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.920]   I moved back
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:18.680]   Sometimes you move into a place. It smells like fish. You just move back out. You say i'm back. I didn't that was a bad idea
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.360]   Apparently they they cook sardines at google plus. I don't know
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:31.080]   Uh, let's hear about the iPhone 5 a little bit. Um, we had a little I I got a twitter from a tweet from somebody who said
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:36.280]   Why do you assume that apple's gonna put that new connector in why are you we're I was upset about it?
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:42.120]   Remember last week you were sick about it. I was sick to death because I have so much interested in the survey and so many
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:47.000]   Connectors and uh, ryan block, uh, talk me off the ledge on twitter a week ago to ago
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.440]   He said no look this is an old connector. They needed a new connector. This is a good connector
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.840]   But somebody else has pointed out that apple has multiple prototypes
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.440]   So yes, it's kind of clear because of the video and the pictures that there is at least a prototype with a new
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.400]   19 pin connector replacing the 30 pin connector, but
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.280]   That may just be one of several and maybe if we make enough noise
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.480]   They'll keep the 30 pin. Why don't I just do thunderbolt?
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:18.680]   I'll tell you why what would you use thunderbolt for on a phone? It was just it was just so it'd be one data port
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:25.000]   What are you gonna do? You're gonna transfer data 8 gigabytes of data a second from your phone? Yeah, I'd like to actually
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.720]   Talking to me. Yeah, I mean come on now
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.160]   I was like I want to be able to plug cameras into my phone
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.640]   Also, also, I think thunderbolt needs CPU support and they wouldn't be able to do it on a mobile device
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.160]   Plus
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.200]   The other thing is that in in china they make all kinds of parts for all kinds of people
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   and it's there I
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:50.520]   Remember I remember a story about someone who picked up a counterfeit part and sent it sent it to not me
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.960]   It's to a different well-known like mac and apple pundered
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:59.480]   And it looked really good. It had the apple. I think it even had the apple logo on it
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.560]   It was the right shape was right size, but it was just a phony part that was
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.760]   Make by god knows whom for god knows what purpose
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.480]   So it's that that part is a really good point of discussion for how we would react to a different port
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   Right, but it means as always
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.960]   It no matter how excited I get up I get about a certain rumor no matter how good it looks
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:26.600]   Until a week before release. I have to remind myself that I have no idea what the next iPhone or iPad is going to look like until
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.880]   I'm actually at an event and actually seeing what I'm holding one of my hands
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.480]   Yeah, no, I think that's a really important point. That's why I wanted to bring that up
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.320]   And I wouldn't put it past apple to make a few
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   Phony prototypes. Oh, I don't think I don't think about it with that
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.480]   They've done it in the past in fact
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.040]   We we heard that they would if you're new at apple
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.520]   They'll make up a fake project for you to work out for a few months just to see if you're at leaky sieve
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:58.360]   Mm. That's pretty that's hard core about secrecy and didn't tim cook say he was gonna double down on secrecy
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:04.120]   Well started, you know, I think that apple for a long time was very very quiet and then it started to get a little more leaky
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.840]   Yeah, and so I think they're just kind of pulling pulling that back in again. Wells Fargo
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:16.200]   It's worth they have an analyst division because evidently Wells Fargo is the the leading expert in technology news
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.920]   Should I not even quote this? I just know it was just a nice thing to say
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.720]   For apple, you know
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.000]   Some people watch this show and they say you guys should not be on this show because you should only say nice things about apple
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.640]   On a show called mac break weekly. So i'm gonna say something nice
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:39.880]   Wells Fargo says the iPhone 5 launch will be the biggest product launch in consumer electronics history
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.200]   That's a big comment
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.760]   Bigger than connect
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.280]   Bigger than the galaxy i was like i was like, what is what is that connect was huge microsoft?
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.160]   I did a thing and it was on an xbox and they sold like a million of them a day. It was like huge
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.440]   Bigger than ipad
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.160]   I guess if there's i mean it depends on i guess how many people are using the 3gs or the you know
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:09.560]   A lot of the cheaper ones and maybe this is going to be the big bump up above the four s but the reason that the reason this is germane
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:15.320]   Is Wells Fargo is telling its clients its customers that the stock is undervalued
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:20.520]   Isn't it crazy to have a company the size of apple and and you have them keep on saying that the stock is undervalued
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.960]   Crazy it's worth more
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.880]   Um, they expect a 12x price to earnings
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.760]   I don't I don't I don't understand how the iphone becomes the biggest consumer product launch in
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.400]   History there's I mean apple is behind I think half of those I could tell you right now
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.760]   It won't be if they change the damn can i'm sorry father forgive me gd connector
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.120]   Then see that's how mad I am about that
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.600]   Well, I mean, we'll we'll forget all about it so long as it's a
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.760]   Songs it's a good decision. I don't think that anyone's gonna make a big fuss about it
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:01.720]   I mean, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's tough beans for anybody who has like a hardware dock connector in their car
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.600]   But for almost everybody else it'd be a very easy
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:10.760]   It's also like buy a new cable if you have that I got my wife one of those little speak alarm clock speaker systems that you drop your phone
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.920]   Your iPhone that's when I had yeah, those are the kind of things that
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.080]   It becomes a $200 clock right now. I didn't buy it they gave it to me
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.320]   But it but I bought it I just want to say I bought it
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.200]   I have that renew clock, you know, we reviewed it and uh
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:28.600]   It watches you sleep and then gives you a graph on your iPhone of how well you slept right and then it asks you when you wake up
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.800]   How do you feel how do you feel tired?
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.320]   Happy
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.400]   Crumpy and then I have the graph of how you felt how I sleep
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.560]   See I was up
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.720]   And then I was asleep and then I was up and I was just i'm an old man. I get up to p
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.880]   Come on. Give me a break mine is just always up
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.440]   It's like little uh maps up
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   See the white ones are we don't see you
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.480]   You're either awake or there's no signal
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.000]   The little ones are light sleep and the long ones are but see this isn't gonna work anymore
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.560]   Because it this this requires one of these 30 pin i'm sure that i'm sure that someone is gonna make a little like
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.800]   Uh doc snuggie for it that'll
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:13.400]   Snuggie. Oh, I'm sorry. It's scoash scosh made something like that when they changed the the internal configuration of the the pin connector
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.560]   So that no that the power passed through became different. So you got the full
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.360]   It's gonna be okay. I know
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.960]   People people people like me will crout will create a huge think about it in the first week
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.320]   Particularly if it looks like the only reason why they did it was because style
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   But after that it's gonna be a non-issue. I'm gonna cheer myself up. Here's a david love camp. He's watching us at work
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:39.000]   Right now. David does a very nice work setup that includes a chicago bull's poster and a st
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.080]   Louis cardinals mouse pad. He's clearly and a calculator
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.520]   I don't I let's guess what david does for a living. I don't know
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.120]   He's he's pointed at a cube
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.560]   Here's another guy watching at work. This is nicholas de salvo. Oh, he's got like
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:01.880]   He's got stuff. He's got a whiteboard and stuff. Here's a guy mark moran
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.600]   He's outside of the pool. Oh, I like that one. He's bob a cuba. That is the way
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   He's bob a cubit on this stay before the independence day holiday
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:16.360]   How about kyle duffield? This is awesome. I know I love it. I forget the news
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.760]   Like we could talk about patons, but we can look at everybody's house. Yeah, erin nelson
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.560]   Let's see where erin's watching from. I'm just I'm everybody's settings
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:29.160]   That's that's work looks like he sells uh apple stuff right there. Doesn't that or something?
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.480]   He's got a lot of that box is there. He's got bad as a well designed. Yes
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.800]   Isn't that nice and clean? Yeah, my never done all blue tooth
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.120]   I don't know what that little screen a little base green a ginormous screen and then a macbook air
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.160]   He's all set and he's got his ipad there or something
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.680]   I don't know. That's a great setup. That's a nice site out. So here's a
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.560]   Magic on play bahoe
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.880]   From his hummafis
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   It apparently it's brutally hot in minnesota
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.760]   So everybody's staying inside. There's Andy and not go on the screen there for matt puckso
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.160]   Exactly the way to use two screens
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.720]   Yes side-by-side and then look he's got the ipad if he needs to you know play angry birds
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.560]   This is this is a guy with a chimpanzee ceramic
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.960]   He's having a little Chinese food. That's just in clay like after effects
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:22.040]   That's an after effects interface. I have opened a can of worms here
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   It just keeps on coming
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.880]   We like to hear from all of our listeners inside apple who watch live
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.680]   Yeah
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.480]   Let's see some pictures of an iPhone 5
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.680]   Hardware prototypes
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.920]   Financial acrobat has a scary dog, but he's got a nice
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.000]   Lot of people listening at work. Oh look this look that looks like a podcast is Mike Kerr
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.880]   Is his home studio? He's set up
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.240]   Joe kunya is making lunch and watching mac break weekly
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.720]   Hey looks like a
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.560]   By
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.480]   You're a big griller
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.520]   I love the grill. I'm lighting up the big green egg tomorrow
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.080]   The big green egg. What is that?
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.480]   That's my that's my that's my that's my that's your grill my grill
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.760]   Here's a guy watching it in the nursing home sous vide with a big green egg necklace pits watching in the nursing home there
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.960]   This looks like an apartment where there is probably a bong on the coffee table. I'm just saying
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:17.640]   There's a lot of dude. I'm just saying dude. I recognize the bros. Alex is so agro man
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:26.680]   Shaggy dog design studios on the line here. This is Thomas lampmen. All right. This is enough
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.160]   I can't do it. I'm getting I'm getting so many of these now
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.160]   But this is not we should do that we should show so this is the thing is this this
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.360]   Look at this guy's desktop. He's got a picture of the moon a big high res picture of the moon
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.200]   That looks like a 30 inch screen. He's got there
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:45.080]   That's nice. That's nice. That's Jason perry. Here's somebody in scotland
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.760]   Nexus
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.520]   1974 he says he's watching from a rainy day in scotland
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   Okay, i'm jealous
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.680]   That looks nice there. It's a little cooler there
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   It's for his flat in the rainy scotland some of our team was in scotland last week doing doing a stream and and I was in
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   Washington DC and it was
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.280]   104 degrees. Oh, it was brutal. It was brutal last week. I was there for the storm. It was exciting
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:13.720]   I hope y'all are gonna have a great independence day holiday now you have to declare your independence from
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.360]   me.com
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.560]   Look at this. This is the sign they put on the front page saturday night saturday night. I was like it's like seven o'clock
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.880]   I'm like oh my gosh it swings when you first get there. That's well well played. That's beautiful
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.440]   kind of depressing
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:34.200]   So for a limited time if you are a mobile me member you can go to me.com and i'm going to do this sign in to download
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.240]   Your photos from i gallery
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.600]   So I just want to say this is this is well well done by apple because this could have gone really badly saturday night
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.880]   I suddenly realized it was the last day and I went up to my mobile me and realized there was like 28 gigs of stuff there
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.520]   That I had to pull off and i was like no there's no way I can do that from the hotel i'm in so um
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.720]   Well, it's kind of a cross loading so you log in to your apple account
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:04.360]   And then it crossloads it over to uh iCloud that's great if but then what happens if you said 28 gigs
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   You only have five gigs of iCloud storage would have more than that in iCloud
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.560]   So I presume I guess you'd buy more I already did
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:17.880]   Also congratulations. I've moved it all over. I haven't done that. Just like that. I wasn't I was doing mad
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.120]   I was doing mad like crazy like i'm just gonna have to pick and choose what i'm gonna keep because everything else is gonna go
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:27.160]   Oh, I got more bad news for you and to this month. I work dies. I never used I use it
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.640]   I use it all the time for keynotes. I would upload keynotes there share them. Okay have them there in case you know
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.120]   Worst thing that could happen, right? You got a keynote presentation your computer dies your thumb drive dies
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:40.840]   You don't have a copy of it, but you could say hey, let me borrow your computer. You go to i work and there it is
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.240]   That's why I did that I just kept them all on thumb drives. What if you lose your thumb drive?
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.720]   I know I I guess that would be possible
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:52.120]   Any suggestions Andy what are you writing articles for the Chicago Sun times on?
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.400]   Mobile me replacements if I could
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.520]   Not not really i'm I have I have some notes on a couple of different things to move to but the thing
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:07.960]   But the the reason why i'm mobile me got closed down was because everybody already sort of independently found their own replacements for mobile
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.040]   Me starting like four years ago
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:16.200]   Uh, but you know who did is the most vulnerable among us the the people who weren't sophisticated enough to do that
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.240]   I talked to somebody a blind user in hawai lovely elderly woman who used iWeb
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.240]   On the weekend she said what am I gonna do? How do I save my site?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:30.280]   Yeah, and and I there are a couple of good web tools
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.880]   Of for that I mean sandbox is really great. My matter of fact
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:39.720]   It actually also has like a built-in iWeb migration tool. I told you about sandbox good. I'm glad you agree
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.040]   Yeah, also also it's probably
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.560]   It's it was the it was the app that I would recommend that I used to recommend people use instead of iWeb
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:56.680]   Because it gives you all the flex of all the ease of of setup of uh of a website through iWeb without being nearly as annoying or or as limiting
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:03.640]   Um, and also if you're launching i was surprised and pleased the other day when I launched aperture for just note for
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.720]   An unrelated project and it said oh by the way mobile may has shut down
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:13.320]   Do you want me to download all of your photos you put into mobile galleries and then add them to your aperture library?
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.440]   I already already downloaded everything but i'm like new picture
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.760]   Yeah, doesn't it?
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   And it was an interesting experience because I I downloaded everything about three days before the shut the the the announced shut down and it was like
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   It really was like going through a storage locker that you filled up and sort of abandoned three years ago
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:39.560]   Because it was just nothing but like photos and documents of things I was working on like in 2007 2008
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.080]   Because I really hadn't even touched it outside of outside of
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:49.320]   Those hysterically angry days when you really need to share a big file with somebody and for some reason
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:54.760]   These seven other ways you would usually do it none of them work. So it's like it's come down to this
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.880]   I'm actually signing signing in to mobile me
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:03.480]   This is the sign that god has not chosen me as one of his beloved on this day
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.560]   What have the chosen people Andy? Yes, you're a boba beer
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:13.480]   That's pretty much the same for me. I mean I had when I was very going through it. It was like I think the latest entry was like fall of 2009
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.400]   Yeah, so I get it
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.120]   Um, so what if you had a gallery on there?
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:24.040]   Is it analog for that that you could use that's an apple analog or do you have to go to I don't know google pakasa or something?
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:31.000]   I think that I think the best choice is going to be flicker pakasa or an independent photo hosting site
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.320]   I don't think that there's anything
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.680]   Gotta think that apple has any sort of really happy direct replacement
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.440]   There is something kind of like that on the ios version of iPhoto
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.520]   Where you can create journals that are nice free form
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:49.960]   Presentations of photos arranged the way that you want them to but that's not on the desktop yet
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.720]   So I yeah, this is this is the reason why I really never chose
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:52:01.320]   I never really chose idiscra mobile me for my photo sharing it's always been flicker because I like this nice central
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.880]   Central repository that does a lot more than just allow me to share albums
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:14.840]   Uh for the developers using ios 6 mac rumors has a great uh preview some desktop shots of
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:25.480]   The web versions of notes and reminders. This is the iCloud beta portal which has been activated for ios 6 beta developers at beta.iCloud.com
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.240]   Um, here's the new uh find my iphone
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.160]   It's kind of interesting. There's the map up in the right corner
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.040]   There's a picture of in this case an ipad and three buttons play sound lock or erase
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.680]   It's still a google map, which is kind of interesting. I wonder if that'll change
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.080]   um
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.120]   Notes
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:51.480]   This is notes on the it looks just like actually the notes uh notepad on the iphone except that you have enough room now
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.560]   You have on the left you have it's kind
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:59.000]   It's we we now realize this is a leather folio because it's got the stitching the little pocket
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.840]   Stuffed in the pocket is your list of uh notes. I'm really kind of over that
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.760]   That's one thing I have to say about all the apples. This is like I don't really need to make it look like a notebook
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.800]   Yeah, this kind of drives me crazy. This is almost extreme at this point
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.400]   Yeah, I know they wanted to feel physical, but the whole thing makes me a little crazy. Yeah
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.080]   Reminders has been removed from the calendar app and is now in its own
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:22.360]   App and there's the reminders. It's not so askewomorphic. It's not so uh realistic
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   It's just looks like a little bit more digital. Yeah
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.840]   um
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.960]   I didn't know there's 125 million iCloud users as of April
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:34.120]   125 million
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.800]   That's a lot of users. Yeah
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.600]   Well, but remember that remember that whenever you activate a new phone
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.800]   It pretty much walks you through. Hey touch this button and now we'll give you a free iCloud account, but you don't have to
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.560]   You don't have to but how many people say no
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.600]   Yeah, I mean it's worth it. I recommend people do it, but I think I you know
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.880]   Well, I'm looking like I looked at Jennifer's iPhone the other day to see if it was
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.920]   Enabled it wasn't I looked at iPad. See if it was enabled. It wasn't I said do you want to back this up?
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   Then I made a huge mistake
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   You I logged her into my iCloud account and all my messages
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:13.160]   Flooded into her phone. Nice. That was good. Yeah, I made a good friend that way
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:19.880]   So don't do that folks give it's free to create an independent account and you get five gigs of storage
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.360]   You should do that because if you if you share
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:29.400]   Accounts then you also are sharing things like messages by the way you cannot now download anymore the messages beta
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.320]   I tried to the other day on the new retina
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.160]   Because I wanted on the retina. So I think that's a signal mountain lion, which is gonna
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:41.400]   I think feature that it's coming soon app is coming soon. I can't wait turned it off. It was better than lion
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.760]   Not that I'm bitter
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.400]   So what do I wait can I can I I talked about something on the last show I was on can I give people an update? Yes
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.880]   So I um I updated my my tower to lion. It was the last computer left
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.840]   I had put lion slowly on things carefully and my tower has a software raid
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.400]   So it has three three drives rated with you know my aperture library and other things on it
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.520]   And um, and so when the when lion came up. Yeah, the raid was gone
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.720]   They were just they were just three drives with your data there all the all my data was there
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.640]   Oh good. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no the day that day it was there, but the drive it
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.800]   Yeah, when the rate it could read it. You could see three drives, but but it can no longer see the raid
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.920]   That's not good. And so I you know, I called of course if I called dis savers
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.880]   I was like getting ready to cause you know, rude and I talked to Brent uh schnar
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.160]   Who's one of our guys one of our very smart guys at the pixx core?
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:37.640]   And um, he's like oh just put snow leopard back on yeah, and uh, he said it'll just find it
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:41.160]   It'll just rebuild it immediately. And so just in case you're wondering put a new drive in
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:46.120]   Install snow leopard is there was no rebuild as soon as no off the raid. Oh, no, no, I took it all
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:50.520]   I mean so just to put it in perspective. The reason I wasn't too stressed about it is up until the last two months
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.160]   Everything had been and I've been really busy. I've been really busy lately
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.280]   Everything was completely backed up. So it wasn't it wasn't like I lost a time
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.160]   You're no fool
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.600]   But at the same time the last three months of photos were on the aperture
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.520]   And I hadn't done my little backup thing my vault because I was upgrading some drobos and stuff like that. Anyway, so
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.840]   um
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.560]   Anyway, but just if you ever if you ever do that one thing to know is if you go into lion your software raid will be broken
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:18.920]   And I don't even know how to fix it and uh, it's terrible snow leopard will just immediately see it again and it's not a problem
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:23.000]   So I think some people are asking me on it's a software raid right?
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.520]   That's part of it. Yeah, but but it's just you just and you know
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:31.240]   Obviously the big thing to do is that we call them scary raids in our office for a good reason
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.880]   All of the raids that we build are called scary raids are not everybody but not reliable fast
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:40.200]   Yeah, but don't defend them and the other thing is is that someone asked me like are you gonna build a part of the problem?
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.360]   Was the raid was really small? It's three gig three terabytes
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.560]   I don't want to build it any bigger than that because I don't ever want to allow myself to put more than three terabytes on something
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:51.320]   That's that's there so you do you're doing a striped raid not a mirrored raid. You're doing it
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.480]   So that's fast writing 300 megs a sec so you can record your well like when you're well
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.920]   You can record video, but also you can you know everything runs faster
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:03.000]   You know and if you have an ssd startup drive and a and a three drive raid
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.360]   Um your tower is about you know as fast as it's gonna get I gotta show you something
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.120]   Ooh, that's pretty
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.320]   Yeah, by the way, I mentioned this last week in her facelift
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.760]   So I only have 28 80 by 1800 when you get your new retina. You've got to upgrade all your desktop wallpaper
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.680]   Nice because but fortunately, I'm never gonna get my new retina. I've given up
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.880]   How long did you ordered a day of and they say what a minute?
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.920]   You gotta get we were sitting on the show and i'm sitting there going refresh refresh refresh
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.720]   As soon as it comes up I went through and it was the amount of time
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:36.760]   It took me to run the order and I had and I had ordered it. I was it was a built-to-order had all the stuff in it and
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.920]   uh
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:44.040]   And I just checked the apple and it's like delivery sometime between july 9th and july 20th and
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.240]   Well, let me just I just not that I'm sitting here. You're gonna get this soon
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.200]   I just want to show you the usb 3.0
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.400]   Benchmarks that I did. Oh, is it working now?
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:59.640]   So here's the deal this I had to find a u.s. A lot of the usb 3 drivers aren't done yet. Really?
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.680]   Well, this is definitely usb 3 speed so a lot of the I bought a
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:10.600]   Corsair GT that did not live up to its promise in terms of usb 3 speed, but this is a usb thumb drive
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:16.680]   Uh using the I like this. This is the black magic. I think you might have even recommended it back speed test
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:23.560]   You combine it on the app store because you can see it's from black magic because really what it's saying is how high quality video
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:28.600]   Can you read and write but this is a usb thumb drive? This is the hyper x from king's dev
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:33.880]   It is 64 gigabytes for about a hundred bucks. It's reading at
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:39.480]   250 megabytes a second a thumb drive and it's writing at 109 megabytes a second
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   But you really want to see something even more awesome awesome. Uh, this is the native ssd built into the retina
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.600]   So it's using they use a very good sand force controller
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:56.920]   It's writing at 383 megabytes a second on sata. This is satas six of course and it's reading
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   It's redlining the black magic
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.360]   Uh speed thing at 442 megabytes a second. It was very close to half a gigabyte a second
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.000]   Is that fast enough? You know, I don't want to sound like an old foggy, but
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.640]   I remember back when we spent no no we spent we spent $2,000 to build 120 gigabyte drive that could do
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.400]   190 to 200 megabytes a second
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:22.040]   Now you can do it in your laptop on the ssd and in the retina it's crazy
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:28.360]   So i'm very happy with that thumb drive, but I would caution that not all usb 3 thumb drives seem to give you the full throughput
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:33.160]   I had it. I tried I bought the uh, I bought the course here and I like course here thumb drives
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:37.240]   I've had a number of course here thumb drives and uh, its results were not
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.080]   Quite as fast. Here's the here's the course here results
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.560]   I got 78.9 megabytes per second right again. I'm just like
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.200]   100 thumb drive read thumb drive
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:53.960]   We used to re-stripe our raids every week to make sure that you do 30 megas a second to do uncompressed sd video
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:57.320]   And now there's a thumb drive that's something. It's important. I know i'm sounding like an old foggy
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.520]   But I just have to keep on reminding people that this is a drive drive. It's a sick
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.200]   It's a hundred dollars 64 gigabytes around my neck. Yeah
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.040]   And it and it's at that speed. So what i'm using it for is aperture
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.360]   That's what I put all my photos on right because I don't want to fill up my internal drive with pictures
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.560]   The drives that we were re-striping all the time they were six gigabytes
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.120]   That was
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.920]   They were anyway, and uh, you know, I don't mind 256 gigs. Well, I bet well, so you did a BTO
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.280]   You put 16 gigs of ram of course. Yeah, I put the faster processor
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.440]   I'm having a hard right seven to get the seven fifty six. So it was and you got the top of the line i7
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.840]   Yes, that's gonna be a screamer. It's fast. Well, he's also got to be four thousand dollars
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:40.200]   Almost I was a little bit more than that. It was a little bit with tax and and you know, of course
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.920]   I got the you know the apple of care stuff and all that other stuff so the but the um
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.680]   Uh, we already started doing streaming tests with it and it's faster
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:55.640]   The laptop is faster than our our desktop when it comes to like wirecast is actually the laptop is actually using less
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.440]   um, CPU power than our tower
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:04.840]   Just saying so I have to log into iWork says to your iWork user
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.200]   Did you know that this was gonna happen that they were gonna kill this iWork.com?
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.000]   Uh, there there are rumors about it. And in july
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.320]   You will no longer be able to access your documents on the iWork.com site or review them on the web
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.120]   Sign in and download them to your computer
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.960]   Moving forward you can use iCloud to store your documents
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.560]   I really liked this uh, iWork, uh system though because it was I don't know it was just seemed nice
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.200]   But I guess nobody used it. I didn't like it. You didn't like it
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.120]   I want to be I just wanted to be here's the thing is I want I wanted to be a pretty version of google docs
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.160]   Like that's like for me. That's what I like what I like well, that's called microsoft's office 365
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.080]   By the way, yeah, I mean exactly with office 360. I just wanted to be pages
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.320]   Do you mind using word and i hate excel?
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:51.880]   Hate excel like like it like it then the only thing I hate more than excel are the spreadsheets in google
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.560]   Do you like chrome?
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.440]   Yeah, I love chrome. How do you like chrome on the iphone on the ipad gentlemen?
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.600]   I I like it. I don't know if it's compelling enough for me to constantly be you know figuring out
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.440]   But I thought I thought it's very snappy
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.400]   I installed it immediately. It's not uh, of course apple will not let any third party browser
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   Be the default browser, right?
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.640]   Um, it's very crumish. Yeah, and then you have a menu here new tab new on incognito tab
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.920]   Bookmarks because it's chroma it syncs all your bookmarks
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.760]   From
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.720]   Your desktop it also syncs your tabs. So if I've got a tab open on another device
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.480]   I can see what these are these are the pages. I should be careful what i'm looking at
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:36.840]   These are the pages i've got open on my macbook retina my galaxy s3 my obuntu
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.880]   My uh macbook air 13 my iphone 4 isn't that nice?
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.000]   Yeah, it's I think it's those are the pages I have open and especially if you're living in a google environment
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.520]   We have you know, we're generating five or ten google docs a day
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.400]   And so, you know all of this stuff works really well
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.520]   And here's the feature that a lot of people seem to like there's a button on here that says request desktop site
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.280]   So if you get a mobile site, I should go to uh, you're i'll go to lea ville
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.520]   That's a good one because I have it I have it mobilized which is by the way no longer the thing to do
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.920]   uh, you're supposed to uh, be adaptive and and and uh
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.520]   So you're so hard to use using a keyboard. Oh, look it gave me the desktop site
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.760]   huh
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.120]   Huh, so you if you gave if you got the mobile site you can request the desktop site
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.440]   Um, I guess i'm smart enough not to do that on the ipad. I'm so smart
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:35.800]   Um, I've always thought so leo yes voice search built in that's kind of neat probably also violation of apples patterns
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.800]   Um
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.240]   So this is I and it feels snappy. What do you think? How do you like chrome on the uh?
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:47.160]   On i like it. I like it a lot. I love the way that it organizes open tabs on on the iphone edition
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.640]   That makes a much better use of uh of the window space. Uh, it's prettier. They're nice
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.160]   Uh, sense uh comments really really nice
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.280]   Sensible little graphical flourishes that help you as you move from one part of the app to the other
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.960]   The only real disadvantage
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.800]   I the only real thing I don't like about it is that sharing is really very very limited if not non-existent
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.600]   Um, I I ran into two problems my first day with the with the iphone and the ipad versions
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:19.560]   Uh, i'm just using that i'm enjoying it on the iphone going through the things that I use a browser for on the iphone
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.080]   I hit a page saying oh, I want to tweet out a link to this. Oh, no, sorry
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.280]   There's no like share there's no sharing button so I can't just simply tweet out a link actually had to go into safari
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:33.880]   Reopen it and then hit that button there. Um, that is that is frustrating. Do you think that's an apple thing or a?
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.880]   chrome thing
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.760]   I have no idea
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:41.240]   I want it's it's it's it's an omission. I think they really should have fixed that yeah, because it's such a useful feature
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.200]   But then there's another thing that uh, I've gotten used to in safari where I was reading an article
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.840]   Uh tapped on a link and turned out to be a pdf
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.880]   And so almost instinctively I wanted to send that into iBook so I could save it for a broffline reading
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:59.880]   And of course you can't do that in google chrome you can't just simply funnel something into into iBook star into another pdf reader
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.760]   So there's that as well. So that's really the only comp the only complaints I was having about it
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.960]   Uh, of course sharing with google plus works just fine. Oh, of course
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:14.760]   It's like it's my point that out. It's no trouble
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:22.040]   So so many google products on on every single piece of hardware be it be it windows mac
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.160]   Android or iOS it's like
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.440]   You're you're the product is on the top of the hill
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.320]   And at the bottom of the hill is always google plus so if you just kick one pebble over
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.840]   Then the natural flow of water is to land it right in the middle google plus yeah, that's true
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:44.200]   Um somebody's pointing out and this of course is true that ios 5 does have an api for at least for tweeting
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.920]   Uh, and so there would it would be an easy thing for google to have added tweet this
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:55.240]   Um, so you're right. I think Andy that that's something that google omitted. It does work well with google plus. Did we say that?
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.440]   Oh by the way
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.280]   Uh, iphone and uh ipad
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.440]   You know, it's nice to have i like chrome i use chrome on most of my platforms as you could see so
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:09.240]   It's nice to have it if you go into the habit now where you go to any other browser and you just start typing searches into the main
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.520]   Into the main bar
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:13.880]   I think i use chrome like by 90 percent of the time. That's exactly why i'm like, and then you're like
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.120]   What's wrong with these, you know, and then you're gonna fix in the wrong browser fix in it the next safari is gonna fix it
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.280]   You don't have to worry about that wrong. We'll have one box you enter everything into one box
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:27.160]   Firefox doesn't have that although you could still type in the url box the search right it will still work
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.000]   Um, but you did you didn't bring up a good point leo. I mean i the the
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.600]   I almost there's almost the moment that I that uh that I started thinking about something
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.160]   I was I moved over to the during fireball page and I saw the group were was thinking the exact same thing
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:47.560]   Which is that man if apple is allowing a third a such a prominent third party browser
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.280]   But they're not allowing people to change the default browser away from safari
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.360]   Is that going to be a future source of legal trouble for apple?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:02.680]   Is that going to be a real non-competitive problem that is that it's not a vulnerability that a
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.440]   A sufficiently
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.640]   Company that apple has declared war against could make trouble for apple in return
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.000]   One good thing google
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.400]   This analysis the google IO you can now edit
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:24.200]   Uh google docs look it's huge. I am editing my google
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.360]   Dark
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.400]   Right from within ios that's a nice feature. I left to say happy about that
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.200]   um
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.040]   Google is working on offline editing as well, although not implemented
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:43.480]   Yet that's going to be a nice capability when you can just get on the plane and everything
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.920]   There that shows up for me every time I get on a plane because I have so much stuff that'll do that a lot
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.840]   And you're just kind of like oh, yeah, so that's gonna be huge for you. Yeah, yeah, absolutely
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:58.280]   I presume it'll do it ios in on the ios ios web market share now past 65 percent
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.680]   so uh
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.720]   Net net market share does this ios dominates when it comes to
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.000]   web access
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.480]   65 15 percent increase year over year
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.040]   Android 1 percent
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:20.680]   Blackberry 2 percent i probably spent 80 percent of my web browsing on
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:27.400]   On uh, why on my iPad or if these numbers about android adoption are correct. Why is android only 1 percent?
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.120]   iPad
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.960]   ah
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:36.280]   I don't believe I I I haven't read that every time i've seen a number like that
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.720]   I've seen like how they how they affected it is
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.400]   Every time i've seen a number like that it turns out that it's been all of ios versus all of android
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   When you factor in tens of millions of ipads into the equation. It's no it's no wonder
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.200]   I haven't seen that exact uh that exact study that you're you're quoting right there, but I wouldn't be surprised
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.520]   It's pretty amazing
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:03.720]   Yeah, especially especially because right but it's it's amazing how much traffic full stop is being done via mobile devices
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.000]   I just hooked up
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.400]   I just hooked up analytics on my own blog on the celestial waste of plan with just like a month and a half ago
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.760]   And it really did surprise me that uh by by a considerable stretch most people are in our accessing my blog
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.680]   Like via some kind of a mobile device
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.480]   I I would not have predicted that
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.960]   So android has 50 percent market share
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:31.400]   But apple has 65 percent browsing i had to admit that I find that that browsing i mean I have a galaxy s2 that i use probably 30
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.400]   Of the day and um
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.920]   Uh, I don't find that browsing on it is particularly easy
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.160]   It's hard on any phone. It's hard on any phone. It says good on the iPhone. I think it's easier on the iPhone
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.480]   Okay, I think it's I would go to the iPad or a desktop
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.280]   I think the auto film on the the auto film on the iphone is better than the android than the s2
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.120]   There's a patent for that. Yeah, evidently because it's it's really painful
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:58.280]   The app store will soon have its own food and drink you'll be happy about this
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.720]   Griller and bartender its own food and drink category. I already have most of those applications
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.200]   This is from max stories developers are getting emails
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.080]   Saying we will migrate your relevant apps to the new food and drink category
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.440]   If you have a food or drink product
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.080]   That's good. Yeah, I wonder what they what the criterion is for giving a
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.040]   Product its own category
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.240]   Maybe enough flow because I mean the thing is I think that this is the
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.120]   uh
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:37.800]   I think that food and drink is just such a huge place for a platform for university the iPad
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.000]   Right, that's how I make like crepes or something is that I I put an iPad, you know, carefully way
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.960]   Yeah, and I go to epicureus and I search for the the crepes that I'm looking for and made
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.640]   And if you have something like this is the um, I have the logitech ultra sin uh keyboard cover
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.320]   Which is a keyboard, but it's also a perfect angle for cooking right?
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.240]   So I use this I actually leave this on my counter in my kitchen all the time
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.880]   Uh, that's the iPad and yes he throws a towel over the keyboard kind of messy
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.760]   Exactly. It's kind of but you know the I'll just I run my keyboard through the dishwasher
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:16.040]   What can I say bob man's field retiring? He's the heavy set guy you see on all those videos
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.400]   He's the you know, I had okay, please forgive me for this
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:26.440]   Apple, you know when they show the videos they're all very feet nicely dressed and bob man's feels the good blue collar guy
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.480]   In those videos it makes you feel like it as a guy in there who's who's really getting down
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.120]   He's doing the job. He's waking he is of course the senior vice president of hardware engineering
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.680]   Right, but he just looks like that nice blue collar guy in there who's really fixing his stuff
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.680]   You know, I I can get in there with a wrench you give me a some pliers
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.800]   And I will fix it. So there's johnny. I've it's very a feat
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:54.520]   There's you know scott forest all is very a feat. They're all hipsters. Look at johnny. I have in his black collarless t-shirt
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.880]   And then scroll down to bob man's hey, I can you give me a wrench a hammer in 15 minutes
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.880]   I can fix that right away. You give me a
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.120]   I need a wrench a hammer to chinese dictionary
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.520]   I'm good to go you catch me with a collar this shirt
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:14.600]   You could kick my butt because I am not gonna wear one of them things and uh, yeah, they made me take the pocket protector out just
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.280]   For this picture, but I'm putting it back in immediately afterwards
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.120]   He's a real man and he left us. He was like, I'm embarrassed
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.240]   I'm embarrassed to be with these guys. No, I'm just
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.080]   I I'm not I'm not the smartest human being in the world
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.800]   But there's some dumb things that I don't do and that is make comments, but other people's personal appearance. That's all
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:40.520]   If we're if we're still doing this podcast as like audio only maybe I think dumb enough to risk it
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.360]   But I've gotten out of the same that subject you guys can drink your shirt and age your shab leezers there
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.760]   I give me a good beer anytime. I want to hang town. Hell yeah, that's all i'm gonna drink
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:56.120]   Anyway, no employees mentioned in the past five minutes. I think you're all lovely lovely people
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.920]   Lovely lovely
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.760]   And of course it's it's completely big and unbiased to me and I apologize
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.920]   But I love the fact that you get bob man's feel on these videos
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:12.840]   And he's just he's he looks like me is always and he's a little heavy set no nonsense no nonsense
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.120]   Like this is what we had to do it looks like it might be from pittsburgh
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.180]   Which is always something that I respect. Yeah, don't you think I like that he talks like an
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:26.540]   Engineer though. He's an engineer. Anyway, we'll be sorry to miss him. I just wanted to give him a nice farewell
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.140]   Now that he did that so well
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.860]   With his prominent position you thought you'd say some things
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:38.780]   Hey, I gave up on getting invited apple events a long time ago. Let me tell you right now
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.380]   Orbitz get this and they and they admit it
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:48.140]   When you search orbits, which is the travel site where you get hotels flights so forth when you search orbits
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.380]   On a mac it recommends more expensive hotels
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:59.900]   And and they admit it saying the travel search engine is simply showing users what it thinks they prefer
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.260]   Orbitz chief executive officer barney harford
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:10.540]   Said data collected by orbits shows mac users are 40 more likely than pc users to book four or five star hotels
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:15.340]   So we're going to show them the four or five star hotels. This is good business
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:21.020]   You see the other ones. It's just it's just what it's list where a windows user i'd be hurt
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:26.620]   And here's the thing is all i gotta say is that if you're using orbits to buy your hotels to crazy
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:33.340]   That's most mac users your smart windows. You're too smart to do using hotels.com because you get one is that the one for every 10 nights
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:37.660]   And they're not paying me to say that i've got like 15 nights waiting for me for free
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:41.900]   We should do a travel program. I'd love to do a travel. You are the frequent traveler. I would love to do it
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.180]   You and johnny jet get you on together. I'm good to go
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:50.460]   So where do you use hotels hotels. I'll tell us that calm not price line. No, no, no
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.460]   Not jet setter. No
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.500]   Not not hip month. Let me repeat
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.620]   For every 10 nights you get one free night. See i don't get 10 nights or change in you get real
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.500]   No, see i get i have like i have like 17 free nights
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:08.540]   I do that's because oh wait a minute in order to get 17 free nights at a point out folks
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.740]   He has to spend 170 nights in a hotel
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.100]   But how are those hotels in the tenderloi
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.580]   Still with the really crunchy over here's the best part is that it's just it's just you get
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:24.940]   It just discounts whatever you have 10% so i'll have a coupon for like a the average of those 10 nights
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.820]   So 170 so if I want to stay in a really nice five star hotel
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.660]   And it's too expensive. It's too expensive for me. I can't afford that kind of thing on my own
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.860]   I can just get it. I can just discount whatever that cost is as well
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:40.780]   And it's great because it keeps your wife from being totally upset with you because you're spent 170 nights in a hotel
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:46.220]   170 and that's in a year probably so just to be fair. It's like a lot of the stuff that's booked for our companies
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:51.740]   Books through my account. So it's not just me. Oh, okay. All right. All right
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.660]   I was talking that's when I when I realized that I was talking to someone at hotels.com and i was talking about how much I love
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.940]   Their their service and blah blah blah and and they said yeah travel ages use it all the time
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.940]   They just booked everything for their clients through their through their through that account and then they get they get
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.860]   110
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.860]   They say yeah, they'll have like 100 cruises work too
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.900]   You know that's one of the reasons we get these mac mac mania cruises
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.300]   Is if you book if you if for every I think it's 100
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:18.540]   Uh, or I can't remember what is you get a room a free room for every I don't know 50 rooms, whatever it is you book on the cruise
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:22.460]   So all the speakers get free rooms, right? I shouldn't say this because Andy
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:26.060]   It's probably a little jealous because i'm going Australia November
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:29.100]   I'm going next week
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:34.300]   Oh, that's that's fine because if I if I if I if I joined that cruise leo my feelings
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.740]   We've heard because everybody would want to mob you and talk to you
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.940]   Have you entertained them and I just be the little wallflower now that's so untrue you're such a star
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:49.500]   Andy play the ukulele on stage and to roaring applause thunderous applause
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:55.260]   Maybe it was because you stopped. I'm not saying
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:01.180]   It was for the ukulele perhaps it was for stopping but nevertheless thunderous applause
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:08.060]   Although I will say that I've got I have like a I'm an African fire miles to get a ticket anywhere in the world
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.820]   On American Airlines. I have to but then you have to fly American Airlines
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:17.260]   Exactly, but I've also I have to like buy that ticket sometime like in the next month month and a half
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:22.700]   So I've been through thinking about saying is anybody wants to like get me a hotel room for three days in a place
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:27.180]   I want to go. I've always wanted to go to New Zealand or Australia or Paris
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.340]   I have a stripey shirt and a berry and I could

[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:41.340]   And so uh, they are actually you and I look like seals to sharks
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:48.300]   Well, yeah, I have that sort of like aerodynamic sort of shape. Yes, this is true
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:55.180]   None of those like turbulent turbulence causing like ripples on the front of the chest that you know that would cut down on my uh,
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.660]   That would increase the water resistance. Um
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:03.900]   Uh, and yeah, I'm also sort of the play drives myself by mentioning that
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:12.380]   Yeah, I I'm not as familiar with the beaches of chatham on cape cod as I am with the cream and cone restaurant
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:17.100]   uh home of immensely good fried clams they're on the very very elbow
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.660]   area of uh of cape cod

[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:11.740]   Available on audible good beach book good beach reading good thing to listen to while you're
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.300]   You know eating your frog clams with the cream and cone
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:20.060]   There is also ice cream at the cream and cone by the way, so that's uh is aptly named but gonna need a big a cone
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:22.700]   It's like
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.700]   It's your rice shiner impression

[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:35.740]   Just right what are you gonna do now?
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:42.860]   What a great it's such a good movie, but you know what the book is really the thing I see
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.900]   I am a fan of audiobooks because they're kind of um, you know, it's in between the printed page and the movie
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:53.580]   You're hearing the all the words around the printed page so you get the full book, but you you hear it when you hear it
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.580]   It somehow becomes visual. I know this sounds weird
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:00.460]   But a lot of times I've I've read the book and not seen the movie and I think I've seen the movie because I've seen the book
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:05.180]   In my head and if you I'll tell you if you read or listen to I guess peter bedchley's jaws

[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:10.380]   Uh, it's a dramatized audio version of star wars. I think this came from a national public radio
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.020]   I think they did this
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.340]   Shortly after the movie came out. So it's episode three
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:21.100]   It is dramatized condensed version of it. Yeah, it's quite good
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:26.780]   What skywalk is here?

[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:07.180]   Enough enough said
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:12.620]   Do you want to do an iOS you have you haven't been here so long? We haven't done any iOS tips
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:15.900]   Do you have an iOS tip? Do you want to do an iOS? Do you care? Okay, go ahead. I do so um
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:18.780]   As we've talked about earlier, I travel a lot
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:23.260]   Um and one of the problems that you end up with is that you get onto these Wi-Fi networks and
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:27.260]   The what your messages aren't going through because you know, you're you kind of work
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.580]   Oh, I don't know if I talked about this one before but I'm gonna try it
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.100]   I'm gonna it's important one because I use it all the time. Yeah, so uh
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:39.340]   So essentially what happens is that you are constantly in a situation where you're finding your messages through messages
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:43.740]   There's not going through it. So you know because what the iOS is doing is if you're going iPhone to iPhone
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.100]   It's gonna use the Wi-Fi
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:49.420]   But you what happens is you walk into an airport you walk into a hotel and you're being logged into their little thing
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.580]   And it's waiting for you to go to the website and pay 18 dollars
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:57.340]   So you're so so your iPhone thinks that you are now connected to Wi-Fi and it's trying to send out text message through there
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.660]   But it's not getting anywhere and it's not smart enough to know that
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:05.660]   So one of the things that's really important is to know that you can go into your messages go to iMessage and turn that iMessage off
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:09.580]   And I really toggle this all the time. So if I feel like I'm traveling a lot
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:13.100]   You do want it on because it saves you a lot of money if you overseas
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.340]   So it's very important to turn it on when you can
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:20.700]   Um, so you turn it on um, but when you if you're having if you find that it's stalling constantly
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:26.060]   You know like iMessage is a lot of times when it's doing iPhone to iPhone little blue box instead of the green box
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:30.060]   Um, you're gonna find that it's stalling like just waiting for a long time it the
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:33.260]   Your sms will be much much faster to get to somebody
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:37.500]   Oh, that's good. Um, it just that if you have a limit on your if you're not unlimited sms or if you're overseas
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.780]   It's gonna cost you money
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:43.420]   But if you are but the thing to know is that if you're seeing it stall and you feel like the thing's going slow
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:47.740]   You can always switch you can go to messages and switch to iMessage and just turn off iMessage
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:51.980]   And then it'll go back to sms and then it you know and it'll be much much faster
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:54.700]   Um sending those back and forth. So that's my tip
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.260]   By the way katie
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:02.060]   Is not sleeping. She's enjoying mac break weekly. She's trying to touch your head right now
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.780]   Sam, thank you
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:05.900]   our uh
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.900]   OS 10 tip and dianna co
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.220]   I am going to call it audible
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:15.340]   I'm gonna dispense with the one that I was planning on do since we're talking about the iMessage and messaging in general
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:19.820]   Uh, this is a tip for iChat and messaging the mess new messaging app
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:26.140]   Which I only discovered about a month and a half two months ago when I was trying to debug a problem where for some reason
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:32.620]   The app would just not connect to to any of the iChat servers servers or the iMessage servers
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:38.780]   Uh, and didn't matter if I quit and restart it didn't matter if I killed the helper amp that's invisible
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:41.660]   Just did not work and that's when I started digging through
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:47.660]   Support files and I found out that there is a there isn't an explicit logout of
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:50.300]   iMessage logout of
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.300]   Of of iChat
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:56.460]   Button in the in the app, but if you do go into preferences and go into accounts
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:01.260]   There is a checkbox next to enable this account for each of the different services that you use
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:07.820]   If you just uncheck it wait a couple of seconds and then check it again that will log you out and then back in again
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:10.300]   uh, so what will happen then is that
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:15.500]   The frame I experienced at least seven out of ten times if for some reason you can't log in
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:18.940]   If you just simply uncheck the account then check it back. You don't have to quit
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:24.380]   You don't have to restart you have to do anything like that. It will somehow debam boozle itself and you'll be offering it again
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.980]   Ah, good tip
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.580]   It's good to know and I did mention you can't get messages anymore
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.540]   If you didn't get it when it was available downloadable for the beta
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:37.500]   You're gonna you're not gonna have it on your desktop, but I think we're gonna see

[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.340]   Something okay

[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.020]   They wouldn't they won't escape this way
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:52.140]   This is it taken with a blackberry from greg. Thank you

[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:15.500]   and uh
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:18.220]   Let's see keeping cool and kcmo raven
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.780]   and uh
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.420]   Somebody else let's see I think this needs to be kind of a regular little Samson and me that we kind of love it
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:27.420]   Well, I just I maybe it's just us
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.500]   But I just I can for those of you and a lot of you
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.820]   I mean far more people have tweeted me than I can possibly
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:36.140]   And if you're listening to the show, you're now gonna have to go watch the show to actually see these photos
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:41.900]   So Alex your pick of the week saw okay, I've got an iPhone one and a hardware one and I talked a little bit before okay
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:45.260]   So hardware one I just want to people always ask what are you gonna use thunderbolt for
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.420]   It's that you're gonna use it for that. This is one of the things I'm using it for
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.020]   So what this is is a
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:53.420]   Sonnet came out now. This is the big version. There's a small version of this
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.820]   There's like half the size that I that I'm testing as well
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:01.180]   But what this does is this lets you basically take uh, you know to a thunderbolt connection
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:07.580]   It's got two of them so you can loop through uh and uh connect a regular card to your um
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:14.700]   To your mac uh and so to your to your laptop and one of the things I've been testing is is can I get a whole bunch of cameras going into
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:20.620]   Wirecast and the answer is yes. So this is a black magic quote. What's called a quad car quad card
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:23.420]   And uh, what it actually does is let me ring four
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.140]   uncompressed a HD
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:31.820]   uh video feeds uh into this box which then lets me attach these with one little cable
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:37.980]   Wow, I lapped up and I was able to cut from camera to camera streaming out of wire cast out of them laptop
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:42.300]   So when you talk about like mobile stuff and what what people are talking about in this industry in the industry
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:46.620]   You know the in the media industry video and audio thunderbolt is just taken over
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:51.500]   So anyway, that's the boxes on it and the card is black magic. Anyway, so then though
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:57.420]   How much I suppose is foolish with me boxes like 700 bucks and uh, it's one Alex. It's that that's and that's the big one
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:01.180]   I think it's or maybe 799 7 and then and then the smaller one's like 599
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:06.140]   So it's there's a personal price the card itself is about a thousand dollars, which does the four inputs
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:11.580]   Uh, um, so, you know, it's a little pricey for that box, but remember if the half box works which we're going to test today
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.780]   Um, you're talking about a little briefcase that you can stream
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:20.300]   a four-camera shoot on location with graphics to youtube anyway, so um
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:23.660]   Um, the the software the iOS
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:28.380]   One now that we're getting the political season. Uh, I thought it was I thought it was really cool
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:32.140]   Someone just just this just went up and this is called sponsored by
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:36.700]   So the name of the the app is called sponsored by and what it does is it lets you
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.740]   Um, take a look at all the politicians
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:44.540]   This is whether they're republican or democrat and you can click on them and uh, find out where all the money came from
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:50.860]   So you see those little stickers on them of where uh contributions have been applied to there
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.300]   And and you can and all the logos for all of the companies who have
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:37:00.780]   Um, given money to uh in each each one of these individuals. That's really, um, yeah, so you can show it
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:02.620]   Yeah, do you have an over the shoulder for uh, Alex?
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:09.580]   He's looking for like he can we can do it online. Okay. It's very pretty. Oh, there it is. So so it's very
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:12.860]   It's very nice and um, so what you have here
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:16.460]   So we can say like mit romney here and we can click on this and so you see
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.260]   It's like a last car uniform on a suit
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.020]   But what you can do is I can scroll over here and I can go bank of america and it'll click in
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.180]   I'll say bank of america has contributed
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:31.580]   $398,850. Wow, you know and so you need to know this now because the supreme court said the corporations have no limits
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.820]   Right and what they can donate to campaigns
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:37.420]   So it is a significant amount compared to what they used to donate
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:42.380]   So this is a very valuable. I think and the big thing is most of this data is something you have to eat that is all publicly available
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:50.220]   It's hard to find this makes it, you know very very easy to find you know anybody you're interested in you can drill down into um all of these uh,
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:51.340]   You know
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.340]   All these politicians
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.300]   Has a pack
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.860]   That stuff yeah, I'm not sure it has I guess you can get more
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:01.740]   This has all the major politicians that are running and then I guess you can you can buy more politicians
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.940]   So you can follow
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.500]   Oh, so I see so you can uh you can you know
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:10.300]   It's nice that they have in-app purchases for politicians now. Yeah, exactly. I think that's a great thing
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:18.140]   I'd like to buy that boat. You know that's what they really what they really need is a kickstarter for bills. Yeah, so I'd like to pay a little extra
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:23.100]   So anyway, so let's yeah, what we know the kickstarter for what's the name of this? Um, it's called um uh
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:24.780]   It is called
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:29.340]   Sorry, I just lost it here sponsored by it's a buck 99, you know, it's a coffee
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:31.660]   um and um
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:36.300]   I think it's good for at least a little entertainment, but I think it's important because I think one of the things that that's interesting this year
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:41.580]   As I said is that this is the weirdest political year ever because of all the um
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:45.180]   kind of the unleashed
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:48.780]   uh funding power that right that that has happened in this election
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.020]   So I think it is more important than almost any other time
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:53.740]   Um to uh to at least know
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:58.380]   You know where that money is coming from and yeah, I don't know if it's not it's not falling super packed maybe they will eventually
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:01.180]   But I can't because I think they don't have to
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:06.620]   There's no rules. It's gonna be fine. I imagine that there are other there will be a lot of these kinds of apps
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:09.500]   This is the first one I've seen I'm looking here and I don't see any
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:14.380]   This is the I haven't seen any others that make it easy for you to figure out what's what where the money's actually coming from yeah
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:18.380]   That's that's uh all year round
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:25.580]   Uh contributions and it's sponsored by not supported by but unless someone was sponsored by all one word
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.460]   Huh sponsored by I'm gonna buy it. I phone only
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:31.180]   Andy your pick of the week
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:37.740]   My pick is an update to one of my favorite cameras in the world. This is the go pro hd hero two
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:44.780]   Which was released just a few months ago. I'm waiting for a very important accessory to be released that they announced alongside
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:49.100]   Um those you've probably if you've seen any reality shows on cable cable
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:55.500]   You've seen mythbusters with this strap to their cars or their heads or magro has worn one of these means clapping a
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.220]   3,000 foot radio tower or whatever
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:04.700]   Uh and they're really wonderful little cameras their hd video cameras with a built-in battery. Uh they are uh
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.820]   Also come with this really cool
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:13.180]   Uh shockproof waterproof windproof dustproof housing you're gonna actually submerge it
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:15.980]   To something like 20 or 30 feet don't work just fine
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:19.180]   It takes lots and lots of abuse the actual camera itself
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:24.460]   Is actually sealed inside this as through this fully gasketed thingy here
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:27.740]   And here is the actual camera in
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:36.380]   Uh, and it shoots vid what I love about it is that it is so flexible they decide when they design this they didn't decide to make any
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:43.180]   Uh any guess they didn't decide to make any any predictions or guesses about what specifically someone would want to use this for
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:46.060]   It is for shooting pictures and video
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:48.700]   in extreme situations
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:54.940]   For pretty much any purpose. So it will shoot high definition video this new version shoots 1080p video
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:59.580]   Instead of just 720p it will also shoot still photos this new version does
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:05.740]   Uh 10 megapixel photos instead of just 5 megapixel photos the lens itself is super wide angle
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:11.260]   So you will get like pretty much like 170 something field a degree field of view
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.660]   Uh from from every single shot
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:20.460]   Not not only not only that but there's also uh the you can you can activate it yourself
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.700]   By actually if you're if you're having like photo mode for instance, you can activate yourself
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:29.420]   Just by pushing like this char button up at the top there or you can just set it up for time lapse
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.740]   And we'll shoot up to 10 frames per second
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.940]   Uh for as long as you have storage this has a a regular SD card slot
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.700]   And on the side here it also can power you can also power itself
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:43.260]   Uh from this standard mini usb connector
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:50.220]   So you can put a 32 gigabyte card in there hook it up to like a battery extender and just leave it outside in the yard
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:55.260]   For like three days and have it shoot like five frames per per minute and just get pictures of
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:42:02.700]   Either all of the animals that make their way through your yard in the early morning or the vagrant who might be peeing in your rose bushes
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:07.660]   Either way, uh, it'll be weatherproof. It'll take all those photos. You'll get them there
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:13.180]   Um, this also has hdmi out so you can use it just for as as a regular video camera
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.660]   Uh now what I love about it is that
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:22.140]   My main thing I love about it is that it's also expandable if you look in the back here here is like an expansion slot
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:27.420]   So what you can do is you get these little accessory where they call them backpacks and just snap them on the back here
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:30.460]   And the backpacks also ship with a little extra like
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:36.300]   Larger doors so you can still put it inside that waterproof explosive exposure and kuja
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:40.220]   Uh one of them is like a battery extender another is like an actual lcd
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:45.100]   Uh color lcd viewfinder so if you want to actually be able to see stand behind it and see what you're shooting
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.940]   We're shooting it, but they had they had this really cool thing for 2012
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:52.460]   Uh that the they called the the wifi backpack
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:59.820]   So with this special backpack put onto it. This has full communications video and data via wifi with nearby devices
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:03.260]   So for instance, uh, it comes with this remote
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:07.020]   So obviously if you've got this thing strapped to your head is kind of inconvenient to
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:10.620]   You know turn it on and off like that and make sure you know that it's actually running
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.940]   Uh, this thing will actually you can control the camera via wifi from this thing
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.100]   So whether you're uh, what you've just got it like
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:20.300]   If you're sky dive and you just have it like sort of tag right here
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:24.540]   Or whether you've got it like on the on the railing of the porch outside
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:29.740]   And you're just trying to sneakily take pictures of squirrels as they approach it curiously and look at the peanut butter
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:34.300]   You've smeared all over the railing that there you use that way too. The doubly cool thing though
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.420]   Is that uh
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:41.980]   There is going to be very soon an iOS app and an android app
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:47.260]   So that you can actually use your phone your ipad as a viewfinder for this device
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:53.180]   So you can have this like stuck pretty much anywhere shooting video, but then you can also have your iphone
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:58.300]   You can actually see live video being transmitted from this camera and you're also controlling it from this remote
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:01.180]   Uh, so it really does underscore what I love about it
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.420]   Which is it is there are so many situations in which you would love to get a photo
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.620]   But you have to be physically present in order to make that happen
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.420]   You can't be sitting there for three hours to wait for this thing to happen
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:16.380]   Or you're in this really extreme environment where it's going to be really really difficult to shoot that sort of thing
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:20.540]   With this camera, it's if you're if you're out boating with some friends
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.260]   It's very very easy to like stick this uh
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:24.380]   to
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:28.540]   Submerge those like three feet underwater and be able to watch like all the fish and everything come out
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:31.260]   All the sharks coming in the bite at the the chum that you've uh you've been
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:32.860]   So
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:40.220]   Growing off the side of the the hole you can suction cup it to the side of of your car and be used and as a passenger in that car
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:46.380]   Be using that be using like your phone to judge when you want to start and stop the camera for like really good action shots
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:50.060]   And every time you buy this thing it's like 200 the camera itself is about 300 bucks
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:53.980]   It's discounted a little bit online, but for that money you can buy it in three different packages
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:58.460]   Uh and in one package. It's like it's for like outdoorsy sort of stuff
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:02.540]   Like riding your bike and it comes with like a million different mounts and attachments
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:05.100]   You can figure out a way to attach it to pretty much whatever you want
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:09.660]   There's another kit that's pretty much specifically for using it with cars and it gives you a suction cup mount
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:15.020]   Another little elbow so you can get it aimed exactly the way you want then there's another one that's specifically for water exports
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:20.380]   Uh, so in addition to the standard underwater housing there's a whole bunch of different groups and things that make it to work
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.540]   So the it's the
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.620]   I've often wondered that
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:27.020]   How do you recommend like what people buy for a camera?
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:31.660]   And if someone told me that they had like a 1200 budget, I would instinctively say well
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.500]   Here's a really good like 1200 camera. Here's the sony any x7. That's really really great
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.820]   but part of me would say
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.700]   I would want to talk to them a little bit and then say well why don't you get a
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:46.540]   $700 conventional camera, but also 300 bucks for this really cool durable underwater extreme sports camera
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:51.980]   As I guarantee you they're going to be shots that you're not going to be able to get with like a fragile conventional
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:56.620]   R style camera, but if you have this little thing and you're going on the cruise and you're kayaking
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:46:02.860]   Expedition for the day with your kids you will be happily able to get all kinds of photos and all kinds of video with the
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:07.580]   Hero camera that you can get anything else though. It's a lot of fun 200 300 bucks for the camera
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:12.620]   This back to this Wi-Fi backpack is 100 bucks, but both all these things are discounted online
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:19.100]   Uh really really fun stuff some of the most fun stuff. Uh, having my flick or feed are things I just got from this hero camera
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:24.460]   I'm looking to get one because I'm going to be going in a great great barrier reef when we go down
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:27.980]   Yeah, I'd be really good for underwater purpose. Oh absolutely
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.820]   Yeah, well, I think also if you have kids
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.100]   You know that you can actually it fits into their little hands really well
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:36.060]   And they and it takes them a little while to figure out how to unlock it
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.540]   And if you kind of tape that down a little bit and just handing it to them
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:42.300]   They're not a lot of damage they can do to the camera and they go out and have take lots of photos and and
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:48.140]   Go pro hero too. We reviewed what amazing we reviewed it on before you buy 26 brian bernette
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.540]   Look at this. He put it on his motorcycle
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:53.180]   Uh and compared the hero to the hero to
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:57.020]   Uh, he has a very nice bike and he got great images
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:01.740]   And as you can see they are better. I think better quality on the hero too really fun
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.260]   Really neat. It really is one of those. I really should have this in china
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:08.700]   They make they make like a harness you can actually wear it in the middle of your chest
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:12.700]   And I really wish that I would have had it like when i'm walking under the forbidden city
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:16.780]   Not just not shooting video, but just simply take a picture every like 20 seconds
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.820]   So that even when i'm not thinking that I want to take a picture here
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:22.700]   I've got photographic record of where I was and the things that I saw
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:27.180]   And in case you're asking you can't turn off the red recording led
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:32.060]   So the people don't know that okay. Yes. Yes. I look like a fool with this little box the middle of my chest
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.140]   But yes, it is taking pictures. Unfortunately
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.860]   I'm sorry with a little words. You can probably make it look like a good public places. I'm not going to this
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:42.300]   Um
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:45.820]   Yeah before you buy 26 highly recommended. I want to mention
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:49.100]   Look at that. I mean just some great shots. There's some really good stuff
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.860]   Uh, I want to mention a couple of things in my picks
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:59.420]   I was going to mention just one, but I've got a couple that came up one is people were asking what is the twitter
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:03.820]   Uh client that you were showing those things on the desktop and we've talked about in fact
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:06.140]   I think it was uh, don mccallister who recommended
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:09.340]   Ospora for ipad and
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:14.860]   iPhone and now they have a desktop client for twitter and you're gonna want this Alex when you finally get your retina display
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:19.580]   Because it twitter is not retinized. Maybe it will be by the time you get yours
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:25.020]   But ospora is and it's just a gorgeous, uh, and I think very effective very functional
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:30.540]   Uh twitter app. So I just wanted to mention that it's a couple of bucks in the in the app store
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:37.500]   A highly recommend and then there is a deal right now. Um, I know we're all going to get turned by turn directions and ios 6
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:42.220]   Uh, but the navagon is offering because they realize they're going to frankly be on a little bit of trouble
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:49.020]   And when i was six comes out. I think it's half price like it's like 30 bucks for the navagon, which is a really good turn by turn
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.820]   Navigator that has some very cool
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:54.860]   Features including a cockpit feature
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:49:01.500]   Uh that lets you uh, well, I you know, I i'm not in a car. So I don't know, you know how i'm gonna be able to
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.900]   Make it look
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:09.980]   Oh, I'm sorry. I just set the home address you can download maps for the us and canada for that price. They do have some in app
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:15.420]   Purchases traffic is 20 bucks, uh 3d panoramic views 10 bucks
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:21.180]   Uh, it does by the way use street view and I know you like street view and that's not gonna be part of the ios 6
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:27.020]   I know and that's a big thing. Yes, a navagon will add that radar info so you know where the radar guns are
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:31.660]   And uh, it's offline maps by the way, so that's that's kind of handy
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:38.620]   Um, anyway, it's a it's a very nice navigator and the cockpit put bit mode is very cool, but I don't know if I can show it
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.580]   Uh what it will look like
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:46.220]   But it shows role and yah in your car and stuff and by the way, it's universal
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:49.900]   So you buy it for the ipad and you'll get it for the iphone. That's great, which is which is really nice
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:51.900]   And it's done. It's nice on the iphone
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:54.860]   So a couple of the couple of the cockpits like four bucks extra
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:57.740]   Um, that's called navagon and then finally one other thing
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:04.220]   Uh, and I thank the chat room for this tip mac rumors has a direct link to the messages beta
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:06.300]   for lion
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:11.740]   Now apple can't hide from now who loves how long this will last but apple did pull down the link on its site
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.940]   But if you go to mac rumors and you search for messages beta
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:20.620]   Um, they have a link. I just downloaded it and it is in fact the link to the beta of messages if you should want it
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:22.300]   It's kind of a little bit funky
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:24.620]   Uh, and of course we'll get it sometime in the next few weeks
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:30.140]   Any predictions as before we go as to when we'll get mountain lion and he do you have any inside information?
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:34.060]   I don't have any inside information, but i'm guessing the last week in deli
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:39.260]   The wait till the last possible minute. I think I think they're gonna they're there there's some prop there's some
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:45.580]   Serious problems that i'm aware of that make me think that it's not going to be late
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.420]   But that they're going to need every day that they have right
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.940]   Right
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:50.860]   All right. Well just checking
