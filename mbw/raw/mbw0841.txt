[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.160]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple News.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.320]   It's actually a staggeringly large amount of Apple News. Today, we welcome back to our shores,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.480]   Jason Snell, who was off on assignment. I was in a, I can't disclose where I was, but it was a very
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.640]   large ring-shaped building. Really? Really? You drove all the way down to Cupertino.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.520]   Down to 280. Hey, cool. Well, I want to know what you found out. We'll get to that in a second.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.040]   But first, let's also welcome Andy Inacco from WGBH in Boston and soon to be revealed in Notco.com.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.400]   The Froyo in Cupertino, it's worth the drive. It was worth the flight from the East Coast,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.680]   so I understand very much why. Oh, you show off. I did it go down there.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.120]   The Froyo is good, but the range of toppings that are available. I do like your Canadian
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.320]   teapot hat, however. This is my Pixar like, RenderMan, like walking teapot hat. Yeah, I feel like
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.320]   it's both a tribute to Pierre Trudeau and the Amiga in one. As long as you say Amiga, not Amico.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.560]   Amico. Or Amigo up north, north of the border, and from office hours.global and 090.media.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.520]   Alex Lindsey. Morning, morning. I feel like I should say our champ yesterday, who won $30,000
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.880]   in double jeopardy in our returning champ. Because that's your returning the returning
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   champ desk. Watching too much jeopardy lately. Hello, Alex. Good. Good. Good morning.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.920]   And you have the Rishi Sunak Memorial Ember Cup. I have a couple of them. Yeah.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.840]   Nice. My mother got them for me, actually. She bought me the little one. I was like,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.040]   "But I really wanted the big one." Like, I didn't say it that way. I was like, "Oh, but there's
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.960]   two of them." And then she sent me the other one the next five. But you don't get the tall one.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.680]   No, it's not as the clay one. I got it. I got it too. Yeah. And then Andy's got a plast bottle.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.760]   Mine's a whole band of the people. Mine's a no. Yeah. The thing is, I'm on for two hours every
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.240]   morning. So there's hour one an hour. You need it. And it keeps causing more. I don't stand up.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.120]   It is in fact a staggering lack of self-awareness you're showing by using that cup.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   That was that they accused the new prime minister of Great Britain of Rishi Sunak a couple of years
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.680]   ago when he was shown as chancellor of the ex-checker preparing his economic update statement
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.360]   in his offices with shocking a 180 pound Ember mug on his desk. His tie cost more than that.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.120]   Yeah. It does so. But doesn't that indicate like he is a man of the people? The idea of
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.000]   he drinks so much coffee to get himself through all the work he does during the day that he needs
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.600]   to keep the coffee warm as opposed to, "I've had a special bronze and brass button installed on my
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.400]   desk that beckons man's shoes to meet Diet Coke's upon a silver platter." Good point.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.800]   There are some who have that. Given what I've heard about the Joe at number 10, he probably
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.520]   should keep that coffee mug around. Churchill was always complaining how cold the coffee was.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:16.320]   Coffee. Coffee. I hope my people are like, "T." Coffee. Is there a kid in that tea?
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.800]   Okay. Wow. There's so much to talk about. Yesterday, the arrival long heralded
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:33.920]   finally of Mac OS. I don't even -- Ventura? Ventura. Six. It is. And then iPad OS 16.1.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.080]   And then they're at a step now. I think it's Apple Watch 9.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.920]   Oh, one. And I'm very confused by the whole thing. I'm not -- I have to say,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.480]   I'm not thrilled about the new system preference pane, aka now the control pan.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.000]   What do you think? System settings. System settings. You know what? I'm totally into it now.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.080]   It was a little bit off-putting, but the thing is, it is more natural for me to look -- when we're
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.400]   looking for what are my network settings, what is Ethernet? My first thing is, "Hey, look,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.840]   there's the word. It's called network settings. I'm going to go over there as opposed to here is
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:22.320]   a grid of fun little, you know, placemat icons that might kind of have something to do with the network."
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.520]   So, yeah, I'm into it. I don't know what it does for accessibility. I assume that's a good thing,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.880]   but I trust other people to tell me things about that. But, yeah, most of the switches that have
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.400]   been -- I've been experiencing on Ventura now that I'm using it -- I was going to say 24 hours a day,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.960]   but I can say 24 hours in the past day have been positive if I liked it.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.680]   Yeah. Yeah, I think system settings is bad. I agree with Andy. It's a little like a house that's
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   a new -- got a new coat of paint on it that it really needed, but you go inside and it's still
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.040]   the Winchester Mystery House inside. It is -- System Preferences was really bad and they
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.000]   no sense and they kept sticking things onto it, and it is literally an interface for Mac OS X 10.0.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   Right? Like, it is very old. It's 20 plus years old. So, getting something that's more
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.600]   iPad and iPhone like, it's a good decision, right? It's a really good decision. The problem is
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.720]   everything else, which is, organizationally, I think they spent all the time developing this to
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.760]   get it to move over into SwiftUI and to get this iPhone and iPad style interface on it, but what
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.000]   they didn't do is actually organize anything. And so, yes, if you click on Network, you can get
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.400]   to Network Things, but there are lots of things in weird places where they don't belong. If you
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.680]   look at the scrolling list, it's like almost three dozen items in there. They're not organized in any
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.480]   way. They're grouped together, but at no point can you discern what the groups mean
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.200]   within the groups. They're not organized in any way. Some of them, you click on them and it's a
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.520]   long scrolling list. Sometimes there's a menu that you have to click on and then you go another
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   level down, at which point you actually can't see what level you're on. Are you on the top level
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.960]   or one level down? I would say, in my review, what I said is basically this is an incomplete
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.200]   grade. See me after class. You got to put more work into it because while they gave it a facelift,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.520]   at this point, really, the only advice I can give people is use the search box because that's the
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.800]   only way to find anything. It's kind of in that way for a while, though. I've been doing that for a
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   while with the search box. Yeah. And searching is good and the searching is all there, but what
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.280]   are we doing here? Why is there an index and a list of things at all if all anybody really
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.600]   should do a search? I mean, they could add stuff like you could be able to, that you could favorite
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.840]   stuff or show recent places you've been. Those would be ways that you could make it maybe more
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.360]   friendly. The search is fine, but I don't know why we have three dozen, a list of three dozen items
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.520]   if you can't really use it and you just need to search. So I think they need to do a rethink there.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:01.680]   It mirrors the iPhone, really, right? So is the theory that you're used to it finding stuff in
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.800]   this mishmash, this pile of settings we put together for the iPhone. So congratulations,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.280]   now you got it on the Mac. Well, I think what it got me to think is they actually need to reorganize
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   their settings everywhere. They really do. There's lots of stuff that doesn't make sense there.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.840]   They move things around. But the truth is what happens is you release an operating system every
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.640]   year and it's got new features. And it's not a high priority, but you have to put settings
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.720]   somewhere. So you stick it somewhere and you move on. And then the next year you do that and you do
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.800]   that again. And on Mac OS, they've done that for 22 years. And you end up with this incredibly
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.320]   weird settings in weird places and the settings are inconsistent. Like they have this new feature
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.680]   called Stage Manager on the Mac that's a window arranging thing. And its settings live right next
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.080]   to Mission Control, which kind of makes sense. But the Mission Control settings are kind of like
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.360]   out of the open. And the Stage Manager settings, you have to click a button that brings up a pop-up
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.120]   window where you put those settings in. It's like, why is it like that? Why is it so inconsistent?
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.480]   There's no answer. I get why it happens, which is they don't care every year. They just stick
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.240]   it somewhere. But somebody's got to fix it. If you didn't know system settings existed,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.960]   you probably would never find out, right? Because it's hidden in a weird place.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.640]   Just search for it, right? Like they should make the whole interface at this point,
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.040]   just a big search box. It says, tell me what you would like to do. Because it's also frustrating
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.800]   that this is so iOS that it can't be expanded. It can be expanded down, but not to the right.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.880]   Yeah. Yeah. Every Mac has a widescreen display. And yet you can't scroll. They've got this too,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.200]   like multi-level hierarchy, but you can't ever see it because they've decided to make it a
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.560]   little box of a window still, even though every Mac has a wider screen, which doesn't make sense.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.160]   They're acting like we're on an iPhone screen. Not an Mac screen.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.880]   And the screenshot that you showed in the video version is also a great example of like,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.240]   how do you turn services or the plugins for photos books on and off? And the answer is,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.560]   go to privacy and security. Sure. Scroll past every single privacy and security setting possible
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.000]   to the very bottom where there's a section called others. And it says extensions and profiles,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.640]   they're down there. It's like, it doesn't make any sense. You would never know that.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   Well, that especially because there's no scroll bar. It isn't apparent that you can scroll this.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.520]   So I know a number of people didn't know there was more. Now, of course,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.200]   you're going to get used to it. A lot of the complaint is just because it's not like it used to be.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:36.400]   And that's like I said, I think it's okay that it looks like iOS and iPadOS. A lot of times when
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.280]   people hear me criticizing, they're like, you just don't like how it looks. I actually think
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   it's a good move to make it look like this. I just they had an opportunity here to touch this thing
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.360]   for the first time in 22 years. And one of the big problems with system preferences is you
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.680]   can't find anything. And they put in all this effort to make this new app. And you still can't
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.240]   find anything. And that's the part that makes me angry is like, I hope they I hope they use this
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.400]   as a base on which to build and structure this thing better over time. And I understand that maybe
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.160]   they only really had the time the team working on this only really had the time to get it over
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.120]   into the new house. And now they have to remodel the inside. I hope they do that though, because it needs
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.840]   it. Andy, go ahead. I'm sorry. I get you. No, no, no, I was just going to add to what Jason's saying
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.720]   that yeah, there are always two different factors when you create a really big change to a user
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.880]   interface like this and stage managers is the same way. There's one that people it's going to take
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.360]   a while for people to get used to that this is not that this is not working the way that the way
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   that used to. There's also just learning how it works. And then the third thing is, you know,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.200]   this is the first live fire exercise of this with a wide real human audience. And I'm very,
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:46.320]   very certain. Okay, maybe less certain than hopeful that this follows the same arc as normal user
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.120]   interface improvements of this kind where they will not watch, they will listen, they will get
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.600]   feedback, they are reading their reading every comment, and they're figuring out how to do things
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.760]   better. And settings to be fair is man, I don't I don't know a single piece of hardware that
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.800]   we're settings is not in some way a huge mess like across multiple platforms. I want to I want to
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.760]   connect this Bluetooth device that that this that this device via this streaming box,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.040]   be it a laptop being be it a phone is has already been introduced to. Where do I find that? Well,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.880]   oh, well, gee, here's here's audio settings. No, it's not audio settings. Okay, well, here's
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:29.760]   is it in wireless networking? Is it in hardware? Is it in accessories? And so many different places,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.320]   different devices just put it into different places and you just simply throw up your hands and you
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.800]   just learn that one plus one equals three in this instance. And that's what gets true.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.360]   Yeah, one of the wireless settings is funny. You mentioned that Andy because one of the
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:49.040]   the examples that I use is in the Wi-Fi settings in the network pane. There's this button called
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.920]   advanced. And it's like, well, what is that? What does that mean? And if you click it, it's actually
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:01.440]   the list of all of the known Wi-Fi stations that it's seen that you can you can remove if you want
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.520]   and choose whether you want to auto log in. It used to be at the top level. And now it's hidden.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.280]   But it's hidden behind this button called advanced, which is like, what is that? I might as well just
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.400]   say more stuff. And then at the bottom below this huge list, there actually are a couple of
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.160]   advanced settings that shows you like the MAC address and stuff like that. And it's just like,
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   you know, good luck finding it. And even if you search for it, you're not really going to find it.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.720]   It's I mean, again, it's a work in progress. And this is going to be what I say about stage
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:33.600]   manager too. But in a lot of this, the question is not like it. A work in progress is not fundamentally
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.080]   bad. It's not great, but it's not fundamentally bad. The challenge is that historically, Apple has
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.240]   had a lot of features that they've rolled out and then treated like they're done. And then they walk
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:49.040]   away for a year or two or three or forever. And the problem with these features is if they walk away,
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.080]   they're walking away from something that's not very good. And and I think that's a mistake. So we'll see.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.760]   By the way, they did know Andy because that's one of the howls we heard throughout the entire
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.200]   public beta was what is this? And people saying, Oh, I'm sure it'll be fixed by the time it comes out.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.880]   And it wasn't. And at some point, I think you get into a point where it just pencils down.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.480]   We don't know exactly. Yeah, maybe that's what happened. They ran.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.960]   It's on the bugs. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they ended up doing is remember that Twitter thread that
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   was like in June or July that was just all the weird display bugs and system settings.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.840]   All of those are fixed. I mean, somebody literally sat there and went through that thread and fixed
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.200]   maybe even one person and fix every single bug in that list. So the bugs are gone largely. And
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.000]   that's good. But clearly, that's what they spent their summer doing is make it functional. And it
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.960]   is functional. It's just not very good. And the problem is they have because of the way that they're
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.120]   they're tying together the iPad and iOS and Mac OS, they can't let them sever very far. So you've
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.000]   just released a bunch of stuff. You have to get it out. You know, like you have to.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.080]   Yeah. They can't just let say, oh, we'll wait another month. They have to put it out there.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.160]   And I think I bet we'll see some upgrades in the next, you know, a little bit of time.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.320]   Yeah. I hope so. Let me read you a blog post from a guy, Ricardo Morrie that I read. And I kind of
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:17.440]   resonated with me. The title was a little link, Beatty. My next Mac might be the last.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.480]   But let me read you what he actually says before you think I'm going to say things like Apple
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.440]   can't innovate anymore again. No, it's not that. I actually quite like what most of Apple's doing
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:34.000]   with the Mac hardware wise. The problem is I just can't stand the software anymore. The problem is,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.600]   and this is, I think this to me crystallize it a little bit, there's a troubling,
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:44.400]   ungluing going on between Mac hardware and Mac OS, a substantial difference in quality between the
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.000]   two components that doesn't make me feel what I used to feel in previous versions of Mac OS 10
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.080]   seamless integration. And he says it stems from Apple's desire to simplify the things for themselves
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   architecture wise. Apple Silicon has been a very good success, right? But the terrible decision,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:10.560]   in my view, he says, has been want to bring the iOS look and feel to the Mac. It's unnecessary.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.040]   It's broken many tried and true Mac interface guidelines and has delivered a massive blow to
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.480]   the whole operating systems identity. Yes, no disagree agree?
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.080]   I think that Apple's going a little bit aggressive in that direction. I agree. I don't think this is
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:34.720]   bad as that editorial would make it out to be because honestly there's a Mac OS has been looking
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:41.440]   very, very frumpy for a long time where if you've been using Linux distros and you see exactly how
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.960]   interesting and innovative, but how interesting and modern user interface can look without looking
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.680]   like you're just trying to make an interactive art piece instead of a functional piece of productivity
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.760]   software. And when you see that, oh, God, we're still dealing with the fact that we don't know,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.320]   we don't know if things scroll or not, because Johnny I've decided that that little pill was just
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.000]   too obstructive. It was it would send to his fainting couch every time a scroll bar appeared inside a
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.960]   window. On the other hand, it's if Apple can if Apple does the smart play, which is to think about
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:25.680]   things that work really well on iOS, particularly on iPadOS and figure out how can we make things
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:31.760]   less cluttered on the Mac desktop that way? How can we make app switching so that you don't so
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.840]   that is so natural to to navigate between apps that you don't wind up with just this leaf pile
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.400]   of windows that you have to keep bearing through in order to discover? Is there is there are there
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.680]   ways that we can take things like the AI enhanced app launchers were really I've have
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   app launchers where I no longer necessarily have to care about where I put app icons on my on my
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.320]   on my home screen on my on my phone, because that little deck of here are five apps that we think
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.880]   you want to use right now. And nine times out of 10 is right up there. Wouldn't it be great if we
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.280]   could do that in a Mac environment? Wouldn't be great if it could just figure out that,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.880]   oh, well, he tends to want to have that when he's when he's writing a show doc, he tends to want to
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:22.080]   have the reader wrap on deck someplace handy, but he wants the he wants his Google Docs doc to be
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.840]   the primary window. Wouldn't it be great if it weren't we weren't still stuck in 1998, where windows
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.480]   are just things that get splattered onto a screen and then good luck to you to try and make make
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.400]   mess of that. And I think that taking cues from iOS and iPhone and iPadOS is a good direction for
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.760]   that. So long as it's not they're not trying to make the Mac into a $2,000 iPhone, I'm going to
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.040]   be patient and on board with it. People are always going to be upset with changes. So I
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:55.440]   acknowledge that. And you know, maybe they'll back off on this. The difference in this in stage
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.760]   manager is you you don't have to use stage manager, but everybody has to use preferences.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.880]   In fact, it's the system settings. Probably the first thing you see when you first
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.040]   go into Ventura, the first thing you're going to do is go to settings. And you interact with them
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.360]   at the time that is most stressful for you, right? It's when you need help, you need to fix something
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.960]   that's broken. Something's not working right. You know, you need to change something about your
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.720]   computer. So it should be something that I think more care is taken. Maybe a graduate student,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.440]   just to write a paper, you know, like here's here's a here's a pile of things we have to have
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.240]   settings for. Let's come up with a theme. A scheme of organization. Some member all
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.960]   early days of the web, they were, you know, in first decade, let's say they were like we I taught
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.520]   a class at UC Berkeley that had a we use the book Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug and it's all
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.240]   about information, information architecture, right? And it feels like what somebody at Apple needs
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.480]   to do or they could get a freelancer to do or whatever is have somebody actually look at every
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.880]   single setting on the Mac and honestly on the iPad and the iPhone and organize them in ways that
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.040]   make sense in chunks that make sense that there's a natural flow for because not everybody is
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.960]   comfortable searching or knows what to search for. And so and maybe they need to think about a
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.920]   simplified settings app that has an advanced mode and they keep it simple for most of their users.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.600]   But to Andy's point, I think, look, I mean, there are a lot of people who've been using the
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.200]   Mac a long time who don't want it to change and don't like this direction. It's going and that's
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.600]   okay. And Apple definitely has software issues. But I think Andy's point is right. And also,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.960]   let's throw into it. More people use the iPhone than use the Mac. The potential for growth in the
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.400]   Mac is coming from people who are familiar with Apple via the iPhone. And so having a family
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.480]   similarity there is good. Also, I would argue the more crossover between the iPhone and the iPad
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.320]   and the Mac is good for the Mac is remember in the 2010s when they would roll out brand new features
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.520]   for the iPad and the iPhone and the Mac either wouldn't get it or would get a really broken version
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.000]   of it that would never be improved. Like that doesn't happen anymore. And the reason is Apple
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.480]   has pushed them together. You could overdo it and they have lots of other issues. But
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.320]   I don't think that the other platforms are the problem. All right. And I think that I think
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.160]   they're continuing to pull them all together so that we all have one experience across all of
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.000]   these things. You open them up and they're all going to be the same and they're all going to be
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.520]   similar. And right now we're still in that kind of still trying to figure out how to get them all
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.560]   to look and work together. But the fact that they're all starting to look the same and they're all
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.920]   working together with continuity with all the all the other things that are adding is really
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.640]   interesting. But it's going to take work to get it all all pulled together. But I really like the
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.600]   fluidity one that you can see it coming. It's not quite there yet. There is a cautionary tale here.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:59.200]   Microsoft stumbled horribly when they decided to take Windows Windows 7 and make it a more
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:05.040]   tablet interface with Windows 8. And it was a horrific failure which they had to backtrack on.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.000]   Eventually they did it over a very short period of time. Apple's been doing this for a decade.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.360]   Like you know it's not like Apple's been slowly like adding little bits and
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.600]   little jump and then we absorb it and then we do another jump and we all absorb it. But it's been
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:27.760]   happening for over a decade. The problem Microsoft had with Windows 8 in my opinion was not so much
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:34.400]   the change but it was unpredictable and you couldn't figure out where things were. They hid stuff.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.720]   And that's always a risky thing to do. In fact like hiding stage manager right. It's off by
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.840]   default right. It's not on. Yeah. Yeah. Off by default. Is that do you think there there may be less
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.720]   than proud of their new child? Andy? Oh, space is spaces is not by default either. Well that's true.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:58.320]   None of those organization things are. Are they? Really? Yeah. I think they appreciate that. Oh my
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.640]   god if they just drop somebody into into stage manager the confusion the howls the yeah the
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.400]   the tech support questions. How do I downgrade back to to the previous version?
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.120]   Because it really it's something where you have to opt in. You have to volunteer for this
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.160]   experience. And so I think that was very very smart. What I was I was though very very surprised
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:24.240]   that you that if you enabled it you weren't immediately taken to a beautiful little in line.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.120]   Apple produce what's going on. Here's how here's the theory behind it. Here's how here's how things
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.800]   move in and out. I've been again if I've with all 24 hours of extended experience I played with the
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.360]   betas but again I only have one Mac and one iPad that could use stage manager so there's no way
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:46.880]   I was installing betas on that on those things. But I'm it's the the confusion for me is that
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.680]   I'm is at a lower end than I thought it was going to be. And the possibilities that I'm seeing about
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:58.240]   how this could keep my desktop cleaner. I'm liking up rather I'm encouraged by what I see. I don't
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.360]   think I know about enough to like it yet but yeah if you just drop me into this and suddenly
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:10.240]   there is this deck of of crackers on the left side of my screen and apps and apps I keep I keep
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.800]   switching from I keep command tabbing from one app to another and they just simply disappear from
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.680]   the screen. I would not want that happen on a deadline day. It does kind of look like a deck of
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:27.200]   crackers that you mentioned it. Cracker manager now it's cracker manager. It's it's it's it's like
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.120]   you're at your your your aunt's house and there's that plate of crackers that has like
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.360]   little slices of pepperoni on it. And yeah that's that's what I thought. Yes. That's
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.600]   manager. I mean I've been using stage manager this summer and I love the idea because I think the
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.960]   idea is it's very rare a Mac user let's say the average Mac user has like eight windows open at
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.760]   once. They're probably not using all eight right. They're probably only using a a couple two three
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.520]   of those and then maybe there's another task where they're using another two three of them and
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.280]   then there are another couple where they're individual and like the idea is you decrease
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.920]   your cognitive load by having that stuff kind of be off out of you just in the little crackers on
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:08.400]   the side when it doesn't matter. It's like they're like canopays. They have little yes they're little
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.840]   things on top. A dollop of cheap window is a dollop of something on top. There's a pimento loaf and
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:20.880]   maybe some puddles in a can and they are and they are actually little piles of things. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.640]   So really is a canopate interface. So the problem with stage manager on the Mac right now is it
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:32.880]   does feel unfinished and Andy has already hit on some of the issues which is like there are
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.720]   gestures and keyboard shortcuts to move around in spaces and full screen mode and yet a lot of
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.200]   those are missing from stage manager and I just want to be able to swipe and move between stages
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.520]   and instead it's like well no you need to command tab to an app that's in a different stage and
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:57.600]   then it moves and then the other I think sin that it commits is often I am clicking on an interface
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.800]   element for a link or you know to another web page or something like that and it just moves me
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.520]   to a different stage with a Safari window in it and it's not what I want and there's no keyboard
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.120]   shortcut that I can detect to say no open it here and I realize maybe there's some API stuff that
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.240]   they're working on with third party developers but the bottom line is I found myself spending more
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:26.240]   time managing where my windows went than I was ever going to save and for anything that's claiming to
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:33.600]   save me time if the net of managing the thing is more than the time it's saving me it's gone like
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.160]   I turned it I turned it off because it's like I am spending way more time moving windows around on
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.120]   my screen and my job is not to move windows around on my screen I have a terrible confession
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.400]   to make I'm sitting there with my brand new M2 MacBook Air in my lap watching
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:56.560]   with Glee as the Chicago Bears the Bears defeated the Pats on Monday Night Football thinking I
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.360]   really should try this stage manager thing I really should I really I'm going to need to talk about
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:08.480]   it tomorrow and I just couldn't bring myself to turn it on I had on the iPad I had the public beta and
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.160]   so I kind of knew what I was missing promise I have and I bet you most people now have
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.880]   a sensible way of operating on both the iPad on the Mac with with using workspaces and
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.240]   swiping you know right and left and stuff and it and it just all makes sense to me I don't feel
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.120]   the need for it maybe it makes more sense on the iPad but I really don't feel a need for it on a
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:38.720]   Mac I'm not I'm not so much into it on the iPad maybe it's because I have less space for one thing
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.960]   there there's less space and also when things start to overlap that's a big problem even on my
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.080]   even on my even on my 12.9 inch like iPad Pro that's a big problem having to
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:57.920]   it's I like I actually like slide over I also I like what they've done with it in previous
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.400]   editions because it's very very easy to do what things are very very appropriate for what I do
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:08.560]   in the iPad version and I just yeah if I need a little thing I can open it up and yeah I
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:15.120]   I mean I I think that tiling is yes it tiling windows got off to a bad start with windows 1.0
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.760]   let's acknowledge that let's put that let's let's let's say that but the thing is there times when
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   on smaller screens the ability to say two thirds of the screen is for the thing I'm writing one
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.480]   third of the screen is for a message a slack that I need to take keep an eye on or even just some
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.840]   information I need to copy from I don't have to worry about dragging something so such that
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.120]   something is now being covered by something else so I don't it wasn't really intuitive for me
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   I'm keeping it on as the right of passage but when I'm actually doing stuff in the iPad I switch
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.600]   it off and switch back to the old way because it's it's not it's I haven't figured it out
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:58.480]   you did a good full review of Ventura on six colors calm Jason yeah thank you you also
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.520]   you know Andrew Cunningham taking over from Syracuse Syracuse so yeah yeah did his whatever
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.960]   ever it is 38 page yeah you know some of us choose to write five thousand six thousand words and
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.280]   some of us have 20,000 word thrust upon us I remember Syracuse it was always like yep the next day
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:23.840]   after he filed just like a zombie you know it's like that works yeah oh yeah no and I think Jason
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.240]   can attest to this like yeah if we we we we go out to dinner about once a month or so and for
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.640]   like three months beforehand that's all the table conversation would be of like what
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.200]   the thing is like it's it's supposed to be paging but it's not paging and you think it's
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.120]   paging it's trying to use but they decided to do their own custom version of this and I'm like
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.000]   oh my goodness this is this is it's it's sometimes it is fun seeing the sausage being made as long
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.720]   as you're not the person making the sausage yeah that's that's exactly it yeah it's it's you know
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.280]   Ventura I find generally inoffensive there are some good things and some bad things that
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.880]   incomplete features yeah I mean the well I mean some OS updates are harmful right where they
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.000]   change your interface out from under you and you feel really bad about it and you're like what
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.880]   where's my stuff or it really breaks compatibility and we've had a few of those in macro s updates
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.800]   recently this is not one of those it feels very much like the last OS except with a few new features
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.920]   some of those features are really good like reason to update to this is do you have a family with
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.840]   whom you would like to share photos can't wait to use a single library yeah across iOS iPADOS
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.600]   and Mac OS in the photos app with shared photos it is there and it's great and it's reason enough
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.480]   just for that also continuity camera do you complain about the quality of your webcam
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.600]   you're by the way you should say you're using continuity continuity camera right now for those
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:48.320]   of you watching video reveal the video version of this this is your iPhone 14 yeah this is an
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:54.800]   iPhone 14 pro and you're on the wide angle lens and i am on the wide lens because that's the highest
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.760]   yeah the well they call it the main camera now right oh it's not the ultra wide so that's
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.440]   ultra wide is lower quality and then and also you can turn center stage on and use it and then
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.640]   your camera is just really the potato yeah it's just the same as if you were using the center stage
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.000]   on the studio display but it's got you know it's got portrait mode in it oh wait a minute let's
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.840]   see let's see that so you turn the blur on the background that looks what do you think Alex you
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.760]   king of king looks pretty good looks pretty good definitely got a lot better his hair is not
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.120]   bleeding this is iPhone portrait mode for those who are watching the video which means it's it's
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.280]   got it's got the multiple cameras in the light are censored to make a very smart mat instead of
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.080]   a dumb mat like a fake portrait mode would be and they got the studio light look at me it looks good
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:44.800]   pretty nice and all of that will work on that really good camera or or honestly if you've got
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.400]   an iPhone 13 or 12 or 11 or 10 they're all much better than the laptop yeah it's better than your
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:33:00.000]   webcam and yes you can use center stage oh it's zooming into your eyes and blue gets sucked into
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.800]   this not so good this is a better camera so on the on the plus side you do look like one of those
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.560]   like old timey like studio glamour like movie stars looks pretty damn good you can't see any
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.200]   the details on your face quite so much yeah you look like Rita Hayworth it's fantastic there you go
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.720]   so i wonder but i i just want to ask you're right but it is a lot you're about you're about to be
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.960]   assumed bobbly and yes that's a good that's a great feature other than the fact that you had to
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.720]   find a mount for it belkin is working on mounts for laptops i think it's out now and they're working
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.760]   on one for desktops as well that's actually what i'm using but it's like camo or e-cam does it
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:42.080]   cat is it compared to those yeah so it is uh it is way better than camo which is a third party app
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.480]   that lets you use your iphone camera as a webcam on your mac because of the home field advantage
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.320]   right because apple's the platform owner they have baked this in camo you have to open your
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.360]   iphone up you've got to launch the camo app you've got to stick it up try not to touch it somewhere
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.040]   where the camo app goes away and then the screen stays on with the camo app on it as you use it and
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:07.920]   so it uses more battery and apple's thing like literally if your phone is near and it doesn't
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.040]   need to be connected right it could be Wi-Fi no this is this is wireless wow uh it's a continuity
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.640]   feature and it is automatic and there's no interface for it on the iphone you just say i want to use
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:25.280]   it and it starts working so it's it there's none of that like open an app the downside is apple thinks
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.840]   that cameras don't need settings other than center stage on off uh and portrait mode on off
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.640]   and it's too bad because camo is one of people watching the video version this will know i have a
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:43.680]   very wide angle here wider than it needs to be um and that's because i can't crop this image
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:48.800]   where's what camo yeah i can make it a little bit closer the opal camera that i've been using you
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.640]   can zoom in a little bit and apple it's too bad apple doesn't put that in the ui i would that would
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.200]   be a feature request i would make is if you don't want to do it apple let third party developers do
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.160]   it because it would be really nice if i could take continuity camera and set a crop or or a
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.040]   camera move or something like that and right now you can't do any of you tried the webcam settings
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.120]   third party app with it i wonder if it i wonder if it should work it's really old yeah that there'll
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.840]   be need to be a new one but but there's i hope that will happen because keep in mind this is a actually
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:25.680]   48 in this case 48 megapixel camera like i can crop it with no loss in quality i am
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.760]   positive of that i would like to be able to do that manually i get that that's a kind of a power
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.520]   user feature but what are we doing here well you're setting 1080p for a 4k camera so you could easily
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:42.160]   uh do that and still preserve the exact same quality totally um i want to take a little break
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.280]   i want to talk more about ventura but yeah that's impressive that's it and i have to say the fact
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.480]   that it's just there and on if you've got a iphone nearby it works is use your old iphone if it's
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.160]   in a drawer somewhere as long as it's 10 i think 10 or later yeah um or maybe it's 11 or later but
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.800]   your last iphone if it's not being used you have a good webcam in a drawer just update it to to the
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.440]   latest o s and it will be a very good webcam for your mac and you suggest the one x camera as the
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:17.040]   best one yeah i mean otherwise you're basically using center stage can you use front facing camera
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.400]   no i don't think so you have to use the back camera yeah that's a good one yeah all right wouldn't
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.200]   be wouldn't be awesome if you could use the front camera and also use this front screen as an external
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.360]   display for your mac so that you could see you here that would be your conference window and the
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.160]   camera and you basically have eye contact that would be amazing let's let's make down a feature
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.320]   request Andy let's get it in that's a great idea file reader in your review you also demonstrate
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:53.440]   uh what do you call that the the look down at your desk oh desk uh desk view thing yeah it's uh you
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.920]   know it's clever they're using the ultra wide at that point to get a very very wide view and then
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.880]   look down on your desk and invert it and de-distort it and make something that you can like show people
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:09.120]   like the documents on your desk this looks pretty good it works the app is really good it looks really
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.760]   good the problem is nobody ergonomically has that kind of desk space in front of their device so if
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.120]   you're using a laptop you gotta push your laptop like three feet back if you're using an iMac or
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.840]   something you got to push the iMac way back on your desk and and so it's not you know it's not
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.280]   going to be super well used but it's really well made it's a very fast responsive app it's it's
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.880]   it's done as an app so that you can use it with screen sharing in something like zoom uh as if
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:43.120]   you were scaring a presentation except you're actually sharing your desk and uh it works really
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.920]   well it's just i i don't think it's very practical just the sheer physics of it you've got a clear
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.800]   enough space and and and the shot that i did i mean it's like you're seeing the very edge of my desk
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.880]   and and i would have had to shove my monitor way back in order to get uh more and with laptops it's
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   kind of a joke right you have to be you're so far away from the people your video conferencing with
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.280]   and from your keyboard um to in order to have enough desk space to show anything it's sort of silly
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   i will point out is correcting for distortion for your notebook but as a result because your
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.080]   hand is slightly above the notebook oh yeah your wedding ring has now turned into a pyramid so
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.680]   you get like alien arms yeah you're using it do not put your hands in the shot it's really creepy
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.440]   great yeah because uh i guess because of the distortion correction is the right yeah objects
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.040]   may be shorter than the ace yeah yeah fingers may be a weirder than they appear yeah you know you
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.880]   will you definitely get e t hands if you use and i wasn't sure i thought maybe you had weird hands
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.360]   but then i looked at your wedding ring and i figured it must be a circle my my hands are normal hands
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:52.960]   leo they're normal hands i don't have e t hands okay e t fingers uh let's take a little break lots more
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.360]   to talk about i do want to talk about the shared photo album i want to know about that and uh any
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.480]   other features of ventura and we are just getting started because there's also ipad o s
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.680]   16 i think 16 one actually right they pushed out an update to that and
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.280]   and um and that's just the beginning there's so much more because you have the new ipad
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.600]   yeah there's new ipads too on top all that if high season leo this is our prime right now this
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.120]   is it we can just spread this out and then i have some legitimate questions i think i have
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.560]   i have a reputation for buying something at the end of life uh i bought the mac cube
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:40.080]   and they got it home and then saw the news that they discontinued it like five minutes after i
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.640]   bought it but but just think of it this way you got it before it was gone i did and i wish i still
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:51.120]   had it honestly because that was historic however uh as you know i talked about it last week board coffee
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:59.600]   directly into my 14 inch m1 macbook by the way there's the m1 right there right right above the
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:05.120]   fried chip where the coffee short-circuit of the track bed and made a mess of the motherboard i
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.560]   gave it to berg to try to fix it and this is what i got back uh it can do your uh you got to do your
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.760]   ip apple self repair program right it still smells very much like coffee in fact that's what the
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:22.080]   repair guy when i brought up the apple store said you know i still smell coffee usually that means
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.880]   it's a chance to really soak in and i'm thinking this is a tier four up fix i said a tier four fix
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.760]   that sounds bad he says that's a $1,300 repair because we're going to send this to apple and
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.840]   they're going to put you a new live app board in there and so they call they call they call
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.440]   they call that a motorcyclist it's nothing but donor parts donor parts i wouldn't even donate
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.080]   these parts i think these are this is it it's done you can turn you can turn that screen into a
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   really nice external display yeah actually i think berg's doing that as a matter of fact as we speak

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:14.080]   uh okay let's talk about the shared photo album because that came to everything right came to
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:24.480]   yeah ventura ipad o s and even that old i phone o s 16.1 yeah ventura yeah so good tell me how it
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.440]   works it took them what what they did i cloud photos like eight years ago and my first question
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.200]   was so can i share this with my wife and they're like mmm and i thought that meant like check in
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.360]   next year and it was no it was check in seven or eight years from now um i did actually have a
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.840]   conversation with people involved with photos and they said the problem is what we don't want to do
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.480]   is release a feature where the only people who benefit are people who want to share everything
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:54.080]   completely and that means we need to come up with a way to do sort of like more intelligent sharing
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.960]   because i think of it now is basically saying okay my daughter and my son are in college
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:06.720]   they do not want to share all their photos no they don't thank you i can assure you they do not
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.520]   that because however when we're yeah right but when we're together or like if my daughter's at the
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.920]   beach and she wants to send some pictures of the beach you want to let them be able to contribute
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.880]   and and actually maybe even have a suggestion like hey i saw you were with your family here are the
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.600]   photos from that do you want to throw these into the shared library so in in the last eight years i
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.320]   guess they've been building this feature uh but i can complain about it a lot but let's just say
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.040]   it's here now and it's actually very good because you can choose a uh you can choose exactly what to
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.680]   contribute you can say i don't want to contribute anything except manually you can say i want to
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.880]   contribute everything or everything from a certain date uh it'll suggest you can set like people that
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:50.800]   it recognizes and say these people if they're photos of them i want to have that it's suggested that i
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:57.280]   donate those into the library um it's very thoughtfully designed you can add or remove things at any time
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:04.480]   the only real quirk is whoever creates the library it goes on their iCloud storage it's not a big deal
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.400]   if you're in a family because you have a shared iCloud account but you don't have to be in an iCloud
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.240]   family to join a shared library you can invite somebody so like my mom is not in my iCloud family
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.880]   but i could invite her to our shared library i wanted to she has to obviously have an apple device
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:25.600]   uh and does she have to have the latest ios uh ipados or mapOS yes that is the catch is that you have
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:32.480]   to be on 16.1 ios or ipados or ventura to get this feature but it is yes otherwise you won't see the
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.960]   shared library it'll it'll be they'll get the invitation all your devices right so if you update
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:42.080]   your ipad but not your iphone and then you contribute a bunch of your photos on your ipad into the
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:47.120]   shared library and your iphone is not on 16.1 it will no longer see those photos because they're
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:53.040]   not in your library anymore they're in the shared library and you can pull them back but um you'll
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.600]   have to do it from your ipad so this is really a feature you should not use unless all the devices
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:05.120]   that you care about are on the latest os but if you do that it's great like i i so my wife and i
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.600]   uh do a calendar every year and we do a christmas card every year and you want to go through all
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.680]   the photos for the year but she's got a separate apple i'd do than me so what ends up happening is
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.720]   in december sometime i plug her iphone into my mac and we import all of her photos for the last
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.960]   year into my library so that then we can sit down and pick the photos we want to choose for the calendar
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.000]   and for the the christmas card and uh that's done now we don't have to do that anymore because she can
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.720]   contribute her photos into the shared library and then we all and i can too and then we all have access
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.120]   to that it's a and she doesn't need to use my computer anymore either she can use her computer
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.160]   because she'll see my photos too uh which previously she had to use mine because it was the one logged
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:53.360]   in with my apple id because i had imported her photos so it's a it's gonna be really good as it rolls
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:48:00.160]   out and as people get used to it um i i yeah i think it's a really great feature so i could add all
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.760]   of my photos to the shared library uh obviously no one wants to do that but it wouldn't take up any
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.800]   storage on their i cloud it's just it's just a duplicate from my iCloud yeah if you're if you're
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.520]   not in the family because if your family it's all shared right but if you're not in the family um
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:24.000]   and you contribute it actually leaves your library out allotment and enters their library allotment
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.960]   oh okay it's like if it's leo started it and then other person outside
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.480]   donates a gigabyte of photos it counts toward your gigabyte and not
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.880]   toward theirs important to remember yeah okay and i didn't mention actually one of my favorite
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.240]   features and another little thoughtful feature apple did is you know those little toggles in the
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:46.160]   camera app on the iphone where you can say live photo or not or raw or not or whatever there's a new
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:52.800]   one that is shared or not so you can turn sharing on for a while and share a bunch of photos you shoot
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.360]   and then you can turn it off and then the photos you shoot don't go so you choose where the photos
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.240]   you shoot on your iphone go whether they go to the shared library or they don't so i
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.280]   upload all my photos both the iCloud and to google's photos google has had this feature for some
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:13.520]   time in fact i've used this feature to it's a little simpler it doesn't work quite the same way
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.600]   but whenever i take a picture of lisa my wife it automatically sends it to her and adds it to her
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:26.800]   library i guess um this is a little bit more elaborate a little bit more capable and there are
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.760]   some more caveats about it so that you should be aware of it i actually doesn't add it to the
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.360]   library just shares it with her so there's a folder she has a shared folder on her google photos
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.320]   that has all the pictures i've taken right and i think that's a good point too to say that apple
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.240]   has previous it's like what why is this different from previous sharing things because you could
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.040]   share an album and there were other like iCloud links you could share like the shared albums weren't
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.440]   full quality um and then you would add them to your library and you would have a lower quality
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.640]   version of what was shared with you um the iCloud links that you've been able to share from ios the
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.840]   last few years are full quality but again you're copying it into your library and it's also in
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:12.720]   their library and they don't connect this feature it's literally instead of one library you have two
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.440]   libraries you can display in the interface you can say show me just mine or show me the shared or
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.360]   put them both together and then there's a little badge on the shared ones that indicates it's in
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   the shared library but they're truly shared if you add a keynote or a keyword if you edit uh
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:34.720]   add a title edit the photo the edit goes everywhere now keep in mind your originals are always there
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.600]   because it's still an iCloud photo library thing but uh if if you're cleaning it up like if you've
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.120]   got one person in your family who's like well i'm going to clean up this photo they can just clean
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.800]   it up and then you see the cleanup and then you can use that uh and and deletions you can remove
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   something from the library uh and you can delete things but uh if you delete things they go in a
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.680]   shared deletion bin so if somebody deletes things that you don't agree with you can kind of undelite
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:05.040]   them and if somebody tries to yank a photo back i think you have an opportunity in certain cases to
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:11.280]   somebody tries to delete your photo you can bring it back to your library they thought of all of
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.160]   these kind of instances of potential tug of war is in the library so it's yeah it's a really
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.840]   it for all the time it took for them to do an obvious feature it is a very well thought out feature
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:27.680]   yeah we hope we have to hope so that happens to have a really great track record on on this
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:33.200]   sort of stuff where it's like oh i honestly thought that i was just simply allowing giving
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.560]   myself the power to access my music or access my files or whatever else where i didn't realize
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.720]   that making clearing up space on my 128 gigabyte iphone would also delete it from my 10 year old
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.760]   library okay thank you what what i can tell you is i've been using iCloud photo library since the
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.440]   start because i wrote a book about it it's like it's like Jason why do you do it it's like well
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:58.480]   because i wrote a book i i had no choice uh i wrote a book about it for take control books you can you
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:03.760]   i have to do a new version now but iCloud photo library has been solid from the start and the
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.800]   beautiful thing about this feature is it is literally another iCloud photo library and all they're
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:13.440]   doing is showing you both of them and letting you toggle um and that's what gives me confidence in
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.320]   this feature because it's not it does not feel like some weird new thing it feels very naturally
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:25.040]   an extension of the thing that they've had for seven or eight years and that works very well
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.800]   yes you should probably have a computer somewhere that's set to download all images in your library
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.000]   and back that thing up you should do that i'm a little concerned that i'm gonna screw it up
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.960]   uh google so i've i just shared for instance just to see how hard it was on google so i go into
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:48.640]   google photos i want to make a shared library that i send to my son so i said every picture i have of
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:55.360]   henry going back all to practically the beginning it says here's the link i sent it to henry it stays
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:00.000]   in my library it's just a shared google photos it doesn't have any of this weird moving stuff from
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.760]   here to there every time i take another picture of him it's added to my shared photo library um i
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:13.600]   think that's a better way of doing it to be i it's at least clearer in my mind well it is clearer but
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:19.040]   the problem is you lose the power of having it be a common uh space he can add to it but although
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.120]   you can make shared libraries right everybody can add to as well that feature exists that feature
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:28.160]   exists on photos already right that you've been able to yeah share a library or share an album and
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.520]   have people add it to their library if they want uh separately as a copy all along this is like
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.400]   the next step which i really think people who want this feature will know that they want it people who
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.760]   don't want it will know that i think it's obviously it's primary use cases in families and it's probably
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.800]   partners who are taking pictures of their of their life and their kids and together and it doesn't
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.840]   make sense that i've got pictures of us on the beach when i from my camera and my wife has pictures of
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.560]   us on the beach from her camera and we never see the other pictures that's dumb or we have to manually
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.920]   share them uh so that's the use case you should be with somebody you're close to
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:07.760]   and a hundred percent and if it somehow disappears from your library somebody you can go to and say
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:13.200]   can i get that back yeah and like i said uh there's there's a there are limitations there right you
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:19.280]   can't they can't destroy your your picture that you contributed um i think i think it can get thrown
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.960]   in the in the deletion bin but it is not permanently deleted at that point and i think you get an
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:30.640]   alert that says um this thing is being deleted you want to copy it back to your library so they've
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.800]   tried to think about all of that stuff but it is i mean this is not something you invite random
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:40.560]   people to this is not and you can only have one so that's important it is just only have one i
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:46.000]   couldn't have one for every kid like here's one i have with abby here's one i have with Henry no it's
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.960]   a family album really it really is i mean it doesn't have you don't have to be an iCloud family member
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:56.000]   to be that but yes that is absolutely and you can do it with multiple people so i could say here's
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:02.400]   all the pictures i have of of of the three other people in my family or whatever here they are
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.760]   okay and then everybody just select and it'll let you select that and actually recognize like oh
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:12.960]   you took a bunch of pictures of your son do you want to throw those in the family shared library
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.920]   and it'll do that automatically when you say yes i think i like those will system better to be
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.320]   else yeah i mean it's not for every use case but i think i will tell you from my use case over the
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.160]   last decade plus that i've been managing photos on my mat i guess two decades almost now because my
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:35.120]   daughter is 20 um this is exactly what we want at least for my wife and i whether my kids will ever
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.440]   want to participate in this or even if i want to ask them i don't know like do they want to
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:44.000]   look at a photo library with their baby pictures in it probably not but my wife and i will love it
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.640]   wait till they get older they might yeah i know exactly that's that's why the features like this
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.400]   are so important there's because they have to be so long reaching i mean as it as it happens i was
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:56:01.440]   my uh uh my aunt died in her inner 90s but my my favorite relatives in the world she was wonderful
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:07.520]   and uh of course you go to you go to the wake and the family puts up all these all these boards of
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:14.000]   all these old photos and stuff like that and it's like half of the like i'd say one fifth to one
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.320]   quarter the conversations in that room where i don't have that photo how how how does who has that
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.040]   photo can i get a copy of that photo and these are the things that like get lost and so the idea
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:28.560]   of having one permanent sense of like a visual truth for the family is going to become more and
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.160]   more important it's going to be the the company that really really cracks this is probably going to
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:39.280]   be the one that makes it as easy as possible as ecumenical as possible and probably as the least
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.040]   clever solution possible the idea that here's just a bucket that we can allow other people to
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:48.000]   access to that makes it easy to archive things not just the not just uh be able to flip through
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.920]   stuff on our phones but to make sure we always have the best quality of this available so yeah
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:59.600]   this is this is a non-trivial thing i joke about uh apple i i do i am gun shy about trust about trusting
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:07.040]   apple with like uh library data unless i've got an air gap between the apple service and a backup
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:12.800]   of it i mean an absolute absolute air gap because i want to be able to spend an afternoon of cussing
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.440]   and and shaking my fist and restoring things the way they were if apple tends to screw it up but
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.160]   but it's not but it's not an easy thing to do and i'm glad to see that they're trying to do something
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:27.920]   better than what they have had available before. Alex what what do you use it or does it seems a
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.640]   little over complicated and i'm very nervous about stuff moving from one library to another
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:38.240]   i that scares the hell out of me i i think i'd be more interested if it copied it yeah just you
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.520]   know as as like when i when i heard like it's gonna move it i'm like well i don't want to do that i
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.160]   don't want that so as i immediately just like like stopped looking at it when it was like when i
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.320]   felt like it was gonna move the file okay but conceptually i get the idea that moving is scarier
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:55.680]   than copying but literally what you're doing is you're moving it from one i cloud library to the
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:01.120]   other iCloud library both of which you have full control over so there was an option i just like
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.560]   all my stuff to be on my library like like my i i have i just i like but it is so so my
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:13.840]   it is it is it it isn't i mean like i just i would be a hundred percent in if i had a button somewhere
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.600]   in the preferences that just says copy to the folder like i i'm fine with it having two copies
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:24.720]   like i'm fine with putting as a pain whatever i need to pay to have the copy where where it was
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:29.600]   originally and like and then one in the new version i'd be a hundred percent behind that if i have to
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.320]   pay an extra nine ninety nine a month or whatever i do that i don't want to i don't want to i don't
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.760]   want to move it from one to the other i feel like this is like i i get i get it but i feel like this
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.400]   you're you're our dr mccoy now congratulations because i feel like this is the same argument as
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:51.200]   if you step into the transporter and are beamed down to the planet is it you down there or or did
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:57.760]   you just get disintegrated and it has been put down could you emiric in our chairman saying well
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:03.600]   can you duplicate it in your library first and then move the copy can you like have a folder
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:08.000]   like a backup i think that it would be interesting to live that way but you could
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.240]   probably live that way where you were you were duping things putting them in the library and
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:17.040]   not just done it really nice what i want to do for me though is i just want to say i just don't you
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.560]   know my whole thing is i just want to know that can move my libraries around and do whatever i'm
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.600]   going to do them there are a lot of machines are doing a lot of things and i don't want it to be
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:31.200]   like i'm just like i guess i what i would say is if that is what you're viewing your libraries as
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.880]   is moving your libraries around and all that this is probably not the feature for you it's
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:43.600]   probably not at that level i i would say i'm not sure i cloud photo library in general is for you
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:48.800]   if that's the way you're thinking of it right because you're already cheering everywhere i am
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.360]   putting the cloud and i haven't shared everywhere it's just i think mentally i just have a hard time
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.840]   getting over the fact that i'm going to put it in something else like i really like because it is
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.280]   everything like my i i mean after aperture closed you know my i yeah photo of library it's my
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.000]   library it's my day my digital uh yeah and so yeah and i have copies of it and i have you know i make
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.520]   copies periodically to make sure that if something happened they're not corrupted but i just the i
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   think that for me and i might get over it but but for me especially new you know like i have one
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.440]   sacrificial lamb that has venture on it after the last year's fiasco and so um you know so i'm just
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.440]   my computer's gonna stick just stay back for a little while um the uh you know i wouldn't get into
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:39.600]   anything new and again i just and i've had some issues copying i had i had a lot of issues pulling
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.280]   i photo libraries into aperture where it grabbed just the thumbnails no then i didn't you know i did
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.120]   that's really bad yeah didn't pull all of them in and so i have a lot of thumbnails with things
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:55.840]   that i don't have anymore and and so i have you know so my kind of like andi my my experience with
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:02.240]   with the how apple manages libraries has not been 100 and so i think that i think that kind of
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:10.400]   colors my view of of that feature you know so i'm like i'm like oftentimes i'm doing it as my
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:16.880]   digital asset management i mean i'm uh i put in ros in there when i take pictures i decided maybe
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.720]   wrongly instead of using adobe's paid library or lightroom i'm gonna use it as my dam because
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.320]   it's easy for me then to edit it in lightroom or some other well and i also like the fact that i
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.440]   because 99% of the photos i take are on my on my phone you know and so i do have yeah and so what
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.840]   happens is i take it and a couple minutes later it's gonna be sitting on my it's sitting everywhere
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.480]   you know and i have apps for the likea and for the sony on my iphone that will take what i've
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:50.560]   just taken and do that and and it'll do it in raw so yeah so i'm i think i think in the end it comes
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.120]   down to do you want to use photos as your photo management tool do you want to use iCloud photos
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.000]   as as a as a cloud sync and then and then the third step is and do you want to have uh because
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.080]   in the end it's all a cloud data store with a slightly different id but your mark is the owner
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:12.480]   of it like it is not as scary as i think it sounds moving those pictures around of course not not
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.640]   really right and you and it knows that you're the contributor and you have privileges that other
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.720]   people don't have to that photo they do have the ability to edit it but you've got the original and
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.680]   you can pull it back and take it off the shared and all that stuff but i think it is true like step
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.120]   one is do i want to use photos as as the repository for my stuff step two is do i want to use iCloud
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.160]   and step three is do i want to share part of my iCloud library uh in a common space with someone
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.120]   else who's also sharing that library and at any point i think you can say no but i personally i feel
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.240]   like going to iCloud is the leap you're making not adding the shared library myself going to like
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:52.640]   iCloud now and i guess the thing is is that if if i could if it like literally if it
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.120]   uh let me just say i'm going to copy it over into that file i would ask how many shared folders can
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.440]   i have i would do this all the time like like like as someone who's you know like i would be like i
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.200]   want ten shared folders i want twenty shared folders i don't want one i want them all because i'm
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:11.280]   gonna have this group that that i'm sharing with and this group that i'm sharing with and and i
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.920]   that's not this feature for sure that's that's not a feature i would google does that beautifully
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.760]   though yeah yeah well on but it's you know i anyways so it's an apple has a feature it's just not this
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:32.240]   feature yeah yeah so so i i i do think that the the central focus of a feature like this has to be
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:37.120]   just like the the camera but the camera app on every phone is based on here is a big round button
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:42.160]   that's unmistakable push this button and you will get a at minimum a good picture because that's what
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:48.480]   most people run out of camera and i think that the central truth of this kind of feature has to be
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:54.160]   whatever picture you take will be backed up to the to a place where it's safe if your phone gets
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.040]   stolen or if you're just stupid and you delete things off of your computer or whatever and i think
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.160]   that people are also in the space where i want to be able to share this and not necessarily always
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:10.000]   through high messages so it's it's all the things that we're talking about today are very very real
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.360]   and very very good points but they're also people who understand backups and servers and the idea of
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.760]   the one two three rule and all that sort of stuff whereas people just want to say well don't want
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.680]   to be surprised that wait a minute but my but what how come how come my sister was able to delete
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.960]   a delete a picture out of my library because she was running out of space on her phone or how come
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.920]   but this was a beautiful such a beautiful picture that was able to make a send away for an 8x10 print
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.880]   why a year later does this suddenly look so crummy that's it's barely good enough for instagram
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.640]   so that's all the stuff that needs to be addressed it has to be as simple as i took a picture now
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.880]   it's going to be there forever as long as i keep paying somebody 10 bucks a month and i can very
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.520]   very easily share it with friends relatives and the world if i want to embarrass myself that way
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.600]   all right i do want to get to the ipad reviews so let's take one more break uh before we do that
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:11.120]   Snell is back bearing goodies yay and a naco also here goody good goodly bearing and no and uh no
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:18.320]   and uh mr uh Alex Lindsey that's that's that's my renfer name so goodly bearing so goodly batting
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:26.880]   yeah ruffle our show today brought to you brought to you by eight sleep i love my eight sleep i had a
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.880]   99 percent sleep score last night not this night that was the night the cats woke me up the night
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.960]   before the last night sunday night maybe because we just come back from vegas and i was exhausted i
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:46.400]   don't know but it was it was so great after sleeping in a hotel bed which was fine for a couple of
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.240]   nights to get back in my eight sleep bed and man it's like i am home in fact that's the only bad
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.760]   thing about having an eight sleep pod cover is you're not gonna want to go anywhere you're gonna
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.760]   want to stay in your bed because it's so comfortable good sleep is so important we're all looking for
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.040]   a great night's sleep i think and i think it's it's well known that consistently good sleep can
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.640]   reduce the likelihood of serious health issues can reduce the risk of heart disease lower your
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:21.200]   blood pressure there's even studies to say it reduces the risk of Alzheimer's because you know
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.000]   good good sleep deep sleep is about collecting the pryons floating around in your brain the
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.520]   garbage collection in your brain it's pretty important yet more than 30 percent of americans
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.640]   struggle with sleep you know what the number one problem people complain about feeling hot at night
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.000]   isn't that the worst you wake up sweaty or maybe even worse you wake up freezing cold
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.720]   and as we were heading into winter here in the northern hemisphere maybe it's more likely the
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.240]   latter although you know you turn on the heat at night sometimes you go to bed and you want to
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:56.400]   it's freezing out so you turn on the heat and you're still waking up sweaty let me tell you this is
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.800]   a better way it's also more efficient than turning on the heat in the house heat your bed
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:08.880]   or cool it with your eight sleep pod eight sleep offers the only sleep technology that dynamically
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.920]   cools and heats each side of the bed to maintain optimal sleeping temperature for what your body
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:21.200]   needs it pairs dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking you can add the
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.680]   pod cover to any mattress they also sell a mattress we have the pod cover because we have a mattress
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.880]   we love but you'll start sleeping as cool as get this it goes down all the way to 55 degrees
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:36.960]   Fahrenheit which is like air conditioning i mean it's so nice or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:43.600]   in fact it even can change based on the temperature of the room and how you're sleeping so for
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.640]   instance and and Lisa has different settings than i do sure her side is different than mine but my
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:55.600]   side i always turn it up three or four it goes from off to ten okay so i always turn up to three or
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.800]   four so when i get in it's cozy and then i fall asleep because i'm cozy so cuddly cozy in there
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.440]   but then in order to facilitate deep sleep it drops the temperature a little bit and it turns
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.600]   out that really puts you in a deep sleep so i'm sleeping deeply and then it wakes me up in the
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:16.320]   morning by going up again and i have it set that way so it can't i wake up awake and it's cozy
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.400]   isn't the worst thing winners here now or fall anyway when you wake up in the house is freezing
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.760]   and you don't want to get out of your bed i thought that's how i felt this morning i want to stay here

[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:12.800]   night's sleep and for supporting our podcast so the biggest complaint and you were here for this
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:19.120]   uh last week jason that most people seem to have about apples slipstream announcement last week of
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:26.480]   the new ipads is is the line is very confusing now what's the error for anyway like uh
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.720]   um yeah i have a theory which is the ears for uh replacing the 11 inch ipad pro at some point
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:39.280]   it's going oh interesting so they'll do a 12.9 ipad pro and there's a rumor there's a 14 ipad
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:45.840]   right a large a large ipad so you have two large ipad pros and then uh because right now there are
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.080]   three 11 inch ipads i don't know what they're going to do i have theories but it's all just made up
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.920]   i'm just trying to guess but there are there are three or four depending on you know you count
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.160]   basically the same size ipad you got the the old ninth gen which is a little smaller but
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.080]   basically the same and then you've got the new tenth gen the air and the 11 inch pro it's with
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.400]   different accessories and different compatibility and i think they're headed somewhere and i think
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   we got signs last week that where they're heading is maybe good but it's real confusing right now
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:22.560]   because their highest end model is still stuck in 2018 and you you can't use the apple two pencil
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:29.520]   on the new ipad tenth generation so you have to get your dongle out if you've got the apple two pencil
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.960]   and i hope you saved your dongle and you got the apple two pencil came out in 1981 but
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:43.360]   yes here here it is and there was tethered there's your dongle time dongle time so you have an adapter
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   that takes the lightning connector because your new ipad doesn't have lightning it's got type c
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.600]   yeah which is great except what do you do about that apple pencil one that it's compatible with
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:01.280]   and the answer is that's what i meant one not the two you get a big plastic dongle that attaches to
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.520]   the nubbin on the inside of the cap of the pencils of the technical term a nubbin
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.120]   nubbin it is now it's a nubbin and then did your pencil one come with didn't it come inside didn't
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.200]   your pencil one come with that little thing that adapted an extremely
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.440]   loseable pass through adapter that would let you plug it into a lightning they knew ahead of time
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.920]   that this would happen right right so if you're very low i don't actually don't know if that would
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.160]   work if you could use that adapter and then do a lightning to usbc cable if that would work or not
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.440]   but anyway it is it is it is one of the most awkward yeah products apple has ever made
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.400]   it's nine bucks i mean it's not expensive and future sales of apple pencil one will come with
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.880]   it in the box because no one else is buying this thing except people who are using this ipad
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.360]   but it shows you that apple really ended up uh between a rock and a hard place because they
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.240]   designed the apple pencil two with the inductive charging and the magnetic attachment which i love
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.240]   for whatever reason it's great and for whatever reason they couldn't or wouldn't put it in this
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.840]   model right and so they had to go back to the old one which is lightning but they are going to usbc
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.200]   so what do you do and the answer is plastic thing just seems so backwards for apple like i will say
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.040]   that the it was the everything out there the two things that really stood out for me i mean other
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:18.080]   than the air missing was number one is they move the camera for one ipad but not the pro one i
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:24.480]   understand you know you're like it makes a huge difference having that having that camera in the
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:31.360]   center why is enormous enormous difference and and i think that um i think the the practical answer
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.600]   the pragmatic answer is oh i know i know what the apple right apple didn't want to rebuild the ipad
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.880]   pro body probably because they've got another one coming maybe again just wild speculation here
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.760]   maybe that was originally what was supposed to be out now but at some point during pandemic and
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.240]   supply chain issues maybe they said no we can't do it now let's push it off a little bit and so they
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:57.920]   did no exterior or like uh structural work on that ipad pro they just kind of just did a chip revision
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:04.640]   and so i know why but it is still so frustrating to have to have that change and the and the and the
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.720]   i using the stuff the original pencil is weird like i'm just saying like on a new ipad it's weird
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.960]   like you know and and it's don't forget the function row on the uh keyboard too which is
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.880]   something that people have wanted on that magic keyboard for years and it's on the new one but
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:24.080]   only on the new one yeah and so there's just like there's some new stuff and then there's really old
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.960]   stuff that is like from you know like six years ago twenty-fifths team and it's two and it and
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.680]   when they you know when the new laptops come out and they're obviously just using the old you know
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.360]   like oh we couldn't come up with something new and you're just like really i mean you're apple
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.120]   it's it's like that shot and i'm forgetting we're like you're nasa man you got people thinking about
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.200]   stuff people backing them up it's like you're apple like there's some new products there's
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.760]   some fiction here right apple does not do a brand new hardware revision of every product it releases
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.640]   right like the macbook air looks like it does for a few years and then like that new m to wear
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.920]   the macbook here for the next few years is going to look like that they they don't have a design
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.360]   structure and i think a cost structure that allows them to rethink all of their models every year
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.360]   however this has been four iterations of the ipad row since 2018 and that's why i say it feels to
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.680]   me like they maybe miss their mark with whatever they've got coming next and so they shoved this
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:24.320]   out there as a as a replacement because that's a long time to leave that product that is supposedly
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.920]   your hero product at the top of the ipad product line uh sitting that's the problem having having
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:35.600]   the the lower end one update to something that the higher end one doesn't is the part that i know
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.640]   well they did that before but they did that with a center stage on the ipad air that that
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.120]   that didn't go on the ipad pro until the next ipad pro came out but to have right have the
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.720]   indignity of a new ipad pro that doesn't have the feature exactly exactly so you think next year
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:57.760]   an ipad pro revision that will have the camera on the long side rumors are that it's because this
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:04.400]   is an 18 month cycle right ipad protons to get revived every 18 months okay and so the rumors are
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:15.600]   that there is a new OLED ipad pro design coming in early sigh 2024 okay so yeah okay and who knows
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:20.880]   what that who knows what that's going to look like it's fascinating to see just little things like
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:26.320]   moving the moving the the front facing camera from the shortage to the long edge is apple's
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:32.320]   concession that yeah you know remember those commercials we did where it's not a computer uh it is a
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.680]   computer please please budget this as a computer please at one of its nath please think of it as
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:44.240]   one of one of its many natural uh inclinations is to be attached to a keyboard and a trackpad and do
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.440]   laptopy things actually when you go to the apple store and ask it uh it actually has a response
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:56.080]   you can show this something went wrong i that's all i can think of i wanted to show the yellow ipad
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.360]   you have a yellow old yellow you're gonna call old yellow let me see old yellow because i can't
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.240]   show it something goes right there it is it's yellow any gold and the blue and pink are really
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.440]   nice too i mean it's any metallic yellow is gonna look goldy but it is very yellow and i love the
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.560]   colors like apple has this problem getting colors to pop on their pro models they're like no no no
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.360]   pros are boring and want boring colors right and like the option is fine but give us some fun options
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:28.160]   too and these are much more it's almost like as the price gets lower the fun uh gets poured into
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.000]   them because ipad air has kind of colors but they're kind of muted and these are not muted at all
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.400]   they are they are big and loud and then there's a silver one if you want to be boring that's fine
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.920]   speaking of muted the really muted colors are on the mini which they also did not update yeah
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:49.440]   also not updated yeah to any point i mean we we can talk about the weirdness of it and i think
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.080]   it's not just an academic exercise bot where tech pundits are like what is the meaning of the ipad
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.360]   line now i think it's also a problem for people buying ipads for people in apple stores employees
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.000]   at apple stores explaining to with you know a customer which ipad they should buy and the
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.520]   difference between the ipad air and the 10th generation and the 9th generation that's still on sale and
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   that that is that part of it is frustrating and confusing but i will say i like and that adapter
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:25.440]   is dumb but i like where i see them going in as Andy said the horizontal orientation like
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   actually that's the orientation all they need to do is take that apple logo on the back and go
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.400]   and turn it to and then we're then we're good and the and the trackpad is bigger and they're
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:40.240]   them saying even on the lowest end ipad that's new uh we're going to make a keyboard case and we're
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.040]   going to put a keyboard and a trackpad on it even though that ipad previously only had the ability
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.200]   to do a keyboard but the trackpad is important we think that's important and we're going to put a
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.000]   function row on there which i asked them so many times when the magic keyboard came out why no
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.840]   function row and they gave me kind of a mealy mouth dancer right because they're pr people
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.800]   it's the greatest thing ever why would you need something that's not on it um and so when i see
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:10.000]   the function row i think yes apple has now admitted that ipad users might want a function row on their
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.280]   keyboard to change their brightness or volume without having to reach up and go to control center
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:22.080]   and and that's a good that's good news so that's all good stuff it's just frustrating as an ipad
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.600]   pro user knowing that they're not going to bring it to the rest of the platform probably for a year
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:36.720]   and a half uh and then there's the apple tv which comes a week from pride so you didn't get one of
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.440]   those did you i i didn't get one i bought one because i actually need another apple tv in my house
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.760]   and so i thought i would give it a try so many um there's so many apple tv's like i keep on finding
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.760]   them in drawers i'm like oh yeah no that's better than that got too well the problem is i did that
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:55.120]   too and then i found out it was the original black apple tv little puck that doesn't have the tvOS
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.840]   on has a weird interface i'm like no no i don't want that i don't i don't want that to be like i can't
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.040]   give this to her magnet it doesn't have any apps yeah exactly right i mean i think the big story with
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:13.440]   apple tv is that it's it's while it's not affordable like a roku box or an amazon firebox it is cheaper
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.880]   than it used to be and and now you can see sort of it feels like an apple product where like apple
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.600]   services are available everywhere at this point right you can get those everywhere the only purpose
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:30.720]   of the apple tv is it costs a little bit more and i think it is it is nicer um and i wish it was 99
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.960]   bucks but they have they've made an effort they pulled the ethernet port out they pulled the fan
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:42.800]   out they they pulled the thread radio out and i got one down there uh at a better price for a kind of
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.960]   a splurge upgrade if you want something that's nicer than a roku there's a game though there's a
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:52.240]   psychology game here because it's only 20 bucks more to double the memory to get the ethernet
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.920]   to get the fan to get the thread is not a 20-minute thing so i have a feeling they don't expect to
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.400]   sell many of those on the 29 dollar marketing and i think i think the apple tv is the number one
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:08.960]   argument against an open uh an open app store because they capitulated to a lot of folks and said oh
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.320]   you can just let make people sign in in a weird way into hulu or whatever and in netflix and
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.640]   so now we have all these like the reason i have an i have a new one not the newest one but the last
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.160]   one it's still sitting in a box going like oh my gosh i'm gonna have to go through and figure out
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.720]   what all those registrations are you know and so i just it's there literally i bought it and i put
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:31.920]   it in and then as i started installing the apps i couldn't just say restore restore purchased you
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.920]   know like and it's actually it's that experience that had me become so hardened to i don't want
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:44.240]   any ordering options outside of the app store because as a user i want to be able to open it
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:49.200]   and hit restore to every app that i have on that on that apple tv and it's not that way it's like
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.720]   i got a goofy code and i got out that's because you can blame the evil paranoid tv content
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:59.760]   yeah industry i mean they just really awful i have to log in to showtime every few weeks
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:06.400]   i got rid of it i had to log in i was like every few weeks like i logged in a few weeks ago you
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:12.000]   don't remember me at least apple lets you now remembers your cable company right so there is some
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.320]   but i haven't had cable i haven't had cable tv i don't have that oh no not for decades yeah i'm like
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:25.840]   i haven't had i haven't had i've had cable tv for like one year since 1996 it was horrible it was
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.800]   all these ads like it where it all has come from like you know it's like i can't start 10 minutes
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.120]   late and then just well if you had cable tv you could have watched dsp and and watched the formula
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.360]   one race on sunday that weirdly featured not only tim cook with the checkered flag in the most
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:47.280]   somber checkered flag ceremony i've ever seen yes he thought somebody died oh my god that the
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:53.200]   no the noise alerts he must have been getting on his watch all day long they they i bet they burned
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:58.160]   him a special version the o_s that just disables that entire thing let me see if i can find a picture
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:08.320]   of tim cook uh f1 fans blow up over apple ceo for quote lamis checkered flag wave at the austin grand
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   pre he just did not want to like give an inch on this thing and there was much rejoicing yeah yay
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:24.000]   the the funny thing is and and crofti did not know who it was but uh there's a shot briefly of ed
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.840]   sheeran talking to an f1 official and and crofti goes as ed sheeran talking to any new the name of the
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.520]   f1 official but i didn't notice that the guy in between was eddy q stand i'm i'm positive wait a
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.440]   minute that's eddy q he they had no idea it was another apple exec so i had some like i'm going i'm
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:50.400]   conspiracy theory like apples trying to get f1 uh signed up so when did i find out that same day
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:58.480]   esb and signed a deal for formula one for another three years so i do think it was up for sale and i
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.680]   think eddy and tim were there now that i mean that that esb and purchase was reported a couple
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.960]   months ago is going to happen yeah so it no it's there there's a movie that brad pit is making about
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:14.000]   f1 and it's an apple tv movie oh so they're there for brad because brad did they're shooting they're
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.120]   gonna shoot scenes during on the tracks during events or like you're in the run up to events
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.760]   for that movie so it's definitely a big partnership they're making with with f1 that's why they were
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:33.200]   here's another happy uh tim cook picture he's he reminded me of my kids when we would try to get
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:38.080]   them to do something that they've never done before and he's like very serious of like i'm gonna do it
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.200]   i'm gonna do it it's like it's supposed to have fun man have fun i i will say i was we we did it we
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.120]   did a live shoot from an indie you know where we're putting people on the track you know with the
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:53.520]   other dual cedar i was mario and dreddy and it is overwhelming like to be on the track i just will
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:59.120]   say that that it is to fence it's really there's a lot of noise there's a lot of things out there
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.280]   that can hurt you and there's a lot of things just happening and people everyone's yelling at you
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.640]   if you're in the wrong place you know and so uh it it i can see how he could get just overwhelmed with
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:14.320]   it um here's the here's the video i hope i don't get in trouble with espn for showing this but
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.320]   he's not even waving it he's not even waving it fast i think he was just trying to do i think he was
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.880]   just trying to do it really well trying to do it really well like yeah just like i just like
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:28.560]   i just want to do this right sorry tiff someone didn't someone didn't even
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:36.560]   laughing around i did know that the espn deal it's interesting espn said that they're working on
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:42.720]   streaming like they want to make they want so if you go to the variety article about the espn
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:50.000]   formula one extend track with new rights deal and there's eddy q uh kissing i think that's dannika
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.800]   i know i'm just kidding uh that one of the things they haven't worked out
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:00.480]   what's more the new deal expands espn's direct to consumer rights giving flexibility how it
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.120]   distributes telecasts over the next three years including on the streaming outlet the espn
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.400]   but i wonder if apple might be kind of getting a little bit involved in that as well you know
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.040]   they really want to do sports they could do something really interesting i thought well an
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:21.760]   f1 i mean their their coverage um is incredible like the the you know how they it's very highly
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.720]   covered that sport yeah it's very very hard and their own helicopters and they're passing that
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.440]   all back to the uk and it's they've got this this team that goes out for each weekend and
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.080]   and it's and it goes out in these these containers you know it's just it's incredible if you ever
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.120]   get an invite i'd like to go Alex yeah i don't care anywhere in the world i'll go to Abu Dhabi
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:48.640]   i'll go anyway bakud yeah i don't care uh yeah so it's interesting because i think it's becoming
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.560]   big in the u.s and so now's a good time but of course it's hard you know disney is the one of
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:57.680]   the few companies that can outfit apple i would guess espn very much did not want to let that one
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.480]   go because they they know how how that is a rising sport so they they paid a lot of money for that
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:08.240]   one yeah also the people who follow it are tend tend to buy luxury items that's a good
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:14.080]   that's a good business to be in yes i think it is it is enticing to think about what apple could do
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.000]   with crafting a presentation that links up with apple tv and uses all the digital uh
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.600]   the the telemetry that gets transmitted all across the track between the cars the the pits the
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:33.440]   the the the vans the controllers when i've seen what got me into f1 was not necessarily like the
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.400]   you know nyjal mantle you know totally tolling around an open open cockpit it's like oh my god
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.320]   look at all those numbers and bits it's really amazing they're all the laptops they're they're
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:48.640]   they're plugging into things so super interesting thing yeah yeah uh a couple of other quick stories
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:56.080]   evans hankies leaving so johnny i've left uh you know three years ago and then only recently
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.400]   gave up his independent contract with apple evans hankie was his replacement uh she was in charge
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:08.800]   of apple design now she's leaving in six months um i wonder you know is that i mean apple's known
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:17.520]   for design um she's been there running product design since 2019 there i'm sure other people in
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:25.440]   the in the team that they could bring up but uh to to lose evans right after losing johnny's
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.440]   can't be good well i don't i don't think it's right after losing johnny i think johnny just
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.000]   stopped taking the checks at some point but i yeah i think he's been out of there for quite
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.280]   some time yeah like i don't i think that johnny i've has not been really applied for three
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.920]   four maybe five years yeah it's not yeah he got it was a kind of a nice soft like let's not
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:50.320]   spook anybody but but he was he was done a while ago allen die is still there long time
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.840]   ahead of design you might blame him actually for the system preferences he's had a design for
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:01.680]   software and user interfaces he's still there um remember johnny was in charge of user interfaces
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.280]   towards the end they gave him everything oh oh oh oh i remember
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.520]   my my therapist no longer has me bring in that the punching doll anymore i can just
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.240]   look my eyes aren't twitching anymore it's therapy works folks tell me on this
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:25.680]   skill morphic doll where the ipad update actually actually you might have a problem
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.240]   uh finding where you need to touch because he decided to remove more buttons and indicators
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.080]   because they they offended his eye so he plucked them out yes bono is writing a memoir
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:45.440]   in which he explains how it came to be that there was a black and red u2 ipod
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:53.520]   and how you got a u2 album you didn't want on your on your ipod and i have to give him credit
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:30:01.200]   because he really took a full responsibility for that screw up yeah he he really pushed it let me
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:12.400]   see if i can read the the quote is hysterical um he said uh okay so free music as tim cook the
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:17.760]   ceo of apple with look of mild incredulity are you talking about free music you want to give
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.200]   this music away free with the whole point of what we're trying to do at apple is to not give away
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:26.960]   music free the point is to make sure musicians get paid now i said i don't think we give it away
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:34.800]   free i think you pay us for it and then you give it away free as a gift to the people wouldn't that
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.960]   be wonderful tim cook raise and i brought you mean we pay for the album and then just distribute it
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:46.880]   i said yeah like when nyftic buys the movie and gives it away to subscribers tim looked at me as if
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:51.360]   i was explaining the alphabet to an english professor but we're not a subscription organization
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:31:01.120]   not yet i see it not yet let us be the first uh bono says i take full responsibility
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:08.000]   not guy oh not edge not adam not larry not tim cook not eddie q i thought if we could just put
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.600]   our music within the reach of people they might choose to reach out towards it not quite at first
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.320]   i thought this was just an internet squall we were Santa Claus and we'd knocked a few bricks out as
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:23.600]   we went down the chimney with our bag of songs but quite quickly we realized we'd bumped into a
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:31.200]   serious discussion about the access of big tech to our lives he likened it to uh pouring milk on
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:37.920]   people's cereal when they're lactose intolerant he said well we thought free milk was a good thing
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:46.240]   but maybe not i am going to read this because i'm sure it'll be a wonderful uh memoir uh he uh
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:52.560]   that was very very nice moment he did he did the thing is i would not have understood this
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:58.400]   until it actually started happening but like even now like when i go through like my my my
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:05.280]   my on my foul server like my the music that i own it's like what why the hell did i buy that and i
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:11.520]   remember oh no this was pushed into my library as a free promotional trek and it's like but i don't
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.000]   want that i don't want that coming up in shuffle play that's not music that i like and you feel as
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.280]   though you're you didn't give up control you had control taken away from you as that was
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:27.680]   apple had to make a tool yeah exactly there was a there was a tech there was a tech support article
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.640]   somebody had to be paid someone had to use some of his sort of his hourly time to here's how to
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:38.080]   here's how to remove the thing that we thought you'd be delighted to have uh there also is some
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:44.160]   insight into uh the u2 ipod which i bought for my sister came with the u2 songs on it was a beautiful
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.920]   you know all the ipods up to that point had been black and red
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:55.840]   uh so it started because they wanted to be in those iconic ipod ads with the dancing silhouettes they
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:04.400]   said it could be us playing vertigo or you know our new song in the ad and and steve said well you
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.040]   know i i don't think we can we have the kind of budget that you might expect actually steve i said
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:14.080]   we don't want cash we just want to be in the ipod commercial steve was thrown
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:20.160]   entrigge said if that's the deal you don't have to think twice you need to run up by the creative
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:25.280]   team there's one other thing added palm again is although the band are not looking for cash
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:28.640]   some apple stock even a symbolic amount might be a courtesy
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.520]   sorry said steve that's a deal breaker silence
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:41.280]   music people right well i tentatively suggested how about our own ipod a customized u2 ipod in
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.960]   black and red steve looked non plus apple he said is about white hardware you wouldn't want a black
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.440]   one he thought for a moment i could show you what it would look like but you won't like it
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:59.520]   so johnnie made it uh they had a red you know spin dial because that looked like the atomic bomb
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:07.360]   album cover that u2 had released um there you go that's the and it was a beautiful ipod and if
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:15.600]   you still have one uh here it is if you still have one the edges holding it uh you know that was
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:21.200]   lucky that's a special ipod that wasn't that was an interesting time when like the capacity of ipods
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:27.360]   were such that the idea of buying one as a container for all of the music of a band was very very
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.320]   interesting and attractive yeah yeah especially did they did they do am i misremembering there was a
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.360]   yellow beetles one i don't think so but there was no they did but if there was one there
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.840]   but they did do the digital box set with u2 which was another groundbreaking thing right where they
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:46.240]   took their entire output and it was a single purchase and you got all the b sides and everything and
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.360]   i mean digital box that it was literally just uh bundle of all their albums still that was the
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.120]   first time i'd seen anything like that ninety nine bucks i bought all of led zeppelin's uh stuff on
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.480]   i-tune so i mean that was i was thrilled i was really thrilled
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:03.360]   jason you were you were at the youtube uh you you were at the launch event weren't you with the
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.400]   jobs in the yep i was too i just post i just put a link in the show notes for my my thick
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.280]   photos from uh from flicker uh that i posted from that thing the ability the ability to see like
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:18.480]   youtube for for former acoustic set from like twenty five away i know right that that was that
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.760]   was that that might be my favorite favorite music i i couldn't believe it right because it was just
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:31.920]   i mean it was bono and the edge right this is a tiny uh theater year wow yeah that was the california
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.960]   theater in san hosei i want to say is where that event was so you were out close and personal was
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.720]   i mean one of my favorite bands of all time and then they're right in front of me doing that it was
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:49.280]   amazing it was that star power that like like like and he said the ipod made this weird fusion
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.840]   suddenly happened between apple and the music industry and that's when we started getting the
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.040]   huge stars showing up at these apple events to perform live which was just amazing yeah
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:05.200]   yeah seeing fufa seeing uh seeing a van like the fuf fighters and like nobody nobody is like
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.480]   yelling woo during the during the quiet parts no one is it's like how can you how can you beat that
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.920]   it's like yeah it's pretty interesting yeah that that was uh i remember how excited you were about
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:21.680]   seeing dave girl up close personal i yep exactly i did i did not have the presence of my
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:29.680]   request of selfie i was in journalism most requested photo damn it and when when chris martin from
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.160]   cole play performed at nappell event i was sitting next to chris breen who is it an accomplished pianist
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.960]   who turned to me and said well for a piano player he's a pretty good rock star
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:46.800]   really did really expect shade to be thrown at chris bro but he's not wrong i mean like chris martin's
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:52.400]   forte is not picking at the piano like you know but anyway that was some great musical artists but
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.480]   you they played that was a big moment was that this steve jobs memorial you weren't there that's
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:01.600]   when they know but they've been played a uh your aboyna event along with like and kind of you know

[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:13.520]   the musical artists uh drake didn't perform though drake just showed up in a jacket but uh the
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.320]   musical artists on stage at apple events is a it's a quite a list it's amazing well it's a testament
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:25.440]   to the power apple wields in the music industry and i think still does although i imagine less so now
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.440]   that spotify is here but but they're the two big services yeah right and isn't it telling the bono
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.720]   and that was a savvy comment right which is you don't have to pay us we'll just be in an ipad
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.600]   your ipod commercial for free it's like yeah with our new single yeah they knew how many
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:47.200]   singles that would sell good idea million idea of hello hello right that was a vertical wasn't it
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:53.600]   vertical yeah i remember the yep and somebody in the chatroom said uh nice song but they really
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:01.920]   needed some help with the lyrics uno dos thres cut torsy i mean it's a joke it's a joke is intentional
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.240]   okay good yes then that's good i actually saw that tour in that toronto spent a lot of money for
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:14.960]   scalper to see i've only ever seen you two live at apple events exactly up close i see i've seen
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.400]   it in elvis castello i've seen like all if you name like my favorite top band i think i think the only
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.240]   ones i have not seen that i would love to see live but i can't because of ticket master would be
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.800]   palma cartney i think that's of all the bands that i would like to see but we cannot because of ticket
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.040]   master that would be the only one that i haven't seen thank you thanks to being invited apple
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:40.000]   events you were not wrong there was a beetles limited edition box set ipod sold at blooming
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.920]   dales here's a picture of it thank you to user 1123 120 gig ipod with the beetles logo uh on the
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.680]   front and ablory road silhouette on the back and a unique number etched in
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:58.480]   2500 of them they sold at the time for 795 795 dollars i imagine if you had one
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:05.520]   you uh you probably could sell it for a little bit more i'm guessing but it's a little bit yellow
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.640]   um when was that does i hate when they don't have a a date on their uh on their posts and they don't
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:19.040]   ebay has a list listed about 1500 dollars so not bad so only twice the price mint condition i bought
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:27.920]   on ebay there was a beetles release that had a metal green apple that had a USB key for the stem
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.120]   i did buy that i thought that was pretty cool yeah there's one of my favorite youtubers tech
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.720]   moan who does a whole bunch of like uh not not just celebrating vintage tech but telling the
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:45.840]   stories of like old formats and how they came to be uh every it's he will people come up with this
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:52.880]   format that was existed only for like 11 months and yes the the the beetles made this like tiny
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.240]   made a version of the version of the sergeant pepper album for this format you've never heard
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:04.160]   of and because nobody bought it it's like the 30 000 dollar beetles album and it's like you
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:09.120]   you have no idea how many formats there were out there until you see a historian sorry well this one
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:15.760]   was there was a fight between phillips and so phillips and and a german tape company and they
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.920]   decided to both do the same format in different packages and it's it's very very it's like looking
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.560]   at alternative reality uh and it's also looking at collectors mentality because i'm very surprised
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:33.520]   that that 25 only 2500 copies of that beetles album collection uh i would i would have expected
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:40.160]   that to be a little more expensive these uh i bought it because well it was cool because it's an actual
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:46.560]   metal oh yeah but also uh this was a remix it was done in 2009 and it was 24-bit so this was the
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.640]   highest quality uh beetles music they ever released i think and it was on that u.s.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.400]   that i think i think one of the most prophetic things ever said in any movie was in the first
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.560]   minute black movie when when agent case it up look at this alien technology of music product
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.640]   was like i have to buy the i'm gonna have to buy the white album again how many how many times i
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:11.200]   read it by the white album i don't tell you i'm about i'm about to buy revolver for must be like
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.600]   the ninth or tenth time as soon as like the greatest album master edition comes up yeah yeah
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.000]   yeah every time they do the 50th anniversary i i go out and buy it so this must be 60th now
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:30.000]   wow 62 yeah we're in the 60s Sam wow uh i think that's everything i know there's so much more to
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:37.680]   talk about but i think we have done a pretty decent job of getting getting the next week right
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.760]   there's always next week i'm very grateful to you Jason because you have all the devices you
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.280]   give us a great review i appreciate it thank you yeah thank you next week the financial so once again
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.640]   we will that's right we will be here we'll be here we'll be here things over i will i will be with
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.120]   - Don't press, don't press, don't press, don't press.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.160]   - Turn, turn, turn, turn.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.040]   - And I'm gonna say...
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.120]   - That's okay, then, I'll retire.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.780]   I'm just gonna sit here in December and just nod.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:57.600]   (laughs)
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.380]   That'll be it for me.
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:59.220]   - That's right.
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:01.700]   Apple's quarterly results are Thursday.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:06.700]   I did wanna ask, given that I just bought a Mac book,
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.060]   do you think that the new M2 MacBooks are any time-imminent?
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.600]   German saying in the next few months.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.420]   - Yeah, I think German's hesitation there
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.720]   is maybe that he has old information
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.480]   that they were planning it this fall
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:24.000]   and now isn't 100% sure they will roll it out.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.960]   I mean, I think there's a decent chance
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.640]   it's still gonna happen in the next few weeks.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:29.880]   - They've done it in November before.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.720]   - Yeah.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.240]   - Just press release though, just like these.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.680]   - These were already redesigns last year, right?
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.520]   So all they have to do is put an M2 in it.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:41.920]   - Yeah, it'll be new M2 Pro and M2 Macs, yeah.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.640]   - I miss my 14, I have to say.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.280]   I love the light thin MacBook Air, M2 MacBook Air,
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.040]   but I miss those ports and I just like the little.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.800]   - I think the 15th is probably about the outer edge.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.120]   - 'Cause then you miss the holidays.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.280]   - Once you get into, yeah, well once you get into Thanksgiving,
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.640]   I don't think that they wanna do it in a bit.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.560]   Maybe they have done them in December, but it's really rare.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.880]   And the only reason they would do this.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.360]   - And the eighth is election day.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.400]   So it ain't gonna be the election, election day.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.480]   There'll be a lot of news out of that.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.960]   It's not gonna be November 1st, we'd know by now.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.800]   - No, yeah.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.640]   - So I think you're right.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.240]   - I think it has to be the 15th,
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.760]   if they're gonna do it on Tuesday.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.000]   It has to be the 15th.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000]   - And Apple historically, they try to really, really wind down
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.280]   and let people go home like in December.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.360]   I mean, I'm not even joking.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.160]   It's like something really disastrous has to happen.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.760]   A deadline has to slip to most biblical proportions
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.800]   for them to do a big announcement in December,
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   or for anything really big to happen out of Apple in December.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.840]   - Yeah, I think the next time after November
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.160]   would probably be February.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.620]   - Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:47.460]   So,
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:50.360]   - And usually March, or early March.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.960]   - I don't know what I'm rooting for.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.960]   (laughing)
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.280]   - The thing is when you need hardware,
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.960]   you just need hardware.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.480]   - I had to have it.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.160]   - I really had to have it.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.440]   - I used to have to buy more Mac minis
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.280]   and I'm just like,
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.120]   "Oh, I just want to--"
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:04.960]   - Well, that's what we're waiting on.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.960]   We want to do Zoom ISO.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.680]   And it requires an Apple Silicon.
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.020]   And we want to get it,
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:12.840]   you don't want to get it all year old Mac mini.
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.320]   We want to get the new Mac mini, if there is one.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.440]   - I will tell you that I've been doing tons of Zoom ISO
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.340]   tests and you're not going to get any more out of a bigger,
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:23.500]   I have a eight gig Mac mini that's doing eight STI outputs.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500]   - Okay, that was a question.
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.340]   So we don't need more power.
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:30.940]   - It's at eight, with eight outputs, it's like 45%.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.900]   It's barely, it's just coming along and just pushing out.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:37.660]   Well, and it's a mixture of Silicon
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.300]   and the mixture of Zoom playing.
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.580]   You know, they basically just read the Red Apple's guide
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:44.420]   and then just wrote to it.
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:46.520]   Like, they're not making anything up,
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.160]   they're not doing extras, they're not getting fancy,
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.600]   they're just doing exactly what Apple describes to them.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.160]   They're trying to get rid of the frames as they come in
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.400]   as fast as they possibly can and get them just to straight out
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.360]   to the STI, SDI is the best way to go in this case
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.880]   where it's the lowest impact on the CPU.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.800]   - How much RAM do we need?
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.200]   - Eight gigs is fine.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.920]   - Eight gigs is really-- - You can get more, John.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.720]   - You can get the 16s, but it doesn't matter.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:12.480]   Like it doesn't-- - It'll be 24 if it's--
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.080]   - All the tests.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:18.420]   - All the tests that I'm doing are with an eight gig
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:23.420]   and on this Friday I'm doing a test with 16 ounce,
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:24.560]   just to see how it goes.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.400]   - Okay.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.240]   - So we'll take a look.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:29.900]   - So November 15th, keep that date in mind.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.840]   By the way, one of the reasons we wanna move to Zoom ISO
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.800]   is it will really help with latency and overlap, you know,
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.300]   over-talking with our hosts.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.180]   - And it looks nicer, it actually looks better.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:41.580]   - Well, so it's the color and frame rate are better.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.420]   - Oh, good.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.780]   - Yeah, so it's all the good stuff.
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.620]   - We're very excited about it.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:47.240]   We have all the pieces in the puzzle.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.520]   John's been bringing his M1 Mac Mini just to play with it.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.180]   - And you're using the Sonic box with a card or--
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.500]   - What did we--
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.620]   - A dongle arrives tomorrow.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:00.460]   - A dongle arrives tomorrow, not the Sonic box.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.460]   - The Sonic dongle.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:03.860]   - The Sonic dongle, that's for the AES or--
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:07.700]   - It's for a center, it's a good center, it's for a center hit.
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:08.540]   - Oh, okay.
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:11.300]   - Dongle, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:14.900]   - No, because if I ever read a memoir of my time
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:19.100]   like reporting on Apple, it would be called a dongle arrives tomorrow.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:20.500]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:25.140]   - Soon dongle also rises.
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:28.420]   We will take a little break, come back and get your picks of the week, guys.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:34.140]   So get them together, ah, well, I talk about what a surprise, our Tricaster.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:36.220]   We love the Tricaster.
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:42.540]   John, have you now mastered some of the amazing skills required to use some of the features
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.020]   that we never use?
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:52.340]   The Tricaster is so powerful, it's an entire live production system in a box.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:59.940]   The most complete live production system on the planet, Newtex Tricaster 2 Elite.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.700]   Now, Undercheck has a whole line of Tricasters.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:07.380]   In fact, you can go to their site, but this is an incredible tool.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:11.140]   That's what we're using at Twit.
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:14.540]   It does everything you want to create content for the internet, for mobile.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:19.060]   A lot of TV stations and networks use it too, television distribution, a lot of churches,
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.620]   a lot of schools.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:25.180]   Late last year, Newtex unleashed an updated version of the Tricaster 2 Elite, bringing
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:30.940]   in a host of new and much loved features like their Live Call Connect, which supports
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:35.460]   Facebook Messenger WhatsApp FaceTime as inputs to any production.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:40.300]   In addition, selectable audio and video returns, which allows the Tricaster 2 Elite operators
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:42.980]   to view an audio return just like any other output.
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:48.580]   It gives you a whole bunch of more flexibility and kind of a handle on what's going on.
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:53.420]   The all new Neural Voice Isolation tool cleans up your audio using AI.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:57.380]   You can cancel or reduce background noise automatically to detect voices.
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.220]   It really makes a difference.
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:05.180]   We know audio is as important as video and these kinds of productions certainly are.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:09.460]   Increased power, flexibility and simplicity have driven some of the exciting new capabilities.
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:11.420]   They have variable support in macros.
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:12.980]   John's always making me new macros.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.140]   I have now a QR code macro.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.140]   I love that.
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:21.540]   The system offers a dynamic and powerful macro tool that allows operators to nest macros
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:24.100]   so you can get even more complex.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:29.300]   The Tricaster 2 Elite now supports encoding of three channels in anything from HD to UHD
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:34.420]   at the same time, allowing greater power and flexibility to productions.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:38.580]   They've brought the live panel builder into the Tricaster so you can create your own bespoke
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:44.260]   user interfaces, completely customize the presets, quality and creativity are there
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.260]   too.
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:47.500]   You can, John Ashley is doing it right now.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:52.300]   See the resolution and frame rate of every video source coming into the Tricaster.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:57.500]   You've got an NDI Genlock tool so the Tricaster 2 Elite users can match outputs to a common
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:58.620]   sync pulse you know about.
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:00.500]   I don't have to explain why you would want to do that.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.300]   That really makes a big difference.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.740]   Perfect for remote workflows.
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:07.580]   You can send an alpha channel through one of the mix outs, which is really cool.
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:15.100]   You can use keying to feed graphics, real-time 3D creation tools to post in live in effect.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:20.220]   Since its arrival in 2020, the Tricaster 2 Elite has offered an incredibly powerful live
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.380]   production system.
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.060]   We only use on 100 of the capabilities.
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.060]   It's so powerful.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.620]   There's nothing it can't do.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:31.140]   And these new updates, they put even more power in the hands of storytellers everywhere.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:38.740]   Tricaster 2 Elite, totally transformative, setting new standards better than broadcast.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:44.460]   I think back to tech TV and the crappy stuff we had compared to this that cost millions
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.060]   of dollars, millions of dollars.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:49.260]   The Tricaster 1 Pro, take a look at that.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.180]   You may not need the two Elite.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:55.860]   The Tricaster 1 Pro is fantastic for producers, content creators and publishers.
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:58.100]   It's got future ready capabilities.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:02.860]   Live Call connects in their 4K UHD switching, live streaming recording.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:04.340]   It's data driven.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:07.940]   Explore the latest in the Tricaster family.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:14.380]   Visit go.newtech.com/twit-tv.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:17.620]   There's an easy to use interactive guide there that'll let you go through it and figure
[01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:19.700]   out which Tricaster is right for you.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.700]   You just press that big start button.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:27.220]   Go.newtech.com/twit-tv.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.580]   We could not do what we do without Tricaster.
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:33.220]   And we've been using Tricaster since 2008.
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.700]   It made Twit happen.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:36.780]   It's the best choice ever make.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:40.620]   Go.newtech.com/twit-tv.
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.300]   Thank you, Tricaster.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:47.260]   Now we go on with the shows with the picks of the week.
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:50.500]   Let's go from left to right, Jason.
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:53.060]   You can start with your pick of the week this week.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:59.660]   All right, I decided to get extra super nerdy here and recommend a thing called the Ink
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:02.260]   Plate 6 Color.
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:06.420]   And also beyond this product, I want to say I like the idea of products like this.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:12.180]   This is a color E Ink display in a 3D printed case.
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:13.380]   You get it all together.
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:18.420]   I did a project where I took an Ink display and I put a 3D print in my own case and I
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:21.420]   had to figure out how to heat set screws and all these things.
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:24.660]   You know what's better is if I could just buy it with a case.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:27.180]   So this is what Crowd Supply has done.
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.580]   It's all put together.
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:33.380]   You can take off the screws and put an 8 of fruit battery in it for like 20 bucks and
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:36.940]   it lasts for weeks months.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:37.940]   And it's Arduino.
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.780]   So basically you plug into it.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:40.860]   I do this on my Mac.
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:45.580]   You get the Arduino IDE and you can the simplest one and the one.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.020]   This is a weather one.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.780]   I'm going to just do it where it loads an image off my server.
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:52.420]   It wakes up every hour or 15 minutes or whatever.
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:54.500]   You're going to have a kitty cat in every 15 minutes.
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:55.500]   Well, you could.
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:56.780]   You get full color.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:52:00.140]   It takes a long time to draw that on the screen.
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.140]   But it will draw it.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.140]   So you can put it.
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:03.140]   It's got an SD card slot.
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:06.340]   You can actually just put an SD card full of photos and set it to cycle through those
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:10.700]   photos and you can hang it on a wall because it's going to last for months probably with
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:11.700]   the with the battery.
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:14.300]   It doesn't use any power to read.
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:20.780]   And when it's a sleep, it's really a sleep and it's not drawing any power.
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:24.580]   And yeah, so I'm going to load something off of a server in my house.
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.660]   I actually don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:30.700]   And and you know the development environment is is a little bit to learn.
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:35.620]   But with help and googling and looking at their forums, you can get it to do some remarkable
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:39.020]   things and and on super low power.
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:40.540]   And I just love the idea of this.
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:43.940]   In fact, this is what now that we're coming out of that shortage, right?
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:47.500]   The chip shortage and the legacy nodes and all that sort of thing.
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:53.300]   This is the kind of stuff I want to see, which is people taking a Arduino controller or a
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:59.380]   Raspberry Pi and a display and a 3D printed case and put it together and sell it as a
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:00.380]   product.
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:03.620]   I will pay you more if I don't have to 3D print it myself.
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.060]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:06.540]   And so this is the start.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.260]   This is one 29 with the case.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.260]   And it's fun.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:15.460]   I love these low power, even displays, let you do digital stuff, even on battery with
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:17.380]   long battery life.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:20.380]   And so you can actually hang it on the wall.
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:26.060]   My pal Dan Morin is using one to do a I'm on the air sign for his office door.
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.060]   And you just hang it there, right?
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.260]   You don't need any cables or anything.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:32.300]   And it every five minutes, I think it wakes up and pinks the network and basically says,
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:33.500]   is Dan recording?
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:37.380]   And if it is, it puts up a signed and if he isn't, it takes that sign down and puts something
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:38.380]   else up there.
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:39.380]   Super clever.
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:44.940]   I love Eink displays and I just love the idea that this company actually packaged the whole
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:48.300]   thing together like a product because I don't need to 3D print it myself.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.300]   And that color is pretty good.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.300]   I'm kind of surprised.
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.300]   It's really good.
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:53.940]   It takes like 30 seconds to draw it.
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:56.140]   But once it's done drawing, it looks great.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:58.940]   Yeah, and it's very solid because it's not refreshing.
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:08.060]   Ink plate six color with 3D printed enclosure, crowdsupply.com/soddard or soldered for those
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:09.060]   of you in the UK.
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:10.060]   They have other ones.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.940]   Ink plate dash six color.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.580]   But this one's six color is beautiful.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:14.580]   It's beautiful.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:16.620]   It's full full color.
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.620]   Looks really good.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:19.620]   I mean, even for photos, looks really good.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:20.620]   Nice.
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.860]   Very nice.
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:23.860]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:24.860]   Oh, man.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:26.580]   You just I can't buy everything.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:27.580]   I want to.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:28.580]   I know.
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:29.580]   I know.
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:30.580]   I really want to.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.580]   I need it on air sign.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.860]   All right.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:34.500]   Your turn Andy and not co.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.500]   What do you want to sell me?
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:37.500]   No, it's free.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.500]   Oh, good.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.500]   I like it.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:40.500]   I like it.
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:41.500]   Again, man of the people.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:44.140]   I hope I can count on your support.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.140]   Come November.
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:52.020]   So DuckDuckGo everybody knows about the browser extensions that gives you for privacy about
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:55.700]   the search engine that is very, very privacy oriented and all the other work they do.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:00.180]   They have been working on their own web browser for about a year now.
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:03.700]   It's been in private beta and now it is in public beta for Macs.
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:07.340]   If you go to DuckDuckGo.com/Mac, you will see it.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:12.820]   And a browser that's not as quite as full featured as Safari is or Chrome is or even
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:19.700]   Firefox is, but man, does it do a great job of being a browser which has privacy absolutely
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:25.260]   baked in not as a collection of the browser extensions that might fire off and not fire
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:26.260]   off.
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.860]   This is one that really guides you through the process of being aware of every single
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:34.460]   thing that websites do to identify you and to track you and basically explaining what's
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:39.100]   going on as it's happening and asking, hey, do you want this to happen or not?
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:43.420]   It's based on and so as part of privacy security, it's not based on Chromium.
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:50.340]   It's not based even on it's actually based on WebKit because they said they chose WebKit
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.940]   because it gives them the greatest amount of control over what goes on in the browser
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:57.380]   with the least amount of cruft from from from Google.
[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:59.540]   So that's that's definitely really good thing.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:04.140]   It has so will automatically do things like again, block tracking block cookies if you
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:10.820]   want or let you stay logged in without having to necessarily erase cookies that don't necessarily
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:14.860]   compromise your security but is our pain in the butt if they are if they don't remain
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:15.860]   present.
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:19.740]   It even has a built in like alternative YouTube video player.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:24.540]   So if you click a link on a YouTube video, you can actually have it play using DuckDuckGo's
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:29.620]   browser's own internal video player so that even the YouTube site is not necessarily
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.500]   seeing you or tracking you.
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:32.660]   I've been using it for about a week.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:37.700]   I think the went into public beta a little over a week ago.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:43.060]   I find I can't rely on it as my main browser, although it does do a really good job of importing
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:46.700]   all your bookmarks and save passwords from whatever browser you've been working on.
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:52.260]   However, it has earned a place as one of the browsers that I keep on my desktop that's
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:58.060]   if I'm just doing sort of random random work on the web or if there is if I'm doing something
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:02.020]   where I really want extra privacy but it doesn't necessarily it doesn't necessitate something
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.420]   as drastic as going through a tour browser.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:09.860]   I've just I've read about a mention of a certain car and when I see I wonder if that was
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:13.100]   if I can't believe that that person has a super car like that.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:14.620]   I want how much that car costs.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:18.700]   If I want to find out how much that car costs without being put on a list of people who are
[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:23.700]   looking at $120,000 cars, I will fire up a duck duck go for that.
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.900]   So it's it's pretty stable.
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:32.620]   Sometimes I find that it slows down like to crawl not not on a regular basis, but sometimes
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:34.220]   I guess it's just not optimized.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:37.940]   It's possible that this is all happened in the last day because I don't know if it's
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:41.620]   been updated for venture yet, but definitely worth definitely with downloading, definitely
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:46.860]   worth having having on your on your dock bar and definitely worth following as this could
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:53.500]   be like a good primary browser and maybe six or six months time or a year.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:01.260]   I've just learned there are 12 miniature pumpkins hidden throughout Twit.
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:03.740]   Please stay out of people's workspace.
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:08.580]   First person to find all 12 gets bragging rights and a $25 Amazon gift card.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.860]   John, get out of here.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:11.860]   Go on.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:13.900]   You don't need to switch this show no more.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.460]   Go look for some pumpkins.
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:25.300]   This is we we've we've taken we've nominated Sebastian to be our party guy and they're
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:28.860]   trying to trick you into engaging in a team building exercise.
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:32.580]   If you want to participate, he says nothing needs to be moved in order to find them.
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:36.460]   So please do not move the pumpkins objects or reveal their location.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:37.660]   So everyone is a chance to look.
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:39.220]   I found one pumpkin.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.220]   You found one immediately.
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:41.220]   Okay.
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:42.540]   I can say where.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:48.140]   Take a photo of each one and once you have a photo of all 12 claim your prize.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:51.300]   It's a virtual scavenger hunt here in the Twit studio.
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:52.300]   I take it.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:53.300]   There are none in here.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:57.060]   I didn't see Sebastian sneaking any miniature pumpkins.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.740]   John, John's just letting us says I've been in here the whole time.
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.420]   What since yesterday?
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:03.420]   Okay.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:07.540]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:12.140]   So I was actually shooting with my brother last week, which I haven't done for a while.
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:17.300]   He's usually busy working on films and we were scouting out where we were going to shoot
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:21.060]   the week before that and it came up and I just hadn't used this app for a while and
[01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.220]   I reopened it because he uses it all the time.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:26.300]   He just opens it up and starts trying to figure out what he's going to use.
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:27.820]   It's called Artemis Pro.
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:32.820]   And Artemis Pro is, it's an iPhone app and what it lets you do, I'll cut to this here.
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:41.340]   You can see through my camera here and what you have is, you know, so you'll notice here
[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:43.620]   that this is the camera that I'm using.
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:46.460]   This is the, what lenses I want to use.
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:50.860]   Oh, I can define my, my, my, so if I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to use.
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:56.140]   So this is like directors that carry around that little lens on a chain around their neck.
[01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.700]   This is like that.
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:01.980]   And the company who makes this actually makes one for the iPad that will, you can put those
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:03.420]   lenses on if you want.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:04.420]   Oh, wow.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:09.060]   But, but this is if you're scouting and when I've, I just hadn't been doing this for a while.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:11.740]   And so this is where I was, I'm kind of scouting through here.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:16.020]   And so I can look through here and I go, Oh, well, I want to go a little closer or if I
[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:18.140]   want to, you know, and these are the actual.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:20.260]   So you can set up the actual focal length.
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:21.260]   So I can decide that.
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:24.940]   And then of course I can take a picture of that and that's going to save that out so
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:27.940]   that I can send it to somebody and go, okay, well, that's what it's going to look like.
[02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:28.940]   Wow.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:30.100]   You know, this is what it's going to look like from here.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:34.020]   And if you want to see like kind of everything, you can go in here and it'll show you this,
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:39.100]   these squares are every, you know, at 135, you know, it's going to be just this little
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:43.300]   bit, this, this little bit down here at 14, it's going to be out here.
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:46.900]   And so you get it kind of a sense of, you know, what all of those, those angles might
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:48.100]   look like you can turn it off.
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.460]   So cool.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:53.500]   And so it's a really cool and it has just, you know, like, like all the lenses.
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:58.340]   So, you know, so not maybe not all the lenses, but, you know, I think a couple thousand lenses
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:01.100]   that are here that you can go in.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:05.860]   So, so it's really important that you're able to get the lens that you're trying to, to
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:06.860]   match.
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:09.100]   It can actually give you the IMAX frame.
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:13.700]   Yeah, I think you'd have to, yes, I think that if we went in here, so you go to the cameras
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:18.180]   and you go to film motion picture and then you go to the 70 millimeter.
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:19.980]   I saw the IMAX, yeah.
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:21.460]   You could say, well, that was the lenses.
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:26.060]   And so now you, you could say is I want the eight perf 65 and we'll grab that and then
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:28.260]   I'll go into the lenses and we'll go to, let's see.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.100]   Oh, I see you have to match the lens.
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:33.940]   And then I'll say I want the prime lenses and I want the, you know, so I'll say done with
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:34.940]   that.
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:36.620]   Now, this is, that's going to be the IMAX shot.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.620]   That's the frame.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:45.460]   That's the IMAX shot of with a 30 millimeter on the IMAX eight perf 65 millimeter.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.060]   That's so beautiful.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:53.220]   Yeah, these are, so it's a, it's a, it's really useful when you're, when you're on set and
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:56.540]   you're, you're like, you're trying to, you're doing a scout and you're saying, well, what
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:02:00.560]   is my frame going to actually look like and what lenses do I actually need and what's
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.940]   going to, you know, fix all of that?
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:04.900]   Because that's the otherwise you're guessing or buying a lot of, or renting a lot of extra
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:06.620]   lenses and, and everything else.
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:10.180]   And so you want to be able to define those things and you can use this for store boards,
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.180]   you know, as well.
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.740]   So you can sit there and it's got some visualization for people in there and stuff like that as
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:15.740]   well.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.540]   So you can, this is going to be a thousand bucks.
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.740]   It's only $30, which makes it affordable for anybody who wants to pick up people in bars.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:23.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.300]   I may, I'm assisted to read.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:26.300]   Exactly.
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:27.300]   You're absolutely scouting it.
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:29.180]   I'm just scouting locations.
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:32.540]   I thought you might be a good person in the background.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:35.700]   So it's, but it really is a pro app.
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:36.700]   You know, it's so, yeah.
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:37.700]   No, I think so.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:38.700]   Command's a pro.
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:39.700]   And it comes on the iPad too.
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:40.700]   Well, 30 is not that bad.
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:41.700]   I thought it would be a lot more.
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:42.700]   That's great.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:43.700]   Yeah.
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:44.700]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:45.700]   It's great.
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:46.700]   Very cool.
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:51.420]   iPad or iPhone works even better with the new iPhone, I think.
[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.420]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.420]   Yeah.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:54.420]   Absolutely.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:55.420]   Yeah.
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:56.980]   It's not global every morning.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:03:01.820]   It's a great place to find out what's going on in the world of video production and more.
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.700]   Today's show, Getting the Most Out of Office Hours is probably the first thing you should
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:06.700]   watch.
[02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:07.700]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.700]   It's kind of an open discussion for bouncing around talking about it.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:12.660]   How do you get the most out of the show?
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:15.380]   But they, well, it's, you know, it's kind of a whole community.
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:18.660]   So it's really like thinking about all the different things you could do inside of the
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:19.660]   community.
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:22.060]   And so it's, it's pretty good.
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:26.380]   And we have, you know, of course, I'm also working with, with Michael Krasney and we have
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:27.980]   a great guest this Friday.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:28.980]   I'm so excited.
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:31.500]   I can't wait to hear this.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:33.300]   So it's Leo LePort.
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:34.300]   Oh!
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:35.300]   Leo LePort's maybe on.
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:36.300]   Me!
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.300]   Yeah.
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:38.300]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:39.300]   Exactly.
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.300]   I hope you remember.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:41.300]   I do.
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:42.300]   It's in my calendar.
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:43.300]   So it's a Zoom call that I just call into and not video, right?
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:44.300]   Michael's an audio guy.
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:47.780]   It's a, it's a, it's video for the live, you know, for the folks that are members, you
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.100]   know, we're a member for like you do.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:51.060]   And so for those folks, it's, it's a live video.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.060]   But we only post the, the, okay.
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:54.060]   Okay, good.
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.060]   Well, I'll have it.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.340]   I'll, I'll get dressed then.
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:58.420]   And I will talk to Michael.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.460]   And if you're not a member, well, then you might want to join.
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:03.060]   And I'll let you know, Leo, you can come in from home.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:05.820]   You can also come to the, to the office if you want.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:08.940]   You just have to let me, you have to warn me if you want to come to the office.
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.020]   We, we record it now from the pit.
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:15.780]   You know that when you saw light and magic, they, they refer to the pit and that's where,
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:16.780]   that's where Michael will be.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:17.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:18.780]   If you want to come down, you're more than welcome to.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:19.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:20.780]   You could do, you could do the interview in the pit.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:21.780]   What?
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:22.780]   In Marin.
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:23.780]   In Marin.
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:25.420]   It's in center phone.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.500]   So it's, it's the old ILM stage.
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:33.100]   So we're, and it's the, it's the pit, you know, so it's a floated, uh, floated sound
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.100]   stage.
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.460]   Right now the person who has it is actually guitar player for a band called stroke nine.
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:38.460]   So many of us will remember.
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.260]   That's a pretty fancy.
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:41.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:43.780]   So I, so I, I'm working with John there.
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:48.180]   And so, um, anyway, so we're, we're now recording there just because I wanted to get good audio
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.180]   for Michael.
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:52.780]   And when we have people in the Bay Area, we fancy, wait him to come play.
[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:53.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.780]   Well, I might come down to the pill, bring Lisa if I do.
[02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:56.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:57.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:58.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:04:59.780]   Oh, how fun.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:00.780]   Yeah.
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:01.780]   Have fun.
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:02.780]   All right.
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:03.780]   Uh, and how can people hear this?
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:09.380]   You can go to, um, you can go to gray matter dot show gray matter dot show.
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:10.380]   That's the name of the show.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:11.380]   Yeah.
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:13.580]   Sounds like I'm going to have to be smart.
[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:15.980]   You know, I think, I think you would hold your own.
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:17.380]   I've, I've interviewed you before.
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:18.380]   I'm nervous.
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:19.380]   And it's really great.
[02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:22.380]   Michael is just, uh, such an amazing intercom.
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:23.380]   Long time.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:24.860]   Money is on public radio and San Francisco.
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:25.860]   It's only done legendary.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:26.860]   10,000 of them.
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:27.860]   Yeah.

[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:34.220]   What the?
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:35.220]   Yeah.
[02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:38.380]   She's, what he's going to want to hear me after all these guys.
[02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:40.860]   Andrew Frak, no, I could, dear friend.
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:42.540]   I just, I'm all the time.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:44.220]   Michael's, Michael's Roleodex is very.
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.220]   John McWhorter.
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.220]   Oh, wow.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.860]   Amber Mack.
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:48.860]   I know her.
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:51.100]   Oh, it sounds like this will be a lot of fun.
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:52.100]   I can't wait.
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:58.220]   He, he's a, he was a professor at San Francisco State, so he's very airy, you dight.
[02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:02.060]   And I've only been on a show once before a long time ago.
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:04.140]   And I used the phrase culture wars and I don't know.
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.780]   I think I may be misused it.
[02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:08.140]   So I hope he doesn't remember that.
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:10.300]   I think I think he's, he's excited to have you on.
[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:11.300]   Oh, no, he's not.
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:12.300]   Anyway, thank you.
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:17.300]   That's a cool gray matter dot, dot show, G-R-E-Y-M-A-T-T-E-R.
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.300]   Yeah, and you can do E or A.
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:20.300]   I'm smart.
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:21.300]   I'm smart.
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.300]   Good.
[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:23.300]   Let's take a look at that.
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:24.300]   We couldn't decide which one it was.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:25.300]   I was like, I think I better get both.
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:26.300]   Yeah.
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:31.300]   So, yeah, but, but it's E is, is gray matter with an E is technically the right one, but,
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:32.860]   but you can type either one.
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:34.500]   And office hours dot global.
[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:37.060]   And if you want to know more about that, go to that site.
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:42.300]   And if you want to hire Alex, because he brings all of this talent and skill can bring
[02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:47.540]   it to your production at 090 dot media.
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:48.540]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:49.540]   Thank you.
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:53.540]   Thank you, Andy and I co when will you be on GBH next?
[02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:57.860]   Well, I was scheduled for Thursday at 1245.
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:04.260]   I've been bumped by a, I won't name the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:07.300]   Let's say it's a governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:08.300]   Okay.
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:12.660]   I certainly thought that whatever they had to say was, was a more important to the people
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:14.820]   of New England than my 20 minutes of.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:19.300]   So, hey, I just got the new play date and I know it's got a crank on it.
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:20.540]   It's awesome.
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:22.140]   But next, so I've been, every reschedule.
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:24.220]   Did you get the new play date?
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.820]   I, I, my, my phase three order.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:28.660]   You didn't even mention this.
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:33.380]   Oh, I want this because because I need, I need to, I've, I wanted to talk about it this
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:35.220]   week, but I have to play with it another week.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:40.460]   I will give you a preview that that you know, you know how like they, the 20 or 24 games
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:42.140]   you get are by subscription.
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:45.460]   The first game they send you is kind of terrible.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:46.460]   Yes.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:47.460]   And so I was waiting.
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:48.940]   I mean, I mean, not terrible.
[02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:54.140]   It's just that it needs, it needs more instructions as one of those like sassy games is, you fail
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:55.140]   because you're an idiot.
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:58.540]   Like, no, I failed because you're not telling me what the game mechanics are or what I'm
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:07:59.540]   being scored for.
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:03.100]   But so, but I got the second weeks for the games and I'm going to play those.
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:04.100]   I'm going to basically.
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.620]   I have one to Jesus now.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:06.620]   I do.
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:07.620]   I've had one for a while.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:08.620]   I've got all the games.
[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:09.620]   It does get better.
[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:10.620]   It gets better.
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:11.900]   I've heard that.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:14.060]   Which one is the bad game?
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:17.180]   Uh, I once, I won't say bad.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:19.060]   I will say that it's a certain.
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:23.900]   It's great once you figure out how to play it, but it took me forever to figure it out.
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:24.900]   Exactly.
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:30.060]   It's just the mechanics seem to be very, very simple and you think that you, oh, wow, I
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.820]   just did the successful thing.
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:35.700]   And then it just animates, oh, well, you dumped because you're an idiot.
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:40.500]   I thought I flipped up and I did the spinny that I came back down again with the board
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:41.500]   and the right.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:42.500]   Okay.
[02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:43.500]   I guess you could help.
[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:44.500]   Oh, no, you're not going to help me.
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:45.500]   Okay.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:46.500]   That's fine.
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:47.500]   So that's funny.
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.500]   They send you, they could just load it up with all the games because they got them all.
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:54.220]   But no, they send you two games a week for twenty, twelve weeks or something.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.780]   But that was kind of exciting.
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:56.780]   It's better.
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:58.220]   I mean, I picked it is exciting.
[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:00.540]   That's one of the things that I will talk about next week.
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:06.180]   But I like, I like the idea that like you're just getting this, these, you're getting 20
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:10.380]   curated paid for games or being pushed onto the device two a week.
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:14.500]   And you don't know what necessarily, I'm not spoiling myself by looking ahead.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:19.220]   But I picked it up like today and to see if I needed a charge and gone, Hey, look, you've
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.260]   got, you've got two new games like already.
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:22.260]   Wow.
[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:23.260]   Tap the button.
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:24.260]   Life find stall.
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:26.740]   I'm like, Hey, look, those look like they're not going to make me want to throw this thing
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:27.740]   at a bus stop.
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:30.220]   You're having your half baked man.
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:32.580]   You're having all the games is overwhelming.
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:38.580]   It's actually really nice to only have the student games to explore every week.
[02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:40.700]   Jason Snell six colors.com.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:44.100]   You're going to want to check it out Thursday quarterly results.
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:45.260]   Yeah, it's true.
[02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:50.500]   Also, like Alex, I have colors with a you in it, but it just redirects you to the one

[02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.460]   I thought we should get non American friends.
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:59.660]   I thought we should get Twitter TV with an A in it, but then I realized, no, that's a
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:00.660]   bad.
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:01.660]   No, different TLD.
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:07.900]   So yeah, and it wasn't available as it turned out.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.380]   You will be on many podcasts.

[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:20.460]   We, I did a whole reviews, debrief over there and we have fun.
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:21.460]   We have a good time.

[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.380]   Have I mentioned that?
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:45.900]   And do a chilly season for a revenue.
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:49.620]   You're actually really is going to make a big difference, I think, I hope.
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:51.420]   But it will help if you join.
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:54.420]   Thank you everybody.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:55.660]   Have a wonderful week.
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:12:01.980]   We will be back next Tuesday as we always are 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:02.980]   When is the clock?
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:06.460]   The clock goes forward Sunday?
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:07.980]   It's after Halloween, right?
[02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:08.980]   It's after Halloween.
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:15.020]   So next Sunday, because the candy makers of America.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.020]   That's right.
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.020]   Big sugar.
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:20.420]   Big sugar wanted you to stay out later on Halloween.
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:22.100]   So we aren't changing until next Sunday.
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:26.220]   At that point, we will no longer be at 1800 UTC.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:28.340]   I'll have to do some other math.
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.380]   Some math will be involved and I will let you know.
[02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:31.900]   But right now we're at 1800 UTC.
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:32.900]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:36.740]   No, we're not because Europe went to summertime already.
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:37.740]   I mean, left summertime.
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:38.740]   Yeah, but UTC is UTC.
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:39.740]   UTC doesn't change.
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:40.740]   Oh, good.
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:41.740]   Thank you.
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.380]   We change, but UTC doesn't change.
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:45.340]   Yeah, British, the Brits go off.
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:46.340]   TMT to BST.
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.460]   But UTC is always.
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:50.380]   That's right.
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:53.020]   So that's why I give you UTC.
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:55.380]   But we do actually move the show.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:59.700]   UTC stays the same, but we spring forward or fall back.
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:00.940]   One or the other.
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:03.020]   And yeah, we're falling back.
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:04.500]   Yeah, which means UTC.
[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:05.500]   It's about hour back.
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:06.500]   I'll have to.
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:07.500]   They stole from us.
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:08.500]   Subtract.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:10.940]   It'll be minus seven instead of minus eight or something.
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:13.820]   And I would like to take this moment to remind people how stupid.
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.180]   Scaling taping.
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:17.580]   I bitch about it every year.
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:18.580]   Take this moment.
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:19.580]   We're so close now.
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:23.300]   We almost have there's almost enough people to just go, you know, why don't we do it?
[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:26.660]   You know, though, Alex, you know, the minute we get rid of it, everybody's going to bitch
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:28.700]   in a moment that we got rid of it.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:30.460]   It's so dark in the morning.
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.620]   Yeah, I'm back with those guys.
[02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:38.060]   Anyway, if you're a farmer in America in 2022, you have much, much bigger problems.
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:39.060]   Yes, that's true.
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:40.060]   Lavonam and Bissabickers.
