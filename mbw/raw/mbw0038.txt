[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Actually, it's 38.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Ah, yes, the gang is back.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Hail, hail, the gang's all here, Scott Bourne.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Welcome back from your trip down some rat hole or other.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Don't know where you were, but we're glad you're back.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I went back home to gig harbor for a few days,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   and now I'm back home in my new home in San Francisco,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and we're live at the Padango Production Studio.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Oh, you're in the studio.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   In the studio.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Every time you say gig harbor, I know that's in Washington state,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   but I always want to say gig harbor up in Maine, gig harbor.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But it's not the wrong place.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Alex Lindsey had his excuse.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He had his hall pass.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   He was at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and then Vancouver.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And then, did you go to Pittsburgh too?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Where else did you go?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, before that, I was in Pittsburgh and New York,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and then I went to Vegas, and then I went to Vancouver,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   and then I got home, and then I'm home until front of the couple days.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And then I'm off to Africa.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And Merlin, really?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We're going to do maybe get you on from South Africa if we can.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Merlin Mann was at Web 2.0.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yes, briefly, I stuck my head in to just to learn a little bit
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   about how we were going to be able to drill down as regards to
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   the Kimono opening.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I think really, you know, there was some exciting developments.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I know this isn't strictly Mac related,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   but some of the action that's happening in the application stack
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   space right now is really exciting.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   The application stack?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yeah, the application stack.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You know, that's really where it's all happening.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Also, tag is middleware.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Was there any middleware news?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Oh, God.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You know, Leo, middleware has never been more important,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   especially as we look into server-based tag solutions.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It'll scale across the enterprise.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   There was a lot of...
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Somebody just told me that Opera wants to eliminate the embed
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   in Object Tag and replace it with a video tag.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So there you go.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Wow.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We missed.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We took time off for the biggest story in some time,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   which means that Twit got to do all the analysis.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But I should bring it up because I'm sure you guys have something
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   to say about it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Steve Jobs, the SpinMeister added again announcing that,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   well, the iPhone just taking so much of our energies.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Good news, guys.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It has passed some of its tests.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We decided to transfer some engineers, some engineers from
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Leopard.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   That means Leopard won't be out till October.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Are you heartened or disheartened, Scott Bourne?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Well, I'm heartened that it looks like the iPhone's on schedule
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and frankly couldn't give a rip about whether or not Leopard
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   ever comes out.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The true spots come out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But I will say that I'm a little chagrinned
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   that they're picking on my beloved iPhone as the excuse,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and I'm starting to think that we're moving into VISTA creep here.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Does it pass the sniff test that Leopard would somehow have to
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   slip because the iPhone needs more work?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   What's I understand?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I think if you were working on integration issues between the
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   iPhone and the operating system, I think it would definitely make
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   sense.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But even though they call it OS10 on the iPhone, it's an
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   ARM chip on OS10.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   No, but the question is, is there's going to be tools on your
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Mac that are going to interrelate with the iPhone and doing
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   them in parallel may be difficult to try to figure out how
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   the phone is going to.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It might be better to get the phone done and then figure out
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   all those pieces.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I just think that trying to release both of them at the same
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   time would be very difficult.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I was, if they're going to do tight integration, which is what
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I'm hoping to see because I mean, of course, one of the things
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I'm really excited about is that, you know, we don't, uh, we
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   can actually use our phone with our computer, you know.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   No more missing sync.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   My Nokia, Apple, I mean, Nokia released new, I sync things
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   for the Nokia 93 and the 95 and it syncs great.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And my BlackBerry sync's great.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I've had no problems with that.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I think, I think syncing in total integration, I think, are
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   two different things.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   When is total integration mean beyond syncing?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, I think that, that really having a seamless, you know,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   syncing is like, I'm going to move everything over here.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I'm going to move everything back over there.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   But, well, I changed my context.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It changes on both sides.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But what if I couldn't be, I could access my, like when I plug
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   in my iPhone or I get near my computer with Bluetooth, it
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   popped up in my iCal and in my address book and in my, like, a
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   iPod.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I'm not, I'm not familiar with that.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Oh, sailing clicker is cool.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   If you've never used that, maybe I'll make that my software pick
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   for a Bluetooth phone.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's very cool.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'll talk about it later.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   All right.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So, it's a software pick.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So, so, I think that, I think that there's, I think it could
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   be tighter than just sync.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I think that really having that, that in integration where you're
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   able to move stuff around, you have access to all the files
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   really easily.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Right.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   So, I think that, I think that there's, I think it could be
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   tighter than just sync.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So, I think that's a great thing.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I think that's a great thing.

[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   The Apple's results just came out minutes ago.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   An analyst is saying now that they're going to sell a lot.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Ten times more phones than they predict.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   There are a couple analysts that think it could be as much as ten times more.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   There's just tons of different little stories popping up.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   We see that AT&T has decided to go after the enterprise market,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   even though Microsoft told them not to.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I don't see it as an enterprise phone.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I never did.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Well, it may not.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   But even without that, they think there's going to be pretty wide penetration.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I really think that this is going to be an iPod caliber product for the company.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I know that I'm allegedly too much of a fanboy to have a valid opinion.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   But I think if you take my fanboy hat off, even, I think this is going to be a big deal.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You know, I just want to point out that 70% of all humankind is well over a billion people.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That's a lot of seats.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   That's as many phones as we're sold total.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Last year.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Total.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I think it's possible that it's going to go.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I don't think anybody knows.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It could go either way.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It could be really out of the box.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Great word will spread very quickly.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I think they'll be in the first two weeks, a huge rush of people like Scott Bornhill
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   just buy it sight unseen.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Then everybody else will be kind of holding their breath waiting to hear.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And then the verdict will come out.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And it could be very good or it could be very bad.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I'll tell you what can screw it up right now.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Singular.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Well, that's obvious.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And certainly their capacity to screw it up is undisputed.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Yeah, I'm a little bit concerned.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   There's another internal AT&T singular memo that you probably didn't get that I got.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's their customer service model, which is we're not happy till you're not happy.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It changed it officially.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So I'm a little worried about that part.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   But assuming they don't drop the ball, it'll be a huge hit.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And if they do, well, it'll end up like the newton.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I'll bet you one thing.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I think the price is going to be a little bit of a factor.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I think if there's some kind of a price break.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's not going to be.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Yeah, it is me too.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I spent a lot of money.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I mean, I just got that M95.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Maybe that's why I just got that M95.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Well, I'm not currently a singular person.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And I mean, as much as I hate to admit it, I mean, I'm kind of servile to sprint at this
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   point because I have a lot of skin in the game with buying their trio.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Right.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So I'm, you know, I can't be spending $600 a year on phones.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I hate talking on the phone.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So it doesn't really scale for me to spend that kind of money over time.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   So I don't know.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.720]   I mean, but you could you see them buy something like probably not by Christmas maybe, but
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.000]   could you see the price dropping in the next six months or a year, do you think?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I think you see that.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Do you do it?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Would they do it in concert with introducing a new model?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   They'll do the same exact thing they did with the iPod, right?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   They got the one model, but then they quickly come out.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   How long did it take before they set the job iPod?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   What are we talking about the nano that, or the idea of a iPhone shuffle?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   iPhone shuffle.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I know.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   He's clicking randomly.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   He gets somebody.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's my mom.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Sir.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Sorry mommy again.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Joe's pizza.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Yep.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.440]   That's clearly Apple thinks this is the next big category.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.280]   And I think that this announcement from Apple is telegraphing at very clearly, and it scares
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.680]   me that they are much more interested in the consumer electronics market and they're willing
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.880]   to let leopard slip because, I mean, here, there's a couple of ways you can interpret
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   this one.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   There's such a brinky ding company.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.720]   They can't afford to take 10 engineers off leopard to put it on the iPhone.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   That's not good.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   Two.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   Make it friends all over Cooper.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.800]   Well, all of them are negative.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.480]   They spun it as best they could, but that every interpretation of this is negative.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.400]   Two, the iPhones in such trouble they needed to do this.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.240]   Three leopards in such trouble they needed to do this or a combination of all three.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.040]   I still think it has to do with the integration.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.600]   I'll quote the always quotable John Gruber over at Daring Fireball, who said something
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   that I thought was really smart and you guys kind of alluded to this a little bit.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.080]   But these are all devices that are going to be running on OS 10.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.680]   And so I mean, I think one of the things that all the fanboys freaked out about was, oh,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.920]   clearly, this is going to be the nail in the coffin of Apple as a computer company.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.280]   And I just don't believe that.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.040]   I think it's a company that's building, pardon me, I think it's a company that's building
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.400]   out a lot of stuff based on their operating system.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   I don't think we know.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.600]   I think the problem is that Apple could be at this point going for the gold.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.680]   The board could be saying stockholders could be saying, hey, look how much money we made
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.880]   on the iPod.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.120]   Let's try to do it again.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.440]   Create a new category.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   Take over.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.240]   I mean, the iPod was at from day one.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.440]   I'm reading Steven Levy's book, the perfect thing, which is a great book about the iPod
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   from day one.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.120]   The goal of the iPod was let's conquer this category by doing because it's not being done
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.160]   well and we can do it so much better.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   We can conquer it.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   They did it.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.440]   Now, imagine the amount of you Apple that I mean, Cupertino's already full of hubris,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.800]   the amount of hubris generated by that.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.000]   Hey, here's another category.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.480]   Billion phones sold last year.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.240]   Let's conquer that category.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.400]   And oh, yeah, we got a computer business, but hey, this is much more interesting.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.200]   But the computer business keeps on getting bigger.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.400]   I mean, if we look at sales, it's not like the sales of the sales of their computers
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   is dropping.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.160]   They're sending in the market.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.880]   I mean, they just released an eight-prock machine.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.080]   It's a I don't think that they're slowing down as far as the development of that process.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   And we read N.E.B.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.480]   talking about looking at their brand new.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.080]   You vote for the point of view that Apple is such a ring-eating company.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.360]   They can't both develop an iPhone.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.560]   No, I vote for someone who has to deal with lots of integration and lots of moving parts.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.920]   I vote for the fact that the cell phone, they need to sort out the cell phone issues
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.560]   before they can finish the integration stuff that they want to do to make sure that the
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.640]   experience is really good within Leopard.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.360]   I think that they want to do extra stuff that's there.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   Well, look kind of agreeing then.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.080]   You're saying Leopard is taking is kind of secondary to the success of the iPhone.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.680]   You're saying that Leopard follows iPhone?
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.520]   Well, I think that you just have to figure out which one is going to be done first and
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.600]   then you're going to do one and the iPhone I think is going to make more money than Leopard.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.280]   And I think that that makes a lot of it.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.560]   I think that had to do with something with we have to figure out how this little thing
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.120]   is going to work so that this bigger thing is getting the phone because of the electronics
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.080]   is much more complicated to get it to work.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.000]   So that has to be the thing that you have to figure out how to make it work because it's
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.640]   so low grade, generally low grade electronics and much dumber electronics than what you
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640]   have in the computer.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.560]   So you figure the one out that has the most constraint and then you have the one that
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.040]   has the has less constraint and you sort that one out against it.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   That would be I can definitely see that that would be a reasonable issue as the process
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   moves forward.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.480]   I think we've got to wait and see how much functionality to put in the iPhone because
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.120]   really all we've seen from the iPhone is candy.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.960]   I'd really like to take for me.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.680]   I'd really like to take the cellular functionality out of it.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.840]   I don't really care about that.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   I mean, I really don't.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.160]   I really like people buy phone.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   I get bad news.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.080]   No, no, no, but I mean, I'm just saying I don't spend a lot of time on the phone.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.960]   I want everything else that the phone does with the ability to do voice over IP.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   I think you're unusual.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.880]   I think most people who buying the iPhone don't care about the music and all that stuff.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   They want a phone.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.320]   Well, I think they might.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.640]   I just think that as with VoIP, for me, I'd be very happy with that because everything
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.000]   that we've seen so far looks like singular is going to block the VoIP or Apple is going
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.680]   to block the VoIP for singular.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.280]   So we're not going to be able to use voice over IP.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.360]   We're going to be stuck with using singular.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.480]   I don't really care about that.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.800]   I'd much rather have a cheap little phone because I do mostly SMS and all that other
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.440]   stuff, but I'd rather have a cheap little phone that I keep in my bag that I answer every
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.360]   once in a while and then have this thing that has all the other stuff that it does.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.840]   And if it's integrated, it's integrated.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.320]   I'm not that interested in going to singular to be honest.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.920]   I don't think singular would agree with that approach.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.920]   No, I don't think so.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   It's their business.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.880]   Why do they wouldn't?
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.920]   And I mean, it says they need a carrier to get this thing to market.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.360]   And I think it seems like they've Apple's done pretty well in terms of the what who gave
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.160]   away what to get where they are.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.120]   What are the features of the iPhone that are going to make refresh my memory?
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.080]   Well, what are the features that it knows because the phone is inshipping you.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   Is it a great camera?
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   We don't know.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Is it?
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.320]   I mean, it's a great music player.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.520]   It's a better iPod than the iPod.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.480]   Well, it's something to repeat myself.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.400]   Something I said before is that cell phones or mobile phones are something that we're
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.200]   all using all the time now.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.760]   It's no longer an option for most people whether you want to have them.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.320]   To the point where, if you're like me, I don't even really use a home phone anymore.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   I have basic functionality to get voice calls to my mobile.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.880]   But I think for most people, this has become the phone that they have.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.640]   We can all agree as one that most of our experiences with cell phones have been vociferously awful.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.040]   Just really terrible, terrible experiences.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.840]   Like I've said, often my sprint phone sometimes feels like the result of a business development
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.320]   meeting that happens to be inside of a phone.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.400]   There's nothing in terms of the functionality being integrated.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.160]   That's why I think it is important that the OS work really optimally because having all
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.120]   those pieces work together, I mean, for example, even on the trio, which I love, how is it that
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.840]   there's nothing like MultiFinder, that there's nothing like copy and paste?
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   Does that ever drive you crazy?
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.880]   There's no way to get information from one place to another.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.720]   And I just have to imagine that if this is based on OS 10, there's going to be ways
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.000]   where that stuff's all going to work together.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.240]   I mean, setting aside all the other little babbles and stuff, as long as it gets a good
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.440]   signal, is an iPod and is not a terrible experience, I think it's going to be a win just with
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   that.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   For 600 bucks.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.960]   Dude, people are paying a lot of money for these things.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.760]   And you remember when the iPod came out and people were like, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.800]   buy an MP3 player for $500?
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.440]   Yeah, that's going to happen."
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.800]   And then people did and then the price went down and now they're paying $90 for an MP3
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   player.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   So what's our consensus?
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.000]   This announcement, no big deal?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.200]   Are you saying it's not a problem?
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.840]   I think people, I mean, just the responses on some of the Mac sites, I was on the Mac
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.520]   user podcast with those guys a week ago.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   Very cool guys.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   Oh, so that's where you were.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.520]   Oh, we see how you are.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.880]   When my Mac break team is out of town, I go wander.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.840]   But no, but we were just talking about this.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   And the response for the one you're with is that, "Your opinion, Mr. Man."
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   I'm not going to take my relationship advice from Steven Stills.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.480]   No, but the response from people has just been apoplectic.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.400]   People are just out of their mind and they think that now there's this taint on the entire
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.720]   company because clearly, you can read in the tea leaves that this means they're going
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.600]   to abandon making computers.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   And I think one thing you got to be clear about, this actually is in some ways good for
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   developers.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.840]   It sucks for developers who have hung their next release on Leopard, which they maybe
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.120]   shouldn't have done anyway.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.160]   But what it does mean is that they get a feature complete beta in June to build on so
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.880]   that when the stuff, when it really does come out and I thought maybe that's a finished
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.280]   and polished product versus.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.160]   Can you imagine if this thing came out?
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.160]   And I don't know if you've had a chance to look at Leopard, but it's not ready.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   It's not ready.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.080]   Well, and the one positive spin I've heard on this is Steve Jobs took a look at Visten
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.880]   and said, "Don't worry guys, there's no hurry.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.840]   You got all the time, take your time.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.080]   Vistas sucks."
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.000]   And that might be really the positive spin is, "Apple wanted to take this time all along,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.680]   needed this time and there's no urgency anymore."
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.120]   And there might be another lesson there because they saw how Microsoft was able to get away
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.920]   with a 23 year delay in this.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.160]   Yeah, right, didn't hurt them.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.600]   Actually, there's a lot of negatives on Vista, by the way.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.120]   People are really, seem to be.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   Really?
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.440]   And you have, you have up till now been very complicated.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.000]   I like it.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.280]   As Dvorak pointed out, the people who seem to like Vista Bester Apple users, when those
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.400]   users don't seem to be too happy with it.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   What are you hearing?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.720]   Oh, there's all sorts of compatibility issues.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.680]   If you're upgrading an older machine nightmare, if you have older hardware and software potential
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.360]   problems, but that's always to be expected, we might even see that with Leopard.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.160]   We've certainly seen that before with other versions of OS X.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.120]   And the really larger issue that's still kind of hanging out there with Vista is, is
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.480]   it more secure?
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.120]   And a number of security researchers, including one who works for Microsoft recently said,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.080]   "Hey gang, there's going to be exactly the same problems on this platform.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.800]   Don't expect it to be secure."
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.480]   And frankly, I'm not one of those, I used to be.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.680]   I'm no longer one of those Apple people who say Apple doesn't have to worry.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:47.240]   And partly that's because last week you probably saw it, the zero day Safari exploit guy, $125,000
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.360]   finding a unpublicized cross script exploit in Safari.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.840]   It affects all of that.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.920]   Yeah, but it isn't like they got root access by SSHing in.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.440]   It was, you have to navigate to, I'm not trying to excuse it.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.640]   But many of the Windows exploits are exactly that.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.680]   You navigate to a negative site and they can install a Trojan horse in your system.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.160]   That's probably the largest class of Windows exploits.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.200]   So the point is, I think pretty clear that we've been escaping mostly because we're a
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   minority.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   You know, I...
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.840]   Okay, so the only thing I've got to say about that, I heard somebody really smart once
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.440]   once told me that what you do in life, the things that happen to you in life, don't
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.280]   mean nearly as much as the way that you respond to them and the way that you respond to things
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.920]   ultimately is the telling thing about a person's character.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.520]   Mr. Miyagi, I'm impressed.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.680]   That's on Wexoff.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Wexoff.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   I know we're going to get philosophical here.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.240]   I've got the spiritual depth of a toaster struggle.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.400]   Here's the thing though.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.920]   And I think this is where there is a difference.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.920]   I mean, yeah, so of course everybody's going to be attacked, but I mean, I think the record
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.280]   to date has shown that obviously it's not like firefox, you're not going to see releases
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.280]   like overnight, but that Apple has tended to be a bit more restricted.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.520]   Now, I don't know.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.960]   I don't think there's...
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.520]   I was in your court for a long time, but we are with the month of Apple bugs and now
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.920]   this latest Safari thing.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.800]   You think they're trying to sweep it, sweep it under the rug?
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   No, but I think the case has been pretty clearly proven that there are the similar kinds of,
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.280]   almost identical kinds of flaws in OS X.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   Of course, there's lots of flaws in Unix and Darwin and Apple just shipped what 12 fixes,
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   right?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.680]   Yeah, software update.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.320]   Dude, run your software update.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   No, I did.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.320]   No, I always do.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   I just don't...
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   Yeah, there was a big...
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   I'm a Mac user.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   I don't read that.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.680]   Well, they shipped 12 fixes and my sense of them is that many of them were critical.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.080]   So these flaws exist.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.000]   No, I'm not saying Apple is slower or faster to repair than Microsoft, probably faster.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.080]   But I think the question is why do we feel safer on the Apple platform?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.080]   And I think we might be living in a full spare dies.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.280]   And my market share could be a problem.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.080]   We know where you're living.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.800]   Sunset, I think, I fool paradise.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.560]   Not much difference, I'll be honest.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:12.840]   But I will say that I think that the natural size, market size of Apple's base would probably...
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.080]   I'd be very surprised if it went over 10 or 15% ever.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   I just don't think that's the...
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   You know, I just don't think that's the...
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.760]   Just a few years ago or maybe a few months ago that it would be 20% sometime soon, 30%.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.320]   We're not seeing any growth.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.320]   Do you mind?
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   I don't mind.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.160]   I think it's great to be a minority.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.000]   But I think by being the minority, I think that that's part of the issue is that you're
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   starting to get to a point where we're not interesting.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.760]   We're not going to be interesting until we get to 30%, 40%.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.200]   And so, you know, maybe we are living in a full spare dies, but we really aren't that
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   interesting.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   You can't do the kind of things that you want to do.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.960]   I think that is also a big thing with your way to security.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   You mean your time, hackers can't?
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   If you want to do a denial service or whatever...
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   No, you need Windows.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   You're bad.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   and machines.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.900]   The other thing is, is that I think that, one of the things that I do notice is that
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.680]   there's a lot of things that on PC that you can do from an administrator level from somewhere
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   else.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.140]   You know, there's a lot of access that, you know, with.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.280]   With the Mac, it seems like every time you want to put something on, you know, something
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:16.000]   in, in the OS, you need to, you need to get an approval from the person who's running the
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   computer, um, it's not always the case.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.480]   But I think that it's that's, that's so-
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.520]   That's just so, that this cross site scripting flaw.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   Right.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   Is, you didn't.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.240]   But I mean, I think that, that there are so many gates that are shut that way that I
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   think are open on the window side.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   Oh, I agree.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.520]   And I, and for a long time I've said that, but I have a feeling, well, first of all,
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.440]   they're not open anymore on Windows.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.280]   And, and I think what we're learning is that, that many of these flaws can escalate.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.160]   There are all sorts of escalation.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   That's what they call this.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   When you escalate privilege from a limited user to a full user without permission of the
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   user.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   All right.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.040]   And I think that, you know, I don't know.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   I think this is why Linux is really going to, it's going to take over.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   Well, and that's the other point.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   I think people are going to say, you know what?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   It's going to take over.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.320]   It's like, why am I bothering?
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.080]   I could just do all of this in Emacs.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   I think that's what we're going to see.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.560]   We're going to see if we move on.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.520]   A lot of people are going to say, what, what, the security of 30 year old softball I'm going
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   to move to.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.720]   Just, I mean, Apple's announcement today, Steve Jobs says the Mac is clearly gaining
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.360]   market share with sales growing 36%.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.480]   Now, reality distortion guys, sales growing 36% doesn't mean great gain in market share
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.000]   because we don't, you know, although he does say it's more than three times the industry
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   growth rates.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   But they did, did they quote market share numbers?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I don't know.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   They have people.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.960]   I mean, there have been other groups and I can't have them right in front of me that
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.680]   have been quoting almost on a quarterly basis that Apple is increasing by, you know, 0.2,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.360]   0.3%, yeah.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.520]   So it's the market share.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.800]   It has been, they have been gradually going on.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600]   One and a half million max shipped in the March quarter.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   That's 36% growth.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.400]   10.5 million iPods, 24% growth.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.520]   Apple shares jumping.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.720]   You'll be glad to know Scott born 8% in the after hours trading there now up to $103.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.520]   Ah, baby, baby, baby.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.400]   Remember when I said that $100 number, everybody's gone.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.880]   That $100 mark gross profit margins, 35% that start that Ray Mora ranch.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.880]   He's been wanting to start.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.840]   I'm going to move to Montana.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.920]   I'm going to raise meals.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.800]   That income $770 million.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.040]   That's 87 cents a share.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   Wow.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   Compared to 47 cents.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   Same quarter last year.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.200]   Oh, get me Mr. dividend on the phone, please.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.360]   But now all amongst all these numbers, I think something very important is missed because
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.240]   remember, Steve's telling the analysts this and I presume it's a phone call.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.200]   I don't know how they did it.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.520]   Usually, it's a phone call with the analysts.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.760]   One of the things he said, which I thought was very interesting and gadget reported this,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.560]   Apple promises to quote surprise and delight users of both the iPhone and Apple TV with
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.280]   new applications and software features.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.760]   If they go along, many of which will be free.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.600]   They noted they are now using subscription accounting, which avoids that $2 that they
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   had to charge for the $8 to $2.11.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.560]   The fact that they're choosing that is in effect saying, hey, we plan to give you new
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.400]   features automatically.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   So that's very interesting.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.800]   That's been a real, I've talked to some developers close to Apple and that has been a big issue
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.560]   for them is that they literally can't add a new feature to their pro apps, their base
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.520]   apps or whatever without charging for it.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.920]   It's just been driving them crazy because they don't need.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.960]   That's Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.520]   It's just a night.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.080]   That sounds like just a crazy thistle.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   That whole Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.200]   Well, and then there are some accounting experts who say no, no, Apple is not as being ridiculously
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.640]   scrupulous, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.000]   But in any event, the fact that they're shifting to the subscription accounting is good.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.880]   It means that they can do these upgrades.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.440]   Can I do a segue?
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   Yes.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.280]   Speaking of subscriptions, did you guys see the story about Apple?
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.080]   I'm so bad.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.440]   No, it's better if you don't announce that you're going to do it and then do it.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.800]   Just come right into it.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   It's okay, Merlin.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   You can do it.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.440]   Well, anyway, I was just reading earlier about subscriptions.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.880]   It's supposed to be that now they're saying that Apple, I want to find this link, but probably
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.480]   in MBW ideas, but that Apple is going to be the one putting pressure on the rest of
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.160]   the Big Four to also join EMI in the end.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.320]   They expect all these majors to come to Apple with the whole Wait for it, Alex, subscription
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.800]   idea that they expect that anyway, there should be a lot of interesting things happening
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   on both sides.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.640]   Switching for subscriptions and Apple pushing for take the DRM.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.400]   How would you build subscriptions into iTunes if you were going to?
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.400]   I think it's really complicated.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.680]   I think you would almost need to have a second site or to say or to have just merely an indication
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.880]   that says this track K, this track would be included if you were already a subscriber.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.200]   The hard part is could you get everybody on board because in order for it to be really
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.080]   valuable, you kind of have to have almost all of that music included, right?
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.640]   That was one of the neat things about the Zoom was you just, here I have an empty device
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.520]   and I don't have any WMA music, but I just ragged albums over.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.320]   I'm guessing it's exceptions that are hard to deal with.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.920]   If everybody's included, it's not hard, but yeah, I'm not sure how.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.680]   I think you could have them identified.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   You have a button.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.640]   You have a standard, it's just a little button that says get free with subscription or whatever.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.320]   There could be a little button that wants you to know what it is or little ones in red
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.400]   or blue or listed in a certain way and people will catch on pretty quickly.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.600]   Is anybody using a subscription music service?
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.240]   I want to.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.440]   I just don't want to get another player.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   Right.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.240]   I didn't really get it until I tried and I only had the Zoom for a couple of weeks, but
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.520]   it was just a really nice feeling.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.640]   It's like going into a music store and on a shopping spree.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.600]   You anything, you go, oh yeah, I'll take, oh, I like that.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.840]   And if you get Gil Scott Heron and you like one, but you don't like the other, no big
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   deal.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   I like that.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   It's really fun.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.720]   Well, and I think the viral nature of it, the playlist really take on a whole new level
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.320]   of teeth, you know, when you can just click on it and download them all to your player.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   Sure.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   I'd say I want Alex's stuff.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   Just give me all Alex's stuff.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   That's an interesting question.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.320]   Thanks.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.400]   Do you guys ever do anything with iMixes on iTunes?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.120]   Do you ever make them or use them?
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.120]   So you use them.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.240]   I use them as recommendations on what to buy.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.720]   How do you choose who you're going to follow?
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.960]   For instance, I looked at Stings and I like his music.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   Oh, yeah, that would be good.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   I picked all of his music.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.800]   But you don't use the user generated mixes, just the celebrity.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   I ended up using a few of them because I was listening to some John McLaughlin vintage
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.120]   stuff from the Mahavishnu Orchestra album.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.120]   Oh, yeah, baby.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   Deep catalog, my friend.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.120]   Oh, good stuff.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   That is deep catalog.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   And there was a guy who had built this entire cool list of similar guitar players, Al Demiol
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.840]   and a bunch of other people.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.000]   And I ended up spending like 50 bucks going through the whole deal.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.640]   But just think what you have done if you had a subscription, you can get them all.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.040]   Yeah, but I just have a question about the subscription thing.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.000]   I remember Alex kind of going off against subscriptions.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.280]   And I want to know what changed his mind.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.400]   Well, I wouldn't want to do subscriptions by itself.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.560]   I think that what I what I what I like is the idea that that I could get a lower quality
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.800]   subscription 96 bit or something like that.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.720]   And just have everything that I want.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:19.960]   And then I could have a higher quality subscription, a higher quality, you know, 256 bit DRM free
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.480]   that I could buy.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.760]   It just it's just that what I don't want is one or the other.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.760]   What I want is both.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.200]   And I'll tell you, if I were to both that would really work.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.800]   If I were an artist, I might be against the subscription because it does devalue the music.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.760]   It makes it be a wallpaper because if you well, wait a minute, think about it.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.480]   If you love something, you want to buy it, you want to own it.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.600]   But if it's wallpaper, you just it's a lot of sampling, right?
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.040]   And I think subscription really lends itself more to that wallpaper.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.600]   You're saying there's no incentive.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   Well, you don't own it.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   A buying event.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   Yeah, you don't own it.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.200]   I mean, I think there is though, because if I really once again, if it's 96 bit.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   You still buy some free.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   Well, it says it's 96 bit.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.200]   I'm just saying that's my suggestion.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.840]   But it's not my suggestion.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.440]   That's not how they do it on on Windows.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   I mean, it's full.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   They do it.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.960]   Yeah, but they also don't have that you can't buy it either.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.360]   I mean, I guess you can't wrap city and let you buy them as well.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   I can't remember.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   I think it does.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.880]   But the point is, is that is that I don't want, I guess as an artist, I think that that
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.480]   maybe big artists is one way or the other.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.400]   But for a smaller artist, the idea that people are sampling your music and theoretically
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.440]   you're getting money for that sample, you know, make a difference because the way, I
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   mean, I don't know how they're going to account for all of this stuff.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.280]   But typically what you'd want to do is you'd want to account for it by saying, well, there's
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.800]   X number of people paying a subscription.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   They're paying 20 in there.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.840]   So let's say the pot is $10 million and we're committing whatever the number is 60, 70,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:42.600]   80% of the revenue to the copyright holders, which a lot of times is the record companies.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.760]   But the, so the royalties are getting fed back into it based on the number of downloads
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.920]   of that specific song.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.320]   It means that an individual artist could do very, very well just from viralness.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.800]   You know, people don't have to go out and apply.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.040]   That's, if I could finish that my incredibly squirrely idea where this started.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.200]   When I brought up I mix is the reason I mentioned that, wouldn't it be intriguing if you apply
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.280]   and I know, because Scott's going to hate even the idea of this.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.560]   But hearing, you know, you know how you like, when you're streaming over the web, there's
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.480]   certain rules for how often you can play a song and da, da, da, and you can't play by
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.560]   the same artist, so many songs and so on.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.760]   What if they came up with something where it was just to capitalize on the viral nature?
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.200]   Or you could create eye mixes of any stuff that was available on iTunes.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.320]   And I haven't really thought this out, so this may not make sense.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.000]   But what if you could create eye mixes of anything that's on iTunes and then people
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.800]   could go and listen to that and could go like stream that or could I guess potentially somehow
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.640]   with DRM or whatever, get it on their iPod.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.160]   But if you couldn't have say more than end songs by an artist or more than end songs from
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.640]   the same album, but you give people this thing where you're basically creating mixtapes for
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.280]   people, which everybody agrees is a good way to get music to people.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:53.160]   So the idea is you're not cheating on the whole idea of buying a record or buying a
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.320]   whole CD, but you do create this way for people to share music they think is great.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.280]   And then it becomes this whole community thing too, where people could come in and it becomes
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.400]   almost like, nah, I don't know, like dig or whatever, where you come in and you start
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.640]   following somebody who you use music you like.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.560]   Why do you think I would be against that, Merlin?
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.160]   Well, no, no, because didn't they really go after you in the mid 90s with all that crazy,
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.880]   was this before the crazy rules about how you could start?
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.240]   Yeah, see, here's the thing, I was legal.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.000]   I worked on a deal with ASCAP before anybody even knew what NetRadio was, so I was legit.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It wasn't...
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.960]   Would you think something like that would something like that make sense and have any
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   value?
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.920]   Because I'm just thinking, well, what they're trying to avoid is some kind of, you know,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.520]   kind of work around where you can like get a bunch of music without buying it.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.120]   Well, here's the thing to think about.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.000]   This change is what kind of licensing agreements they're going to make.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.080]   And I think that's one of the most interesting aspects of this.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.720]   There's a huge difference in what you pay for a performance license and what you pay
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.360]   for a distribution or publishing license.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.200]   So if they move to a subscription service where you don't get to own the music, they
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.760]   might be able to successfully argue that this is a mere performance as in the terms
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.840]   of the existing performance license at ASCAP CSAC and VMI.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.040]   And boy, howdy, are we talking about a whole different game than they don't have to pay
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.960]   nearly as much?
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.400]   Well, that's something the record industry might not like.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   I would think they would not like it.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   Interesting.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.040]   I can tell you that the people behind the other side of the ball will think it's great.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   The performers.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.560]   I mean, the people who are having to pay those fees are getting killed by them.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.400]   In fact, you know, frankly, there is no more net radio business because of all the rules
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.320]   that came about in the late '90s after I was fortunate enough to have sold all my stock
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   and my company.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.520]   Well, you know, and of course, you know what's happening with internet radio now.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.840]   And part of the problem is they want performer royalties.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.120]   And there's no business there.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   There's nothing there.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.000]   It completely destroyed it in their greed, in my opinion.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.080]   Well, it seems like they wanted to because this retroactive, you know, is basically saying,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.840]   "And by the way, you owe us for 2006.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.320]   Pay up or shut up."
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.120]   And it's all about really, I think, what they want to do is protect their old distribution
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.120]   models that they're all safe with and they're all comfortable with and where they've got
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.280]   the big sweetheart deals.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.960]   I think that's what it's really about.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.520]   And see you later, dudes, because it's over.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520]   Totally.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   It's a knucklehead industry.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.440]   That is a good thing I sold my stock.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.680]   It's too bad because internet radio, well, I mean, what we do is internet radio and talk
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.880]   radio is not going away.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.280]   Internet talk radio will flourish because of this.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   But think about this.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:27.520]   Arbitron did a study two days ago, Leo, 11% of the radio listening public has listened
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.400]   over the internet.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.760]   This is something they couldn't even do 12 years ago.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   Right.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.760]   Right.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.280]   That's a huge sea change.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.760]   It's, it's, anyway.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.320]   Anyway, I don't want to get it.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.400]   We should, we could do a whole separate show just about, I mean, it seems like we, it's
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   the singularity.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:49.040]   We keep coming back to like this as a consumer, just trying to get your head around why different
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.240]   aspects of these industries operate the way they do.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.760]   It's just, it's completely baffling to me.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.680]   Well, I think we, we made one mistake.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.720]   We should have played the rat hole music quite soon.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.760]   No, this is not a rat hole.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.160]   But getting back to the financial news from Apple real quickly, the other financial story,
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   big financial story in the Wall Street Journal today, our friend Steve Steklow contributing
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   to that.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.960]   I think Steve got a Pulitzer for his coverage.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.920]   He and his co-author for his coverage of these stock options.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.880]   They stop, stock options scandal.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.800]   A big kind of a surprise, frankly, Fred Anderson settled with the SEC.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.240]   He was the former CFO of Apple, forced out at the Apple board because of this options
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.040]   back dating.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.720]   He settled with the SEC, kind of got off the hook.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:41.480]   And then for reasons unknown comes back and said, oh, by the way, Steve Jobs told me to
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   do it.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:48.240]   He misled him in implicating jobs who has been up to now been kind of safe.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.760]   The SEC said, well, the Apple's been so forthcoming.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.000]   We don't have, we don't have any problem.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.280]   But does this, is this trouble for Steve Jobs?
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.840]   Is this trouble for Apple?
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.400]   Well the board today came out and said, well, how many times have we heard a crook point
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.480]   a finger at somebody else and said, I didn't do a judge.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   He did.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.480]   But interesting thing is he didn't have to.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   He'd already gotten off.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.280]   Well, we don't know, frankly, what the conditions or terms of his deal were.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.000]   It might have been that they built this into the whole thing.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   But the board said, we're sticking with Jobs.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.160]   This guy's lying or something to that effect.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.880]   Jobs said all along, I didn't, Jobs gets off the hook.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.560]   I don't understand the accounting implications of back dating.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   I didn't at the time.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.040]   So you can't blame me.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.560]   Fred Davis says, not only did he understand, I warned him about it.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   Well, at this point, Fred Davis is another guy.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.560]   Fred's an old friend.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   I'm sorry, Fred.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.560]   I didn't mean to duplicate you.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.120]   You have nothing to do with this.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.800]   Next week, Fred Davis is, Fred, Fred, you may remember as editor, I think, of a Mac
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.200]   user magazine is certainly a long time back.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.280]   In the most puzzling episode of Mac Break, Quickly Did Case, we all completely loses
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.840]   his mind and starts accusing his friends of crime.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.040]   Absolutely nothing to do with back dating at all.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.880]   Chris Perrillo, I've never trusted him.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.680]   Perrillo, I knew he did it.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.400]   Fred Anderson, the former CFO.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.040]   Did I say Davis the whole time or just that one time?
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.040]   I think just once.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   How's that once?
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   That's the most.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.280]   So they sparred too much for me to fix this in post.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.360]   You're getting what you're getting.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.800]   I think that once again, if we're really looking at the shareholders' best interests,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.480]   I don't see any reason why they would go after Steve Jobs.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:34.600]   It's going to be hard to convince anybody to do that because nevertheless, it doesn't
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.960]   mean they won't pursue it.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.840]   The last US attorney was an idiot and he got fired.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.360]   It doesn't really, he was going after press.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.920]   It was a good thing to get.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.600]   That's what you do as a US attorney.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.840]   You go out and get press so that you can move on to being a judge or a representative
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.040]   or whatever else you're going to do.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.640]   And so accusations are pretty nasty.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.200]   He said that Jobs misled him telling him that Apple's board had given prior approval, even
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.880]   though it hadn't.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   Something happened here.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.960]   I think I think one could argue that he feels jilted.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.800]   Yeah, I think it sounds more like bitterness.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.160]   Jilted lover.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.960]   It could be the old kind of disgruntled ex-employee thing.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:21.200]   The timing is odd since it came after a settlement had been announced.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.640]   And you know what, it could all be true, but the net net effect is that it doesn't seem
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   to matter.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   Right.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.040]   So you think Jobs is an ill-scate because nobody understands it anyway?
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.440]   I think they're scared of him because he shoots laser beams from his eyes.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.720]   Well, his gross income is something like three times the domestic product of 24 other countries.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.400]   So they probably figured he's got enough to battle him and be okay for a while.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.840]   I think it's also that it's just really easy to go after a company as it's imploding because
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.960]   of all the stuff that was done like an Enron or something like that.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.680]   But Apple's got a pop-up.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   They just keep on going up.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.200]   The stock hold has been heard.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.760]   Nothing but benefit.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.320]   You know, who's been heard?
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   And that's the key issue.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.320]   Alex just brought it up.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:09.200]   The Securities and Exchange Commission's number one charge is to protect the average investor.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.680]   And so everything they do is supposed to be guided by the investors get heard.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.480]   Obviously in Enron, people got screwed.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.080]   So they went to town.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.160]   But anybody who owns Apple stock is just getting richer.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.320]   I think there's a Latin phrase.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.240]   Who has been heard us?
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   Brutus.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   Brutus.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   Who has been heard us?
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:36.680]   Apple's been sued over what appears to be tabbed dialogue boxes.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.480]   Oh my gosh.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   IP.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.480]   What?
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.400]   Over tabbed dialogue boxes.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.400]   A patent holding company called that and that's a nice way to put it.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:52.120]   Apple IP innovation claims that Apple has engaged in willful and deliberate violations
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.920]   of US patent 5,072,412.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.480]   The patent describes a computer operating system interface with quote, "work spaces provided
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:07.280]   by an object-based user interface appear to share windows and other display objects."
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.640]   Does that mean they're going after Adobe for the tabbed interface?
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   Well everybody uses it.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.840]   Yeah, everybody uses it.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   These guys.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   I mean the patent comes from Xerox.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.280]   They bought it.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.080]   And the Xerox patent goes back to 1984.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:29.400]   And the idea as best anybody can figure it out is basically tabs or maybe like in the
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.720]   system preference pane the buttons that you can choose different control panels.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.040]   And I can tell you where Xerox got it, they got it from Epson.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   Oh really?
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.320]   Epson created this originally with a system called Vowdox.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   Wow.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.880]   And I worked on that system a little bit.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.200]   So this actually goes way back to the CPM days.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.160]   Vowdox was a GUI that ran on top of CPM.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.720]   And they sold that patent Xerox who in turn sold it to whoever.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.080]   But I think it's a process patent guys.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.640]   And process patents are not doing so well in front of the court these days.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.280]   Alright, so Apple.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.640]   I just, I really think this is such a manipulation of the copyright, you know, clear lawn, everything
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.840]   else from what it was originally designed to do, which was actually, you know, just
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.000]   protect guys who were putting something together that were small, that wanted to push this
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.840]   forward.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.960]   And I really think at some point in time the patent office is going to have to start tightening
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.600]   up and getting rid of these bottom feeders.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.320]   Well, the eBay case last year kind of started that trend.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.240]   The eBay patent that Supreme Court said, well, yeah, you guys had a patent, but we're going
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.920]   to let eBay use it anyway.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.480]   I think that sort of set a chilling effect down all these lawyers' spines and they're
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.280]   not going to be able to chase this ambulance.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.640]   A little common sense ruling.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.680]   What else is happening in the Apple world?
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   Am I missing?
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   I think there was a lot of stuff.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   We could do that.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   Who talks to bring lyrics to iTunes?
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   Yes.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   That's kind of a good news.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.200]   Apple's talking to Grace Note.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.840]   Grace Note, it's interesting.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.560]   Grace, I remember they bought CDDB, which wasn't lyrics.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.120]   It's just the tracks and artists and album name, but they have so much better all the
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   time.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.660]   Well, I was a little mad about it because it was kind of a public, it was like buying
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.660]   Wikipedia and turning it into a movie.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.660]   What do you use for RATHL?
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.580]   What do you use for retroactively going and let's say that you've got you've ripped stuff
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.180]   and you didn't have the information?
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:22.540]   Do you use brains or what do you use for applying metadata to untagged MP3s?
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.340]   I have an easy picture.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.340]   I use my fingers.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.020]   I use anything in years only because I buy everything now online.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.020]   Everything is tagged.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.020]   That's true.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.580]   I use a program called I eat brains.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.580]   Brain's great.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:34.580]   That's a great thing.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.580]   It works pretty well.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.740]   I had it didn't recognize some tracks from an Nirvana record yesterday, which I thought
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.740]   was kind of weird.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.740]   But it's one thing that's nice about that.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   Who can blame it?
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.740]   Wow.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.460]   You're from Washington.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.460]   He's a grunge.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.460]   I hate grunge music.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.460]   Oh, wait, wait a turn on your community, Scott.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.900]   I live in San Francisco now, dude.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   Okay.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.900]   We got a grunge here too.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.740]   You're a class act, Warren.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:03.860]   I'm just curious because so it's CDDB does, if I understand it, they have this huge,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.820]   ginormous database where people have been submitting tracks and they have acoustic footprints.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.820]   Is it the tracks that?
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   Is that how it works?
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.820]   Yeah, it's kind of primitive.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.580]   What they do essentially is they look at the number of tracks on the album and the length
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.900]   of the tracks and then they just figure out heuristically what album it is, which often
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.660]   you'll get two or three choices and you have to say, I know that's a acoustic footprint
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.660]   also.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.660]   Sting, not pericomo.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.300]   I don't know if they use an acoustic footprint.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   Well, they can't do CDDB.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.620]   They look for a diminumous level of suck in the track.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.340]   They're able to interpolate which period from his sucking track came from.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.460]   All I have to say is that.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.460]   That might be too scientific for you.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.780]   That's a little too fancy for me.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.060]   Now, when I talk to CDDB, it was actually pretty darn simple.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:50.180]   Maybe they're using a thumbprint or fingerprint now, but I don't think they were at the time.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.740]   Who knows what Grace Note is using?
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.740]   They've added, I think they've acquired these lyrics databases.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.740]   Apparently, Yahoo!
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:01.060]   Music is going to start doing legal license song lyrics.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.540]   Another reason to like the subscription model, be nice if Apple added this.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.980]   It's in the tag.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:16.380]   I think that's the one thing I really miss buying online is the liner notes, the album,
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.300]   the art, the lyrics, all of that stuff.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.460]   Man, I grew up listening.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.820]   You put the headphones on.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.060]   You'd have the lyrics in front of you.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.620]   You'd look at the album and while you listen to it.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.100]   This is something where conventions can kind of get in the way because that's totally possible.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.580]   I mean, there are some podcasts out there.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.500]   I'm thinking of the Casper Hauser Comedy Podcast where they have this great thing.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:40.180]   They do on iTunes where they put out bits, they put out like skits and stuff like that.
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.300]   But they also, they're the guys who do the Sky Mall catalog.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   They do the Sky Mall catalog.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   Very funny.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.300]   Very funny.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   But so like sometimes on iTunes, you'll suddenly see a little document icon in your iTunes
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.300]   feed.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.180]   It's like, oh, they just put a PDF into the feed.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.180]   So there's nothing to stop people from.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   We could do that.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   Yeah, you're running high quality.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.180]   You could do show notes.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.180]   You could do high quality art.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.180]   I might be talking to my bud.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.180]   I'm pretty sure you can do all this stuff.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.180]   I've definitely seen just another kind of a profile.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.180]   Just RSS too.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.340]   Maybe a PDF, which is, you know, it's not paper.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.340]   Yeah, but I mean, you control the layout.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.980]   It's not what you're going to do like a tech thing.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.060]   I mean, you know, that's a good way to like put out something that anybody can look at
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.220]   and it'll be high quality.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.300]   Did you hear their, this American life parody?
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.300]   Casper Hauser.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.780]   Oh, no, I haven't.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:20.780]   I haven't.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.780]   Oh my God.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.780]   You listen to this American life, don't you?
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   Oh, God.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.780]   Oh, wait, you hear it.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.780]   Wait, it's true from San Francisco.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:27.780]   I have to listen.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.780]   I might have to play a little bit of it.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.780]   Can I play a little bit of it?
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.780]   Heck up.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:39.260]   I'm sure they said that and who do they need to say or is there a family
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.840]   is their own residence is because it is
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.060]   all its own other units
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.860]   you gotta listen to this a goat, grant us a SPR Haro C.U.C.R.A.T.com
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:53.220]   , if you've ever listened to this American life you'll listen
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:48:13.980]   to this American life, you'll listen to this American life, you won't laugh, but if you
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:27.420]   have a question. Do you listen to that show a scup or I listen to a couple of them. I think it's well done. It's probably I would say the best example of modern radio production ever. I mean it's just brilliant. But but Casper
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:44.400]   Haro C.U.C.R.A.T.com
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.600]   Oh, who's a guy named Jesse Thorn, who does something called the sound of young America.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:55.860]   Oh, well, you know, I'm a fan of kind of effect that everyone's called Coil & Sharp come
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.820]   up on my iPod. It's just a great interlude between the music.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.860]   One of the classics was up last week. The drug drugstore, where they go in and Coil
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:09.300]   is gonna operate on sharp and they wanna get they in a station wagon outside the drugstore,
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   and so they'd go on in and get some material.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.700]   I just heard the one where they want to not once I get it. I can figure out.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:23.460]   I just heard the one where they have very bad German accents. A couple of German guys
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.360]   are out there watching a football game and they ask a guy if he can help them train Wolverines
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.060]   to play football.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.360]   Actually, Wolverines.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.300]   That is that is an excellent. Oh my God.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.500]   So there's more. So it's not just the CD. There's more coming out on the podcast all
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.060]   the time.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:44.300]   Oh yeah, what they're doing is Jennifer is working with Jesse to do that. This is so
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:48.320]   odd. This is the worst. This is a meta meta rat hole, but no, she's he's working with
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.540]   now Sharpe's daughter to put that stuff out.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.020]   Cool. Cool. Very cool.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:58.340]   Anyway, where were we? I am so completely lost track of what we were talking about.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.740]   Just finding lyrics. Following the dirigibles of my mind as they pass.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:08.500]   If loading by anything else in the Apple world before we get to picks.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.380]   I just bought a new iMac. So the new iMacs are coming out tomorrow.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.180]   I have a segue. I have a pseudo segue that can get us into picks. It's worth mentioning
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.140]   that a new handbrake just came out. Oh, it's out. Yes. The media fork.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:26.420]   And this is this is huge to me because it's got built in Apple TV support. It automatically
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.980]   and amor and amorfic a sizes stuff. It's got chapter markers and it's got presets.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.620]   So is this are you now?
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:39.380]   See, I used as an experiment. I downloaded these episode of second episode of the Sopranos
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:46.380]   and used the visual hub to make it Apple TV and it did a great job.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.820]   Worked fine. Would you say handbrake does a better job?
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.260]   Different different tool. This is if you have let's see if you've got a DVD of your child's
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.060]   birthday party. So it's for ripping. Yes. If you got a DVD of content that you own and
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:03.060]   you'd like to get that onto your Apple TV, you just point it. It's completely idiot-proof.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:08.060]   If you just point it at the drive and automatically it's kind of smart because it looks at the
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.860]   DVD and finds the longest track on there and understands that that's probably the thing
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.260]   that you want. And then you just say it picks all these settings. You can say I want this
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.660]   from my iPod. I want this from my PlayStation. I want this for whatever.
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.660]   You probably want this in addition to Mac the Ripper because I think Mac the Ripper can
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.380]   handle some copy protected discs at handbrake.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:31.540]   I would know about that. But the visual hub is really like has gotten so much better.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.780]   And if you like I do it. It was a fork. It was a handbrake fork which has now been folded
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.020]   back in. No, no, no. So visual hub is the ice squint.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:44.140]   Oh, I'm sorry. I was talking about media. Media. Yeah, I'm sorry. Media for me. Yeah,
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.140]   but yeah, but it's visual hub is is so visual hub is for stuff that's already on your hard
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.940]   drive. Visual hub is if you got any kind of we've talked about the sign before, but
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.100]   you've got a digital file in some kind of a video format and you needed to transcode
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.820]   it into another kind of video format. It's totally idiot because the Sopranos came in
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:04.660]   as a divx file, I think. I just hypothetically, if I had a copy, which of course I didn't.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.540]   And then I you so you could hypothetically grab a whole season's worth of hypothetical
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.780]   TV shows and drop them on there when you and it automatically adds it to iTunes and it
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:18.380]   showed up in its sync top on your eye on your eye. I had the medical Apple TV. It was amazing.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.740]   And when I had that they actually watched it, it actually was very good quality. Yeah,
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.540]   I hypothetically felt really bad for Bobby in that one episode. Oh, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.580]   I liked it on your tumble log. You posted the quote. The Parker Brothers put a lot of
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:37.580]   thought into this. I think we should respect that. You like that screenshot? That way.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:41.580]   It's great. Hypothetically. Where did you get that screenshot from your hypothetical
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:49.940]   Apple? I used a Canon digital rebel. Did you really? Shoot a no. You shot already into
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.580]   your neighbor's house. Anyway, what could it fix at all in post? And so that's my segue
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:59.940]   into a fix. Copy right place. I have a segue actually in the pick. Jack Booty, thugs.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:06.700]   Yeah, I put it back. So I'm going to repeat. I actually I have to repeat a pick this this
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.780]   this week. So it was so good that you were picking up a pick. I used it last night and
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:17.500]   it saved my my put took us so much that I need I need to mention it. It's a double pick.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:25.860]   I'm doing a double pick. Okay. The pick is carbon copy. Cloner. Very good. So I had
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.760]   super duper kind of super seated. I don't know. I hadn't I didn't use super duper last
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.420]   night. All I know is that I try to change my hard drive on my laptop and it's now in
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:41.100]   pieces and I'm really, really laptop. Yeah, it's okay. So so what happened was is that
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.880]   I didn't have enough time. I'm leaving out for Africa and I needed a bigger hard drive
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:49.600]   than the 100 gig one that I have in there. So I figured I'll just swap it out for a 160
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:55.320]   and and so you know swapping out a hard drive on a 160 on a Mac book is nothing swapping
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:01.200]   out a hard drive on a Mac book pro is basically disassembling, you know, the idea of the I
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.880]   book used to be like that too. And so as I as I started going into it as one of those
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.840]   things like you start you start doing it. You look at the instructions on fix it. You
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.600]   know, I want to do the instructions on fix it and and you know, it all looks fine. It
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.640]   all looks like it's all going to work out. And then you start going into it and suddenly
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.760]   you're you're really taking this thing apart and you're keeping track of the 80 different,
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:25.320]   but very, very small screws that you've now taken out of here out of your computer except
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   that I'm I took like, I don't know, I took eight extra screws out, but I took two, no,
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:37.080]   I took I was short to. So when I went to lift up the the what they call the upper case.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.040]   Now it says in the instructions that it may be hard to open so you might have to move
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:45.520]   it back and forth that hard, not that hard. So what happens when when when the two screws
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:50.600]   behind the the battery are still attached, when you do that, what you do is you end up
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.320]   separating the the spot welds that are holding you know, parts of the component away from
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:00.360]   the from the top face, you know, underneath. So you the little clicking sound that you're
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.640]   that you hear just in case anyone ever goes through this, a little clicking sound that
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.480]   you hear is not not the plastic sliding out that you think it's it's actually your career
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:13.920]   and it's the it's the little spot welds popping off. And then as you pull it just a little
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.240]   bit more and then you realize that it's happening, you go back, it's already too late because
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.120]   where those screws are in are now that metal has now been bent back and forth a couple
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:27.440]   of times and it's a, you know, cheers. So what you end up with is this fine looking laptop
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:32.600]   that you can't actually, you know, put back together. So I'm so you can't put it together
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.680]   at all. You know, I could I could put it back together, but it would be flop.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.240]   The problem is there'd be lots of space in there. So what I did is I there's this there's this
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.680]   place not too far away from our office called the Powerbook guy. I don't know if that's
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.280]   the company or the guy, but it's the Powerbook guy sent the Powerbook guy. I went to the Apple
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.440]   store of all things and I asked how much is the top cost and he goes, I know it's about
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.280]   300 bucks. But if you go to the power, this is the Apple, the Apple store to go to the
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.880]   Powerbook guy. I know I think this was great. He goes, it's really expensive here. But if
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.360]   you go to the pick, you go to the Powerbook guy, he'll do it for probably, you know, 150,
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:09.080]   300 bucks. I haven't done it yet. I instead panicked and because they didn't have any
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.680]   stock at the Apple store or the Powerbook guy. And so and I have to leave on Friday. So I
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.200]   now have a new Powerbook. So, so,
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:23.360]   our book or Mac book? A new Mac book pro. Excellent. Which is much faster than my last
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.720]   one. And so this one's going to go into the shop. But what was the reason that this came
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.160]   up with carbon copy cloner is because of course I had before I did any of this stuff, I had
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:37.360]   a perfect clone of my, of my computer. Smart man. And and when I, I mean, perfect, you
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:43.080]   know, and bootable, everything. And we all I had to do was simply, I ran it for, you
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:48.120]   know, I literally, I realized the computer was screwed at eight, bought a new computer
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:53.360]   at eight 30. And by 11 30 at night, it was like the same computer, but faster. I mean,
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.200]   it was cool. It was nothing. I mean, literally every, I mean, the history of my recent items
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.880]   was still there. I mean, it was a perfect copy of my, of my drive and all the operating
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.120]   system stuff and everything else. Now there's a couple of little things where there's a
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.520]   handful of my programs that are coded. Yeah, there's a handful of stuff like that. I think
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:16.920]   Skype was freaking out wrong before we started here. So he's freaking out for you, dude.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:22.320]   Alex, can I just bet that you're going to need to reauthorize snaps pro? I'm just going
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.920]   to go ahead. Oh, yeah, I got to get that no code. If I get a chest cold, I've got to
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.440]   go reauthorize. Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure that snaps pro is going to, I'm going to test
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.160]   it before I go. Although I have been using, I've been doing a lot more with the, I show
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:40.760]   you, um, application, get in the sketch beta. It's done when I'm done. It's the way you
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.360]   live. Skidges, Skidges is so amazing. Skidges. Oh my God. Get in the beta for sketch, contact
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.520]   Chris, a Atari boy and get in for sketch. Yeah. He's the guy who makes the comic life,
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:55.760]   I think it's a comic life program. And he's got a splash. Yeah, exactly. Pusk.com. And
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.280]   he has a, it's in for a wide beta right now. I think it's going to go wide in a couple
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.760]   of weeks and it's mind blowing. It's, it's such a great, so better than snap Z pro. It
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.720]   has, let me, let me give it to you this way. If you take a lot of screen captures and put
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.720]   it on flicker, you can have multiple accounts. You put in the FTP information for multiple
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:16.900]   accounts. You go in, you snap something, you click, you right click, it uploads it and
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.840]   then puts the clipboard into your, it puts the early into your clip. It does do, it does
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:27.840]   video as well. No, it does not. It does annotate it, does annotate it screenshots. So you can
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.400]   still use snap Z pro for the screen shots. Yeah, for I love I show you for video. That's
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:39.160]   what we've been using. I show you. I did. I did. I just finished three, three GMTs and
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.400]   inside the black box and I think, and then one from my own with all slideshows. So what
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:47.320]   I did is I, as I put them in Photoshop and I just drew over them talking on the whackam
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.960]   tablet, you know, like the Mac break, wrote a 10, and he pees. And so those will be coming
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   out over the next couple of weeks. But that was all with I show you. And what's great
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.400]   is you finish it and it's done. Like you do the whole thing and you hit style. There's
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:02.440]   that long save and snap Z pro. There's not, there's not, when you finish, I show you
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.960]   you when you finish the whole thing is just done. And then I move on to the next one.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:11.240]   You want to do if you can, you want to be using a pretty CPU, a pretty heavy CPU machine
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:14.960]   because it's relying heavily on CPU, but it lets you, that is the issue. It does. But
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.440]   the thing, the cool part is even their presets let you go in and say I'm willing to have
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:22.800]   a trade off of CPU versus quality or quality versus CPU. And you pick what works for you
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.960]   and it's, and it works great.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   And when I do Photoshop stuff and, and, and smaller stuff, I show you seems to work really,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.200]   really well where I have trouble is if I'm using shake or, or a big 3D application or,
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.400]   or sometimes some of the Final Cut Pro stuff. That's when things start to really bonk down.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.640]   Shiny white box.com. Yes. I show you.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.840]   Our book guy is at powerbookguy.com. And this looks really cool. He's got a bunch of like
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:52.600]   used like refurbished. He's got, and he can get a 12 inch iBook for 250 bucks. What?
[00:59:52.600 --> 01:00:00.080]   Yeah. I don't know. Well, iBook. Oh, iBook. You want the power book. Yeah, but still that's
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:06.960]   pretty if it's, so this is a 500 megahertz 128. I'm really mad. I, you know, text expanders
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:14.080]   shipped out HTML entity abbreviations. And one of them is dot.com. Every time I type
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:22.080]   dot com now in my browser, it does it replaces it with the entity for copyright. Try me crazy.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.000]   Okay, sorry. Continue on with power book guy. Now I can go to him. I don't know somehow
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   I managed to change it. I'm taking that one out. How could they put that in there? 300
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.360]   megahertz clamshell blueberry. I book $169. That's got your name written all over it.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:42.600]   Oh, hello, ladies. Give that to give that to Madeline. Blueberry clamshell. You could
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.800]   use that for an episode of that phone guy. I could it and it looks like an Aqua toilet
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.080]   seat, which is low. 169 bucks. You give that to a kid. That's pretty good. Yeah, actually
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   that be a good kid. Computer, wouldn't it? This is pretty good. I could have sold him
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.640]   my cube. Oh, he only does laptops. And he's, he's just up on. He's still trying to get
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.280]   rid of that cube. Are you? Yeah. No, I actually gave it to charity. Let them let them deal
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:14.560]   with it. Let the poor kids use it. Yeah. Yeah. You said, yeah. So your pick is Alex Lindsey
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.840]   is a carbon copy. I do want to, you know, super duper is kind of superseded that. Well,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.720]   I'll also take a look at super duper is super duper is neat because you can just flip it
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.520]   on and run it. And it's great. But if you dig just the tiniest bit under the hood, there's
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.680]   a huge amount of flexibility where you can go in and say, okay, so make sure you skip
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.880]   over caches, skip over this, skip over iTunes, skip over my movies one. So you can actually
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.000]   come up with a pretty nice incremental backup where like maybe once a month you do a full
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.680]   image of your drive and then like every day you could do a snapshot that takes no time
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.480]   at all to run that skips all your really huge stuff and just incremental changes.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.000]   And it's free for the basic functionality, which is kind of, I mean, carbon copy closes
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.480]   is absolutely free. I don't think he's done a universal version of it yet. Has he?
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.400]   But the nice thing that they both have a universal universal. I didn't know it was
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.720]   universal. I didn't know it was universal. I did. But they both make bootable drives,
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.800]   which is the key. I mean, it's crazy to sit here and split hairs. They're both fantastic.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.680]   But the main thing that's critical about those over any other kind of app is that these make
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.880]   bootable, you know, drive. So they're images, they're image copies, identical bit images.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.360]   Yeah. And it's a lot different than just moving your files over somewhere. Having that
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.600]   in an image of your drive that you can simply reinstall, it was just amazing. I mean, three
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.720]   hours after it was exactly like nothing had happened. And it was just that was awesome.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.560]   I guess my I guess my sense of super doopers more up to date, it's universal carbon copy
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   cloner is not yet. I've used copy copy, copy cloner for years and it's free. And frankly,
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.680]   it doesn't really matter that it's not universal does it? I mean, you know, you're gonna use
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.320]   it every day. Yeah, right. Good pick, I think. But super doodler is a good one.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:57.040]   Take a look at Scott, born your pick. My pick is a piece of hardware this week. And it's
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.960]   one seventh of an Alex. That's a hundred bucks, hundred bucks. It's called the M audio
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:10.080]   key station, 49. It's a little keyboard you plug in your USB port and let me tell you,
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.640]   if you got garage band and you do, if you got a Mac and probably got a Mac, because you're
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:21.960]   listening to this show, this gives you like a mad super super cool synthesizer. 49 keys.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.360]   So it's almost half a full keyboard and it's cheap. It's very cheap and it has cool features
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:33.200]   like pitch bend modulation wheels. It's completely powered off the USB bus has a built in USB
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.880]   MIDI interface. So if you're one of those kind of people that wants to hook up to really
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.640]   sophisticated software, you can do MIDI stuff. I got it and I hooked it up to garage band
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.720]   and just started playing around with the garage band samples that come with garage band and
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.520]   thought, wow, this is really cool. I happen to have purchased all of the samples that
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:56.720]   Apple sells. And when I got into the deep stuff, I was thinking, man, this sounds as
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.600]   good as some of the expensive keyboards you can buy a place like Guitar Center.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:08.520]   129 bucks. And you can buy retail about 100. Wow. So this is the best inexpensive USB
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.000]   keyboard for the Mac. Oh, I tried several and this one really is quite good. It comes
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.320]   with some additional software. If you're one of those people that knows how to do MIDI
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.800]   stuff and you really want to go nuts, able to live. For 100 bucks, you can hardly have
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:28.240]   so much fun. That's great. That's great. My pick as I promised you at the beginning,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.360]   sailing clicker from sailing.com. I'm surprised you haven't tried this. It's a very cool program.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.160]   It doesn't work with sprint phones. I don't. You need to have a really good phone. Yeah,
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.520]   like an adult Bluetooth relationship. And then maybe that's why the child like hobbled
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.600]   Bluetooth. Maybe the problem. Well, it doesn't work with my Nokia 93. It won't work with
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   the 95, although I think they have a new version coming out to support the new Symbian.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.120]   The Sony Eric sense. It works great with those. Oh, you've played with it. Then you
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.280]   know what it is. The same people use it. Yeah, it's fantastic. It's a great, great piece.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:02.840]   So the idea is you put it on this phone. You put it on your on your Mac or your PC. And
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.480]   what happens when you come into the room is it's your your Mac sees you're there because
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.240]   it's got a Bluetooth relationship and you can program it to do a variety of things. For
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.360]   instance, when you leave the room, you can have it pause iTunes. When the phone rings,
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:20.400]   you can have it mute iTunes. I've used it as a keynote or PowerPoint clicker. Can't you
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.580]   use it also for color ID? You know, the color ID pop up. It's so great. You get the big
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.640]   one. Somebody calls you get the big letters on the key on the screen saying who's calling.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:35.200]   So a lot of nice features and completely programmable. So it gives you a lot of, you know, additional
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.320]   stuff you can do pretty much anything you, you know, might think of you could do. And
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.960]   it works very well with a Mac. I've used it for a long time. I'm kind of disappointed
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.240]   because it doesn't work with my current phone, but they promise an update for Symbian. So
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:55.840]   I'm looking forward to that. That's my suggestion. And that's why I'm sticking with and I it's
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:05.840]   not free. It's $23.95, but you could try it free at sailing.com. Sailing software. And
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.400]   I guess at least but one and that would be you, Mr. Merlin Segway man. This has been
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:16.880]   a really good week for software. I have there's I actually have three. I only do one, but I've
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.600]   got. Oh, come on. Give us all three. Don't hold on. Well, I don't like to go nuts. Okay,
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.800]   quickly. I just discovered an open source program. It's been around for a while, but
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.320]   is new to me, which is called unison. And unison is if you're familiar with something
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.120]   like our sink or Corona sink or any of those where the idea is you've got two folders,
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.200]   a remote, a local one. And those apps are great. Our sink is great. And use. Well, yeah,
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.160]   it's and they tend to work on the model of which one of these is updated right for most
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.680]   recently. unison works a little differently. It unison, it's a little bit of pain to set
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.840]   up. It's kind of like it's very bash like in terms of using profiles and stuff like
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:55.360]   that. But once you have it set up, you can point it at two places and you actually enter
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.080]   things like the command line one liner that you want to use for handling diffs and it'll
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.160]   actually go in and do diffs on text documents. So even things like your preferences, if you're
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.460]   if you're like me and you're walking between two computers all day, you can have a cron
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:12.160]   job that basically runs this thing in such a way that you if you feel like you're always
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.560]   on the same computer, it'll auto. So after one like any of these things, after one big
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.800]   sink, it then just kind of runs and it'll record any changes and differences all and
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.280]   you just you never have to worry about it. It's it's really, really cool. And it can work
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.400]   on multiple machines using a server. Oh, no, even it works on everything. It's a command
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.840]   line app that has gooies and all the different versions. And you just go in and say unison
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.440]   and the name of my profile and it just runs.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.640]   Neato. So if you've ever been one of those people who's like, you know, kind of struggled
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.440]   with how you're going to put all that stuff together, definitely check it out.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.720]   Would this work to say, combine my iTunes libraries? So I don't keep buying songs. My
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.440]   daughter's already bought. That's a really good one. I think something like Chronosync
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:57.280]   would be better for that. I still use and love Chronosync. Chronosync is just a really,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.720]   really great way to handle stuff like what you're describing where you can go in and
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.560]   actually say the differences I want you to be concerned with are which one creation dates,
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.680]   modification dates, file size and so on. So I have I have one that automatically every
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.360]   night backs up my iTunes library and overwrites anything where my version is newer or larger.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.200]   Okay. And so it never steps on anything old. Right. Right.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.240]   I wish there was a really easy one click application for intelligently killing all duplicates,
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.840]   but I don't know. There's something called iDupE, which a lot of people like a lot.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:33.080]   Really? Yeah. I would take a look at and I believe it's free and it's designed for iTunes
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.880]   specifically. I will totally check that out. I do. So if you want to find this is a stupid
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.200]   long or also if you search for unison file synchronizer on the Google, you'll find this.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.040]   It's very cool. It's a little bit geeky, but this is a problem that's kind of geeky. So
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:51.880]   I love that very quickly. Number two, one of my all time favorite companies, Panek,
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.720]   came out this week with something called CODA, which is a very ambitious web development
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.240]   application. What I would call a kind of a prosumer web development application. It's not a full
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.080]   on iD.E. You're not going to build anything in rails inside of it. But if you need to do stuff
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:11.320]   with HTML, this is a one window application. You get this at panic.com/coda. Very modestly priced
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:16.200]   for what you get. It's just simply beautiful. All of these panning things, it's like a big bowl of
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.800]   rainbow sherbet. It looks gorgeous. It's very easy to use. It has a lot of power built in SSH shell.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:28.280]   Very cool app. If you're somebody who does HTML, but maybe not a lot of actual building
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   anything besides basic PHP, this is really something to look at. So it's not Dreamweaver?
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.960]   No, it's not. It doesn't. The thing is what it does, it's how can I put this? It's not trying
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.960]   to psych you out and be a wizzy wig. But you can do stuff, for example, like say, "Okay, I want to
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:47.240]   look at my code in this window." And then in the same window, I also want to see a preview,
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.240]   and I want to see a shell next to that. So if you've got a big ass screen, this is this app
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.680]   you can do everything all in this one ginormous, kind of multi-pane window.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.560]   Now these guys do transmit. Does it integrate with transmit?
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.280]   Well, when you open it up the very first time, the first thing that asks you is, do you want to
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   import all of your transport or all of your transmit? Oh, I'm buying this. How much is it?
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.960]   It's 100 bucks retail. It's 70 bucks. I bought it. I bought it the first hour it was out,
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.200]   because I'm a total fanboy of Panic. But it's really neat though. If you're a Windows, or excuse
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:21.960]   me, if you're a Mac person who is doing some web stuff, but you're just sick of dealing with,
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.760]   like, you know, I would never give up text. To me, that's the Power User app or BB Edit.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.240]   But if you want a really nice, like, easy to use HTML application, it's great.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.040]   Finally, last one. I can't believe you're indulging me in this.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.800]   No, this is the Berlin show. You make me so happy when I get to talk about it.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:47.560]   Everybody loves these, man. We all miss on OS 8 and 9. We all miss the Apple location manager,
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.120]   which is to make it... Yes. Yes. Remember that? Yes.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.680]   I am at work. So use this IP address and these sound settings and so on and so on and so on.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.200]   Yes. This is not perfect, but it's pretty good. It's called Marco Polo,
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.160]   and it's an open source location manager. What's it called? It's called Marco Polo.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:11.800]   Polo? What's it called? Polo. I need my glasses. And what it does is it's a little, it's an
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.880]   intelligent little location manager that looks at indications that you give it, and then it
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.120]   changes your settings based on how confident it is that your someplace different. So you say,
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.720]   if I can be given this IP address, I have a high level confidence that I'm at home.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.040]   And if I can see this IP... Oh, that's interesting.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.520]   I have a low level of confidence that I may be here and so on. And so basically it has two kind
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.160]   of layers to it. The first layer is it uses things that it can gather about your environment to say
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.520]   where things you are. And then second, it can apply rules based upon that. It's kind of geeky,
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.520]   but if you're somebody who's always traveling around and you go to the same five places over
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.840]   and over and get sick of changing your default printer, this is something you might want to look
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:12:01.800]   at. Mark Apollo. I got that via, I believe, Ultimate Apple WebLog. And it's a great little app.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.920]   Well, I'm so sorry. I gave you three different pieces of software.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:09.560]   That's good. This has been a software rich show and that's fine. I think that's a good thing.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.960]   Embric. Embric. Embric. No more media for it.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:18.120]   Not that you'd ever use that for illegal nefarious purposes.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.200]   I won't even know how to. No, me neither. I've disabled. I've got two optical drives on the
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.720]   one. Look at this. Coda does a little thumbnail of your site. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's pretty.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.440]   No, tell me. Tell me that isn't the prettiest. With little pieces of tape on it.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.160]   Beautiful diaphanus. You can go in and you can change. You can actually change that thumbnail,
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.920]   too, as to a different photo. Oh, I do like this. Oh, so this would be good for editing CSS files.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.600]   Well, do you have it open right now? Yeah. I don't have it open in front of me, but go to,
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.760]   like, split preview or split pane or split window or something like that. And it's cool,
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.280]   because you can Azure Azure developing and you'll see the changes updated automatically in the
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:59.240]   window next to it. Neetho. And it has tabs. So one of the things I still do a lot of by hand is
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.200]   modifying CSS for various sites. Well, yeah. And here's the thing. If you're like me and you're
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.880]   always going cowboy where you go straight onto the server and you open it and transmit.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.320]   I open it and I open it and I open it and I do that. You can now, if you want, if you want to be
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.080]   really cool, you can download all your stuff and kind of sync it. And then, but then when you need
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.640]   to go in and be a cowboy, you can go on the server and edit it live right inside this GUI.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.440]   Yeah, this looks like the way to do it. Very cool. Well, I would expect something this good from
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.520]   panic because they really know what they're doing. They're gifted. Guys, we're out of time.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.000]   Not really, but I'm going to pretend we're out of time. We're, we're out of tape. We actually,
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.840]   we've just ran out of all the tape is Scott, can you send me a pancake quick? Yeah, I got my
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:45.400]   tape splicer too. You know, I, I was just at SFO and they have a, I think it's mostly set up by
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:51.160]   Dolby because everything's on loan from Dolby in the United Concourse Gate 76 through 79 and
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.480]   audio history exhibit. You've got, if you haven't seen it, you've got to go see it. Yeah, I read about
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.240]   the paper. It made me want to fly somewhere just so I could go look at it. It's worth it. Yeah,
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.360]   because you have to get it's inside securities. You actually have to fly somewhere to see it.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:08.040]   But among other things, they have, they have an old Ampex recorder with a,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:13.640]   actually it's one of the original ones with, with the pancake on it. Oh my gosh. And, and it reminded
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.840]   me we used to buy tape without the, you didn't, wouldn't have the covers on it. You'd buy it in a
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.880]   pancake and you'd reel it off on a reel. And then they had a wire recorder of all things.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.400]   We used before our time. Yeah. Well, no, we used to do Mac break weekly on a wire recorder.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.360]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Many years ago, he probably don't remember that, but
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:37.720]   there weren't any Macs. That was back before the war. You couldn't get good wire. You had to make
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:41.880]   your own wire. That's a ring. And a cheap wire made out of wood.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.800]   It was children to exclude it for us. All right.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.880]   Hey, yeah, we're out of time. It is great to talk to all of you. We're glad to be back.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.680]   And we hope you come back next week for another lovely edition of Mac break weekly. Have a great
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.240]   Mac week. What? I one thing to say. What? Yes. I one thing to say.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.720]   Talk about a little bit on Twitch, but I want to make sure that all the code, the coupon code,
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:10.840]   the code P X C 50. We're giving we're letting people join the PIXA core for $50 for the whole
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:17.400]   summer. It's normally like $200. And there is a ton of challenges and training and like over
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:23.400]   80 hours of training over 40,000, 40,000, $50,000 of software that you get access to. There is,
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.920]   you know, just it's really going to be a great summer. So if you're looking for what you're
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.720]   going to do over the summer and you want to learn some graphics, even if you're if you just want
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.760]   to play with big toys, even if you're not doing this as a profession, this is the time to figure
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.800]   it out. So and to play with it. And so you can go to PIX score.com and and check it out. We're
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.280]   pretty excited to have everybody. And it's already starting to shape up to be a really,
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.880]   really fun, fun time. So anyway, check that out. It's a good deal.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.800]   And 50 bucks for a whole summer. That's fantastic. Yeah, I'll keep you busy.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:57.800]   You should put your kids into it. Oh, that's a great idea. So that's a great idea. I maybe I will.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.640]   There you go. All right. Now it's time to say goodbye. See you all then. Bye bye. Adios.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.320]   Marco. Hold up.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:26.520]   All right. So I asked people on my Twitter list to give me a list of words to use in this show,
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:32.680]   to try and work in. And did you? Yes. For a gourd. Wait a minute. You bastard. You had
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:39.240]   a hidden agenda. For gourd, I got Taint, for Joel Johnson, from The Throner. I got Servile,
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:45.320]   Vosiferous, for Never Morgan, for Jason Shell and I worked in Derigible, Ramora.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:49.640]   I was wondering where Derigible and Ramora came from. I regretted I could not get
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.920]   come quad for Ev or homophonous for Dan Morin of Macuser. Oh, you weren't trying if you didn't
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:59.720]   get him off of this. I was trying. I got to have come quad. Got Simpson. I got Diaphanis and
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:07.640]   Sherbet, Jason Shell and Derigible, Jeffine Knucklehead. How fun. Pretty good. What a good game that is.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.560]   I didn't get I didn't get come quad in for Ev. So I may have to carry that over to next week.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:29.640]   Now I feel bad I'm not on Twitter anymore.
