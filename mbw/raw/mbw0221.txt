[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.280]   to talk about.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.520]   It's starting with my good friend Alex Lindsey from the Pixel
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240]   Core, Pixel Core.com for that great guild of multimedia
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.320]   artists who work and learn together to create fine things.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.920]   We create pretty pictures.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.720]   Pretty pictures.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.040]   That's a cool.tv for the podcast.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.680]   Also here, he asked to be here, Mr. Merlin,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.240]   man, ladies and gentlemen, for you look nice today and 43
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.400]   folders.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.120]   And he's here for a very important reason, which
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.480]   we'll reveal in a moment.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.320]   Also here.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.040]   Hello.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.080]   Also here.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.640]   He's grumpy.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   He's gruff.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.600]   He's the Andy Rooney of this show, Mr. Andy Inaco,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.000]   the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.720]   Actually, I have selected for this show
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.080]   the Edward R. Murrow shot.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   Where's your cigarette?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.080]   Well, Zach, unfortunately I don't smoke.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.480]   Well, fortunately, but for the purposes of glamor,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.960]   I don't smoke, unfortunately.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.360]   But you notice that I seem more dynamic because the viewer
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.960]   thinks, oh my god, I'm intruding on this incredibly important
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.440]   conversation that Andy is having with somebody else over there.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.840]   In that case, I should go to the two shut.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.600]   Now, now you can see he's actually looking at Merlin's butt.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.200]   Merlin.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.240]   Merlin's like, oh, here we are.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.440]   A rooftop in London.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.360]   A subpress.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.280]   Is Paris burning?
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.240]   So this is London.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   We are here to celebrate.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.880]   Finally, I looked it up two years and six months after
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.560]   Merlin man predicted the yellow submarine iPod.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.440]   The release of the Beatles on digital with the inevitability
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.280]   and the speed of plate tectonic.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.600]   The rumor has proven to be.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.040]   It's funny because Apple did this yesterday.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.320]   They put up something on their page that said it was a
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.720]   beetle quote, but I think a lot of people didn't pick up on it
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.480]   that it was a beetle quote.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   Well, which one are you talking about?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.000]   Because it wasn't a beetle quote.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.280]   It was a quote from one of the Beatles in his first solo number.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.840]   I've already seen it.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.000]   I've already seen this line that I cited so much.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.040]   Like that's not a beetle song.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.480]   It's a McCarty song.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.360]   That's right.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   But wait, he recorded it during the Let It Be session.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.280]   That's true.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.160]   Yeah, it was a release.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.400]   It was like the first single.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.560]   I don't care.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.200]   I don't.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.080]   I promise you.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.720]   I don't.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.440]   I'll sign something to the effect that I don't care about this son.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.440]   So what was the line?
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.360]   It was tomorrow, never knows.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.760]   Tomorrow, never knows.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   What was it?
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.600]   I've already started purging things for my memory.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.280]   I know I'm trying to find this.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.640]   There was such an Olympic scale disappointment.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.440]   Was it really?
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.720]   I mean, they took over the whole front page of Apple.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.800]   It was pretty obvious to me that it was the Beatles.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.840]   And you know, Steve Jobs and how hard he's been trying to get the Beatles on.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.680]   And of course, the rancor between Apple Core and Apple Computers.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   I think in the land of--
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   This is the gift that you can give someone with everybody.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.200]   You know, Apple has everything else.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.360]   And what they wanted was the beat.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.520]   In the land of Cupertino, this is a huge announcement.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.960]   The rest of the world is like, what?
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.360]   Well, I think the problem is that the Beatles were great.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.440]   But I think most people who thought the Beatles were great already have it in their MP3 library.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.280]   I mean, they either rip their CDs or they found it on the internet or they--
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.680]   You know, I mean, it just seems like--
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.200]   I mean, and my parents will buy it on iTunes.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   But I--
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.960]   I don't think it's for your parents.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.880]   Go ahead, Annie.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.160]   Well, this is-- yeah, I mean, this is the point that I was making.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.200]   There are two things going on here.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.440]   Up until yesterday, I would have said
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.920]   that if there's going to be any one band that will never release their CDs on iTunes,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.160]   it would be the Beatles because people don't necessarily want to buy just one track off
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.200]   of "Sarjur Pepper."
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.160]   They can definitely, quote, force people to buy the entire CD and have no problems with that.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.000]   But then the later thing that makes more sense is that just because--
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.800]   When I grew up, when I got-- when I was starting to formulate my own musical taste,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   the Beatles were already 20 years old.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.760]   And now the current generation of young adults, now it's four decades old,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.800]   some of this music.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.920]   And so a lot of the fight is just--
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.800]   among the Beatles is just to try to make sure that their music is still relevant
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.120]   and still available.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.440]   There was a really bad--
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.040]   sort of influenced by-- there was a really, really bad John Lennon commercial
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.840]   for some car in Europe that has really badly overdubbed, like, interview footage of him.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.640]   And like, it's like almost like an American was overdubbed.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.360]   Oh, the thing is, we shouldn't be too connected to the past.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760]   That's not something new.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.400]   And you could tell it was like matched up.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.800]   And there was a lot-- and they dug up the actual interview footage in which he says nothing of the sort.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.400]   And so as always, Yoko got in the neck for that.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.440]   But they made the-- they're making the statement that, look, I know that sometimes this might be--
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.840]   this might be a kind of a jar, but we have to make sure that, you know,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.240]   John Lennon stays in the public eye that he's still like a familiar face and a familiar voice.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.440]   That's a valuable property.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.960]   Let's, you know, I mean, let's not forget that this is all about making money.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.120]   Right.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.720]   Well, also, I mean, all the Beatles have money.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.520]   I think they're more concerned to make sure that part of the Beatles catalog remains part of the world soundtrack,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.320]   which is what it is.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.200]   I mean, I'm sure that everybody in this conversation right now--
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.080]   It's not just the Beatles.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   It's EDMI, which has been struggling.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.520]   EMI is the one that needs to make the money right now.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.560]   Yeah, it seems like they had-- this is a long throw into the long and winding road.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.480]   Oh, yeah, into the end zone.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.160]   I think it's all-- when I say entirely symbolic, I don't mean that in a negative way.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.840]   I think in a really fascinating way, it's really symbolic.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   I think most of what everybody just said is kind of half right.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.200]   The part of the Beatles, yeah, they got the money.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.080]   Yeah, they want their legacy out there.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.360]   But it's like the two most popular kids in high school like getting engaged.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.320]   This is-- I mean, the thing is for the Beatles-- when I say the Beatles, I mean the Beatles as kind of an institution.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.120]   I mean, what happens?
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.080]   The richest rich guy in the world is still giving money to colleges so that they'll build buildings with his name on it.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.000]   Like, what more could you achieve, right?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.520]   With the Beatles, I think it's something where, yeah, being on the homepage of the Apple thing is every--
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.560]   I'm sure every single aspect of this was negotiated to the end degree for every bit of the wording.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.520]   I'm guessing.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.960]   But from the Beatles standpoint, now they don't need the dough.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.480]   Probably.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.640]   I mean, we say the Beatles.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.840]   I mean, you know, it's Olivia and Yoko and everybody.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.960]   Ringo may be more than the rest, though, must be honest.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.160]   Ringo thinks the song-- Ringo thinks the song-- Ringo had so few songwriting credits, and that's where the dough is.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.320]   Yes, it's getting much money yesterday.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.440]   But for a Beatles standpoint, I don't have much of an opinion on the Beatles.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   I think with the Beatles, it burnishes their image, right?
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   And they keep putting out the, you know, those box set and stuff like that.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.920]   But from Apple's point of view--
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.800]   What?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.760]   They're already the frickin' Beatles, man.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   I was-- What kind of image you're furnishing--
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   Well, but think about what you just said, Andy.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.000]   I'm just straight to your point.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.320]   They burnishes it for the kids.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.680]   I don't think of the kids.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.960]   It's not so much nourishing their image.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.880]   It's not the association with Apple.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.040]   It's the fact that they need to have their music available through the retail channels that the current generation is using.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   I think that's--
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   I think that's--
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.360]   They decided to make a version of Rock Band for the Beatles.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   Some people might have thought that was tacky a few years ago, but that's how new generations get exposed to music nowadays.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.880]   Right.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.120]   I honestly think that is just one part of it.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.040]   I think the other part of it is that this is an alliance that makes both sides look better.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.400]   And for the Beatles, I mean, the one I'm trying to say is the sales are there for the Beatles.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.120]   They have evergreen content that's always gonna sell.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.920]   But to your point, like you said, yeah, whatever it was, 40 years old, few years ago, so on.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   But from Apple's point of view, yeah, maybe it's Steve Jobs like the Beatles, but I don't know if this number's up to date, but there's this statistic out that Apple's like the biggest music retailer now.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   90% of all digital sales are through Apple, but the majority of the large--
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   They're also the largest retailer.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   They're the largest retailer.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   But most records are--
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.320]   Most music is still on CD, almost--
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320]   Oh, I think it's three quarters.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.920]   Well, I'm the last figure I saw was something like 82%.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   But it's dropping on a rock.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   Well, I can finish the thought.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   The all I'm trying to say is that the trend line, it's like when you do a stock--
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   We want you to stock trend lines.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   You know, if you do growth on Microsoft versus Apple from 1986 on, it tells one story.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   If you do growth on Apple from 2001 on, or however you want to start measuring, it tells a slightly different story.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   And in this case, I think it's not just about those numbers.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   I think it's precisely about the Venn diagram that describes both of these worlds, right?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   So, yeah, the Beatles are getting out there.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   But what Apple's really doing is saying, "Hey, we have arrived.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   We just got something.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   I just reread 1984."
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.920]   And there's that whole part at the end where O'Brien is saying to Winston Smith,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   "This is power for power's sake.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   Hold on just a second.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   Tri-caster crashed."
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.920]   So, you were making a point, Merlin Mann, before we got rudely interrupted.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   Do you have any idea what that point was?
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   Oh, it's a small fact.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.920]   I don't have much to back this up.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   But I think the trend line is-- this sounds so obvious until you square it against what everybody's saying about this.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   The trend line is clearly the digital-- let me put it this way-- downloads are where it's going.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   Making money from downloads is even better.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   And the trend line for downloads is clearly in Apple's favor right now.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   And to Andy's point about this being old music, which I agree with,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   I mean, people who want the Beatles know where to get the Beatles.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   It's not hard.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   It's more a question that Apple is establishing themselves as exactly what they are,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   which is the big player right now.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.920]   And I think by doing this and promoting it in the way that they are,
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.920]   they're-- what I was saying, when I was saying-- I was just rereading 1984,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   and there's this scene where O'Brien is torturing Winston Smith,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   and there's this whole long part where he's just saying, "The reason for power is power.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   The reason for torture is torture."
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   And I was thinking, "I couldn't get that out of my head because I think this is just a bold brazen
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   power move.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   It's great.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   They'll sell some records.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   They'll probably continue to break even or lose money like they have.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   But they're swinging a lot of lumber right now to say, "We got something nobody else can get."
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   You'll notice it wasn't AC/DC or Bob Seger that they got.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   It wasn't those holdouts.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920]   It was the Beatles.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   And nobody else got that.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   And if AC/DC and Bob Seger thought that they were going to get something out of holding out like they were going to be--
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   It's a little late for that.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   Yeah, it's over now.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   So much it will, but they're evergreen.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   I mean, they continue to sell records, those guys.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.920]   And that's the kind of whatever long tail, whatever you want to call it that these companies kill for.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   I mean, how many people are going to be buying a hoe-down throw-down five years from now?
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   But people are going to continue to buy--
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   But Lenin 2010, appropriately named, points out that you can get on iTunes.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   Beatles Revolver is $12.99.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   You can buy it on CD for $7.99.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.920]   And that's higher quality.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   I mean, my only point is not that this music is dying out, but only that they had a really good revenue stream via CD.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.920]   I don't feel as though they had an absolute need to move to digital.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   This is definitely a good way to make sure that you're putting in front of the young folks who may not necessarily be in.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   But also, it's also the reason why NBC was so eager to make sure that they keep J. Leno, even if it's in the 10 PM slot.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   It was valuable to Apple to get the Beatles.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   It's prestigious for Apple.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   Good attention getting for Apple.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   But also, it's just as important.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   They make sure that Amazon does not get the Beatles first.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.920]   Because that will be a huge disaster.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.920]   And I think that for Apple, $20 million of advertising and probably whatever else they're doing, and we don't know that.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   I'm just making that number up.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   At least that $20 million or $30 million of advertising is noise for Apple.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   But EMI needs to punch right now.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   They need that cash in cap.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   And a little while ago, we heard that, you know, Paul McCartney said it's all up to EMI at this point.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   You know, Beatles are out of it.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   And EMI now needs as much cash as they can get.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   So getting Apple to spend $20 million to give them $20 million to $30 million is not as...
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   If you love the Beatles and have not yet bought the box set, it's $149 on iTunes.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   It's $129 on Amazon, buying on Amazon and rip it.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   You know, Amazon dropped their price on that box set.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   I do notice that.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   I don't know.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   I hear everybody saying contradictory things though.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   And the one, if you're going back and forth between, oh, people are still mostly CDs versus dah-da-da-da.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   Well, you know, when...
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   For Apple to announce, hey, guess what?
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   You can buy OK Computer.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   Well, Uncle Joe is going to hear that and go, OK, what Computer, what?
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   But you go, oh, they've got the Beatles.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   And suddenly, maybe a bunch of people who have an iPod and haven't bought it, stuff in the past,
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   we're going to go back to the store.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   And what does that do?
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   That gets them back in the habit of thinking of iTunes, again, as they're home for this stuff.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   I don't think it's not about money.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   Obviously, it's about money on some level.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   But like the iTunes store itself, it's not about the obvious money.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   It's about a much bigger play.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   Apple is establishing themselves as this company that's much bigger than Walmart in terms of like,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   we want to move units.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   They wanted to move those units.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Right.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   And nobody else got to.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   And this also have anything to do with the Apple Core versus Apple issue.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   I mean, is this also a way of bearing the hatchet on that?
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Or is that...
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   I don't think that was a major issue at all.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   Not at this point.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   Not at this point.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   Not at this point.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   I don't know.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   I'm sure.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   What does Apple Core have besides that?
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   It's like bad finger?
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.920]   Like what would it have been?
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   They do have bad finger, yes.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   I love bad fingers.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   No, you're right.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   No, I mean like they're really the most underrated band of all time.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.920]   But like what else does Apple Core got that's like bearing needle right now, you know?
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   Well, nothing.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   But the point is that I remember Apple sued Apple Core.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   sued Apple saying you said you'd never get in the music business.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   And here you are in the music business.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   And that lawsuit, I sure got settled with some big chunk of change.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   But I think in a way also that's will be seen maybe not, you know, with any reality as kind
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   of the end of that chapter as well.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920]   This is a little random.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   Apple, Apple owns Apple entirely.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:49.440]   You can see Clay Shorkey's article on his latest article about the failure of the paywall at
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   Fox News.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.920]   So basically, well, it was, you know, like everything Clay, he just sweat smart.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   He's such a smart guy.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   It was such a great piece on basically the fact that, I don't know the exact details, but
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.880]   Rupert Murdoch, you know, the news court decided to put their two biggest English papers
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.360]   behind a paywall.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.000]   And Clay runs some of the math on that of what it means to them in the long run.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.960]   They made, he ran several different ways to figure out how much they made slash lost
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   from that.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.240]   And it's kind of staggering.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.760]   And the upshot of what he says is that this is exactly the same thing that's happened.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.840]   There's nothing new about this failure.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.600]   What's new about it is it's starting to really feel like people are going, this is my words,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   not his.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.080]   You know, it's really not going to be 1972 again.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.000]   And we need to start dipping our toes a little bit deeper into this water if we want to stay
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   alive.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.280]   I mean, the numbers it used to be, it all seemed like funny money.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.080]   But I think now this is, again, I don't think this is really about the Beatles.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   I think this is about where this stuff is heading.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.360]   And so anyway, I just think it's an interesting orthogonal angle to this because these big
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.520]   companies are finally, I think they're running out of dough.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.440]   I think they thought that they could litigate this long enough that people would just decide
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.720]   to buy CDs forever.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.120]   But that trend line is not strong right now.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.320]   Well, it's not strong anywhere either.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.720]   I mean, you look at the cable companies trying to, you know, keep track of the, you know,
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   they're trying to keep it from becoming dumb.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.960]   Can I point out that EMI worked this perfectly?
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   They last was a year ago.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.120]   They came out with a box set.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.520]   They've milked every penny out of the CD buyers.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   They could.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.800]   And then they said, okay, now Apple's going to give us some nice advertising and maybe
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.040]   we'll get the kids.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.640]   You've never been able to buy many of the Beatles songs as singles before.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.120]   Now we're going to sell everyone at a buck 29.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   I might add, but I think this is kind of like a football team that's losing 40 to 20.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.160]   And a lot of yards, they get a lot of yards and a lot of touchdowns, but I think that
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   it might be a little.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   But I think there's revenue.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   I think there's revenue here.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.760]   So there's one thing that's worth, I think we're three iterating.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.880]   We, I think I said this before someone on the show has mentioned it before, but I learned
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.280]   this not long ago.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   I, it drives me that crap crazy.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.800]   I post a lot of videos on my stupid blog and like a lot, a lot of videos that people
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.520]   hate, but I love it.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.600]   And I'm forever having to go and hit the embed button to make sure it's embeddable.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.560]   Now anything by EMI, anything by Sony, anything by any of the majors, well, there's two things
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   at play here.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.840]   Number one is you can't embed.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.720]   This is what I almost any major label.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.560]   And number two, they've heavily police anybody who's trying to get around that by posting
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.840]   a wildcat.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.680]   And what I learned not long ago that I think is worth repeating it.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   People don't know it.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   Why that is YouTube only pays their little pennies for views to those guys if it's viewed
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.200]   on the YouTube site.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.320]   EMI does not get paid for an embed.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.720]   That is why videos are not.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.440]   Is that true for us?
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   It's true for everybody.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.560]   You don't make money on an embed.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.080]   Now to my end, chat room can check, check me on this.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   It's my understanding.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.520]   The only way YouTube will pay you, or maybe it's a matter of order of magnitude, difference
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   and payment.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.400]   But it's my understanding, the only payments they make.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   Makes sense.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   That's where the guys never come out.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   That's where the ads are.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.360]   But that's to me, that's so tilling.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   That's so tilling.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.280]   You know who paid for those videos in almost every instance?
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280]   The band.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.600]   The band paid for those videos.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.840]   It comes out as recoupable.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.840]   It comes straight out of their own money.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.960]   So with the police paid to have next to you, made.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.200]   Those are those crappy contracts, record label contracts.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   It's true to this day.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   You still pay if you're an artist.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.400]   Kgo, a very famous open letter to EMI.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.640]   Okay, go said you can't.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   All right, we're by.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   Right.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640]   Right.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.080]   But to your point, Leo, I think you're right about the publicity or the, publicity is maybe
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.600]   the wrong word, attention.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.040]   It's really about attention.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   And so you're very happy.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.200]   They're very happy to capitalize on the economies of scale and putting all this stuff up on
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   YouTube.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.600]   But they're not willing to really take that to the next level and say, well, we want
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.200]   to let people, you know, share this and so forth.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   It's still about the dough.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   Well, and I...
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.440]   This was a surprise image though.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.840]   I have to say when I saw this on Apple site.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.920]   I just didn't expect that.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.600]   I think we need to negotiate, Leo.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.360]   You know, I'll give you a five cents for the advertising rights on that.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.800]   Is that really Yoko's legs or did you put her head on somebody else?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.960]   No, no, I just, I did a bad magic wand job.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.760]   But I'm not as pure Yoko.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.600]   Wow.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.720]   That this is from the four mentioned blog Kung Fu grip that you also put us in.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.880]   I love it.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.800]   That's the one thing, by the way, you don't normally ever see if we've done it.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.760]   We've done our job properly.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.920]   On our show is this, because that's supposed to be cut out.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.440]   See, that's why the kids love that.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   That's what B roll.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   It's like a...
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   Behind the scenes.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.400]   Well, see, now we can cuss all we want because the editors are going to cut off.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.400]   They're very confused.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   They're very confused.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   They said, "Should I cut that?"
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.880]   From now on, unless I'm wearing the moo sandler.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.840]   We just showed this slide that we put up when we want the editors to cut for those of
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.320]   you listening on audio.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   No, anyway, yeah.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   Okay, go, okay, go.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.960]   Now, it'll be interesting to see.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.560]   I hope Clay Shrikey writes a similar article, the opposite of a paywall.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   Companies like Bands like, "Okay, go, leave an established label because EMI because they
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.000]   wouldn't allow them to embed videos and have a great video site and do a lot of great videos.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.560]   Does it help the band or not?"
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   That'll be an interesting...
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.280]   You know what it is, the last thing, and then I'll shut up forever, you wish, is that
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.440]   this is not about going, "Oh, I'm right about this.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   I'm right."
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.640]   Like, in my case, I'm always the strident.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   Nobody gets this guy.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.120]   But you know what I really am is I'm the guy who's willing to evolve about this.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.440]   And okay, go on Jonathan Colton.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.200]   Jonathan Colton gave away his songs, but now you got to pay for the old songs.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.840]   Yeah, Jonathan Colton's a nice guy, but he's also a guy who has to make a living.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   But you got to evolve.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.960]   It's not a question of whether you want to be right one time in 1972 or right one time
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.280]   in 2005.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.200]   It's about responding to the market in a way that makes even an Iota of sense.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.560]   Well, I think that you also have to look at the market and make sure that you're actually
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.120]   going into it in a way that makes sense for your listeners.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.840]   I mean, I think that we've seen successes.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.000]   I mean, DeFranco kind of built up her whole following without a label.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Is that true?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Yeah, she's never had a label.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.680]   No, I've bought her in record stores.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.720]   Oh, you bought in record stores, but is her own Lyser own label?
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.320]   You know, Nine Inch Nails gave, you know, put up their entire album, sold a collector's
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.680]   you know, version of it for $250 a pop sold 3,000 of them in a week.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.600]   But did they get, but did they get this kind of publicity on the Apple page?
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   That's the question.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   Oh, no, but they're not the Beatles.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   That's Beatles, right.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.480]   You know, so a lot of bands that are happy to give it away.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.160]   It's just just just be aware of it.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   And then they evolve.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.560]   And then if they can sell, you know, an EP at a show, it'll be kind of blatant.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.160]   Commercialism is going to.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.800]   York some Beatles fans.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.600]   Oh, I never see the Beatles cartoons.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.320]   I guess they were the first band really to do this.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.120]   There's George, by the way, without a cigarette because we wouldn't want the kids to think
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.920]   that George smoked and died of cancer or anything.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   Right.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.880]   That's a very it's a very they have a very limited number of pictures in these.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.480]   In some ways, it's almost been useful to leave that cigarette in to remind people that.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.880]   Yeah, it's not a good thing.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.000]   Yeah, I think I think Ken Burns is getting eight cents for every three of these.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.600]   It is the Ken Burns pan.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:52.840]   They're also and you know, we know that the Apple iTunes and iPod ads sell music because
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.120]   they've a lot of unknown bands have sold a lot of records because of being featured on
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   Apple.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.200]   I mean, and the app has some huge value, doesn't it?
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Mine.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   We'll notice they pick one song for each ad.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.040]   And I guarantee you those five songs are going to end up on the best on the list.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.680]   We were watching an app with the iPhone, the iPad ad last night.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.480]   And there was one where you trace over the over the letters.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.640]   My wife looked at it and said, I need you to put that on your side.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.640]   Me too.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640]   She's like, I need you to get back.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.880]   Well, it works because they actually now have a section on the iTunes on the app store
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.640]   that says stuff you saw on TV.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.680]   And I was talking to a developer who said it's like, it's just like, you know, from
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.680]   happen.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.480]   I mean, you get on one of those ads and it's just you just printing money.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   So I did not wait for the Beatles to do this.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.040]   I last year bought the box set.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.560]   Most Beatles fans agree that was the thing to do by the remastered box set.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.280]   Did you get the stereo or the mono Merlin?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.120]   Or I bet you got both.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.440]   We've got to go mono.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   No question.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   Okay.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   See how about stereo?
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   One of mine.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   No, no, they're both good.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   I've got them both.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   That's what I thought.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   All right.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440]   And I've got the EBITS remasters.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   I got them all.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.440]   That's the good stuff to go for the EBITS.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440]   If you have a computer.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   I don't know.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   I don't have a computer.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.360]   But I get the EBITS bootlegs.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   That's what you need.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.720]   But no, the mono was the true mix of most those records.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.800]   That's the mix that they supervised and approved of.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   But one more item.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   One more item.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.280]   And then we'll move on to other news because there's a lot of other news.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.520]   There was, I think for some reason, I thought it was pretty obvious it was a Beatles announcement.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.640]   Then got confirmation from a source yesterday that yes, it is a Beatles announcement.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.800]   There was a lot of speculation.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.200]   Oh, maybe you're going to change the world.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   Maybe you'll do subscription.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   Right.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.720]   Well, I still think that's the scorched earth.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.960]   I mean, that is like nothing left in the news.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   No competition.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.880]   Peter Kafka pointed out in all things digital on the web that this couldn't be because there's
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.080]   been no noise at all from the record labels that we're making a deal with Apple and they
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.000]   would absolutely have to go along with this.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.240]   So it's this is it.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.040]   This is the Beatles catalog and nothing more.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.840]   Well, I mean, I don't, I, yesterday morning, I was pretty certain that it had to be some
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.400]   sort of an expansion of content and not a new feature because too many other things would
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.560]   have had to have happened in order to make to add new features to iTunes.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.860]   And one of the biggest cues was the fact that every indication was just that we're going
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.040]   to make an announcement tomorrow by just updating the website.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   Right.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.440]   If it were something that it wasn't something that was going to require a live demo to show
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   off.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   Here's how this works now.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.960]   Here's why there's a new button in iTunes.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.840]   And here's why you need to download a new version of iOS.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.880]   If Apple had yet another invitation to go to Cupertino, which would have been like the
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.800]   third and the last three months, they would have had to do that.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.360]   They could have just done something at Town Hall that simply said, Oh, by the way, we're
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.200]   going to be broadcasting live from Town Hall with Steve Jobs and we would have already
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.040]   special guests and shoe earns.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.520]   We'll leave you to, we'll leave you to fill it.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520]   It was interesting.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.880]   The semiotics of the announcement, my friend Norman, who's a beatologist pointed out that
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:54.560]   the red circle around the four clocks was an echo of the semaphore from the help album
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   cover.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.160]   And if you juxtapose them, it is.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.840]   It's the same red oval and the Beatles, of course, are going like this, but the clock
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.560]   hands echo the Beatles hands.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.080]   I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.560]   No, see, not really.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.560]   I mean, I've got it in front of me.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.520]   I have a screen capture of the other thing on my site.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.080]   I'm looking at it right now and I don't see any red oval and also.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.280]   Oh, there's no red oval?
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   Maybe Norman added it.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.680]   So when somebody mentioned the hands to me, I, of course, that's going to look for look
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.880]   at the help album cover and no, the hands don't really match up.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Never mind that.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.480]   In retrospect, you can see why there are four clock hands, but it's, but yesterday, when
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.040]   people were saying, oh, that's, that's it.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   That's the slam dunk.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.160]   I'm saying, no, it's not a slam dunk.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   It's the number four.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.080]   It appears in horology all over the place.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.720]   When are we going to get horology?
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.440]   Speaking of tour buses.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.240]   When are we going to get?
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.960]   When are we going to get the North Carolina things going online into the year?
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.360]   When are we going to get that announcement?
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.920]   And what is it going to be?
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.880]   The North Carolina facility, it's like it is, it is to Apple rumors what the guy at Dilly
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.960]   Plaza with the umbrella is the Kennedy assassination.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.160]   Every time you have some sort of cockamamie theory and you're looking for evidence that,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.920]   yes, your cockamamie theory is true.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.200]   Well, you know, they're building that data center and top secret that nobody's supposed
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   to know about.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.880]   Like, well, no, it's the Apple area 51.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:20.040]   So this is just Norman's edit by putting the oval in and juxtaposing it with the Beatles.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   You're right.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.200]   The hands don't match except the last two hands match kind of sort of.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.040]   Last, well, no, the last, well, the third one matches.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.840]   That's definitely three o'clock.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   Well done that man.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:40.080]   But that's as usual, Paul gets it right and the rest of the guys, you know, two stone
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.440]   to even care.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.840]   They're on their skiing holiday.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.240]   They agreed to do some shooting and some video, whatever after that.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.680]   Let's say, where is where's Dylan when we need him?
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.560]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.280]   There are some very big stories.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.960]   One just broke.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.880]   It's not in our rundown.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.320]   And Merlin has story two for us.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.880]   This show brought to you by our good friends at Drobo.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.720]   We just got a the new Drobo S Alex with the 3.0 USB and all that.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   I did.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.520]   I have it in the Lindsey Labs.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   And the big thing is now you have you have a Firewire 800, you have USB 3, E Seda.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.400]   So you really have a future proof, you know, Drobo S that is going to be, you're going
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.320]   to be able to, you know that for the next couple of years, all the major connectivity
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   pieces that you have.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.520]   And otherwise it works just like another Drobo.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.440]   And it's, you know, it's such a, it's a little safety blanket.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   You know, it is.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   We love it.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440]   It's really, really awesome.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.200]   For those who don't know, I mean, we talk about it so much.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.440]   I'm sure everybody knows, but it's it's an enclosed drive enclosure of a variety of different
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.080]   kinds.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.520]   From four to eight disks.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.640]   It, it, it, it, data redundancy.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.040]   So you can never lose a data hot, swappable drive.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.440]   So you increase storage easily.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.840]   And people will say, oh, well, you can do that with RAID 5 and you can do it.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.760]   But yeah, but if you know what you're doing and you keep everything the same and there's
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.320]   paris, there's a lot more technology.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.120]   If you just want to have something that works or you can have a drive fail and you can just
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.880]   pull it out and replace it.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.240]   When you fill it up, you can kind of softly, you know, increase the capacity.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.360]   There's just nothing easier, you know, if you don't want to be thinking about it, we
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.360]   love Drobo.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.600]   Now, but we got a special Thanksgiving special, a special Thanksgiving special.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.640]   Is that redundant?
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.200]   This is the new Drobo URL.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   You've got to use this one.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:32.000]   I'm going to change the, the link on our, on our video because it is now Drobo.com/mbw299.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.960]   Drobo.com/mbw299.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.400]   This is only good through Black Friday, midnight Friday, November 26th.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.920]   You have to purchase it from the Drobo store.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   Here you go.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.920]   Get ready.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   Stand back.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.840]   This is good for listeners in North America, UK and the EU.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.240]   Save $100 off the purchase of a four drive Drobo.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   When you go to Drobo store.com, use the code MBW299, all caps or $125 off a Drobo bundle
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.720]   populated with hard drives.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   That's a good deal.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   $100 off the Drobo, four drive Drobo enclosure.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.440]   You got to be in North America for that second deal to $125 off the purchase of the Drobo.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.400]   It's a great, it's a great, boy, that's a great price.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.480]   Great price and it's a great value.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.520]   I mean, it just really is the, you know, we, that's the original Drobo.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.920]   We've got kind of gone from using one terabytes to two terabytes.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.160]   So I'm slowly moving all my Drobo's to two terabytes.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.920]   That's eight terabytes of storage.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.280]   It's 10 with the five, with the five discs.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.280]   Amazing.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.720]   And, and, you know, and, and I paid $11,000 for X-ray.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.440]   That's all I want to say.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.760]   It's got seven, seven gigs of, I'm sorry, seven terabytes of storage.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.280]   Well, you know what they, you know what they say.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   You put, you put all of your stuff.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.640]   But why am I saying it when we could let the singer sing it?
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.680]   Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.320]   Drobo.com/MBW299 off her ends.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   November, what did I say, 26th Friday at midnight.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.440]   And that was recorded during the revolve for recording sessions, but it was ultimately
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.400]   not released and sold as a B side of one of the lead B sessions, I think.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.840]   And then of course, there's this one Australian B side.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.960]   They recorded this during a visit to Algeria.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.920]   Brian Jones, very famously spiked.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.800]   They're matcha.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   During one of Lenin's famous lost weekends.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.560]   Yes.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.600]   Item two, ladies and gentlemen, from Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.880]   Oh, what did I say I was going to talk about?
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   I knew that was coming.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.960]   I knew you would do that.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.200]   That's why I threw it to you.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.400]   I don't even, I don't remember either.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.560]   Did I say I was going to say something?
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.600]   Yeah, remember you said I want item two, but maybe it was more Beatles.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.960]   Oh, we're done with the Beatles.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.600]   Oh, I don't want to talk about the many more.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   Because I'll handle number three.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   Okay.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:56.520]   By the way, what we don't know is whether Rhapsody Napster, one of these, one of the
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.720]   these guys going to get a bay tools.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.800]   I'm going to guess that if Apple put so much PR into it, they get a little bit of exclusive
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   for a while.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   Six months, something like that.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.880]   Well, the only thing we know for sure is that they have an exclusive through at least
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   January.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.560]   All things D, I think, interviewed someone about it and they said that it's secure through
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.200]   2011, but they would not be drawn out into a specific, how long for a specific day.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.600]   One thing Apple did not do, we all thought that Apple never said, I might point out,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.240]   all the rumor mill said that Friday, 10 AM Pacific time Apple, yes, last Friday, that
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:34.840]   Apple would release iOS 4.2 and then they released iTunes 10.1.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.360]   I was talking to someone in the Pixel core today and she was like, yeah, I, you know,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.920]   Carolyn was saying that she would be more excited about the iOS four for her iPad than
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   the Beatles.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   So what's the deal?
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   The again, rumor mill.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   We don't know.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.200]   Apple doesn't say, but rumor mill was there was a Wi-Fi issue.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.720]   I, Steve's not here.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   Is he?
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.400]   I put four to the develop, I paid 99 bucks to be developed because I wanted to, I still
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   do want to develop.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.600]   You probably have the developer.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.520]   So we got 4.2 as a result.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.320]   We can't talk about it.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.120]   I can't talk about it either.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.120]   None of us can talk about it.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.600]   Long silence.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:20.400]   But I could probably say that I, I tried it and the goal master seemed quite robust.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.840]   I didn't see any Wi-Fi issues.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.240]   So I don't know what's holding it on.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.000]   It's, it does every day it feels more dated when you're used to, when you go back and
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.960]   forth from an iPhone four to the, to the iPad, they need to do this.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   Right.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   Frustrating.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   Air print is, or yeah, air print.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   Is that what they call it?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.200]   Air print is in the 10.1.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.680]   You need that.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.040]   Air play is also in 10.1.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.840]   You need the air print to print air play to what?
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.760]   I think it's to watch the videos and listen to music from your, from your, from your,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.560]   from an iTunes server.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   I believe you got it.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   Or from, you know, from another computer with iTunes.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   Got it.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   Got it.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   Got it.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   Got it.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   Got it.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   Got it.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560]   Got it.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.560]   Got it.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.560]   Got it.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.560]   They did also push a huge patch 10.5.6 was ginormous.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.680]   In fact, a record for the most patches on, on, on OS 10.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.920]   Lots of security fixes.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.960]   Everything anybody, I guess, was super worried about, but 10, 6, aka snow leopard and 10,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:24.440]   5, aka leopard, both received patches fixing a hundred and thirty vulnerabilities.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   Wow.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   When they're listening to somebody.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.480]   Yeah, except they're not listening to Charlie Miller, the guy who continually wins and pwned
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.960]   own up there in Vancouver.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.760]   You know, the first person to take over a Windows Mac or Linux machine, he always wins.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:46.080]   Usually by finding flaws in Safari, he says, Apple released a huge patch on Twitter, but
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.880]   still misses all my bugs.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:55.480]   He says, makes you realize how many bugs are in their code or they're very unlucky.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.520]   So there's still stuff out there, according to a Charlie.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.480]   Look, there's a lot of stuff in the wild.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480]   None in the wild.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   They're, they're known.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   Right.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.760]   Now the truth is they may even be in the wild, but if you're a bad guy and you know that
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.880]   95% of the market is held by Windows machines, three quarters of which are not patched, what
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.200]   are you going to write malware for?
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.680]   I said a real number.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.600]   95% are a real number.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.120]   We don't know how many unpatched Windows machines they're about.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.400]   But every time I see a stat, it's more than half.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   Right.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.240]   So you, so let's say there's a 150 million unpatched Windows machines.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.800]   Who are you going to, who are you going to call?
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.840]   I mean, everybody's, it's an illusion to think that any of us are that secure.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.680]   Fortunately, I mean, you can put precautions in.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.160]   There's more precautions, but the thing I always think about, because my racket is, you
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.120]   know, there's productivity stuff and things like email.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.600]   And I think it's so interesting that, you know, you think about, like, Mittnick has said,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   you know, a lot of it's just social engineering.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   Right.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.920]   You don't, the thing is, if you put anything in email, you know, you don't need to just,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.000]   you don't need to get into the most secure person in the world's email.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.320]   You need to get into the, they're like assistance email or whatever.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.680]   It's like your email is everybody else's email too.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.880]   Your files, the thing that freaks me out about Dropbox in particular in some ways is that
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.080]   until they really, really, really, really support sparse images, the way I want to use
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.240]   them, you know, anything that you put in Dropbox and share with people is in their Dropbox.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.040]   And there's nothing to keep them from making their password pencil.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   Right.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.840]   And I think that as more stuff goes in the cloud and as more stuff gets shared through
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.640]   things like email or even services like Facebook, I mean, there's whatever.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.960]   There's just so much stuff that we're counting on, you know, a well-maintained MySQL database
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.640]   to take care of.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.280]   You know, it's the password to get into Twitter's intranet was happiness.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   Right.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   You'll remember.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.880]   I mean, it's, I don't know.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.480]   I have to admit, I have complained many times about the fact that every time I buy an application
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.760]   on my, you know, on the iTunes store that I have to put in my password, which is a little
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   bit of a hash.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.600]   So it's really a pain in the neck to do.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.520]   And I didn't think it was that, I mean, I thought it was a real pain in the neck and
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.760]   tell my son figured out how to get to the App Store.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.120]   Like three year old son goes to the App Store.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.160]   And I see him constantly going up there and then banging around and not being able to
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.960]   order it because he can't put the password in him.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   Like, that's good.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   Thank you.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   Hello level security.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Google's finally introduced.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.560]   I'm going to talk about my butt.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.360]   I don't, I don't, I'm not, I'm not like, you know, a pro on this stuff, but the, you
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.440]   know, two levels of authentication, which I think is a pretty good idea.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.560]   I think stuff like Dropbox should start introducing that.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.760]   And you might have like an Alex's case.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.880]   I, this is something I would love on iOS is two levels of security.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.480]   I'd like a screen door for stuff like, you know, you're talking about two factor authentication
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   where there's a login and password.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.280]   And then you have a card or it sends you a text message with something you have, something
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.200]   physically that you have that is then required in addition, which is too, too, too, too clear
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   text strings.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.920]   If you think about it, or just still too clear text strings, doesn't matter if it's a thousand
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.240]   characters long copy and paste still works.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.880]   It's, it's, there's, um, you know, with my phone, I agree Alex and I have my set to kind
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.840]   of, you know, uh, you know, lock and stuff like that.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.880]   But I mean, how many times have we seen where there's an emergency call, uh, bug seems like
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   almost a release.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.040]   There's an emergency call bug where you can just hit a couple things and unlock it.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.280]   Um, I don't know.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.400]   I think, I don't know if sparse images are the answer, but, uh, the problem with something
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.600]   like Dropbox is if you keep stuff on a sparse image, at least in my experimenting with it.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.520]   And by that, I just mean it's a disk image that's, you know, pretty well encrypted.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.760]   It's a folder with encryption, basically.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.600]   And the problem is if it's mounted somewhere, um, I don't think it's, it only sinks when
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   it's unmounted.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.040]   So it's not like you can really treat it like a network drive.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:40.920]   I mean, I think that's metaphorically symbolic of where this stuff should go, which is kind
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.600]   of like, uh, what?
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.000]   It's like a safe inside of a safe, you know what I mean?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.280]   Like you could have kind of trivial stuff sitting around on your coffee table, but you
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.600]   know, you're going to put your crew, your hands in something a little more secure.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   I always have the, I don't encrypt my entire hard drive, but I always have a sparse image,
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.160]   an encrypted sparse image on there for anything that is important enough that I want to make
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.600]   sure that if God forbid my laptop gets stolen or if someone gets access to it, that, uh,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.320]   that it's got it's the one file on the hard drive that has like that that really stupid
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.280]   42 character long string of almost random numbers and digits because that's where the
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   important stuff goes.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.720]   But the, but I think the important lesson is that, uh, I love Dropbox.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.480]   I don't think there's a bigger supporter of Dropbox than I, uh, and I'm an avid user,
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.600]   but I still have to, I still can't lose sight of that basic mentality that I'm not going
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.200]   to put on anything on cloud storage that would embarrass humility, humiliate me, humiliate
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   me, expose me to legal issues if I had it up there.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.840]   So that's why, you know, if there's, if I need to share a picture with somebody, uh,
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.680]   and it's not, and it's, uh, I'm not talking about groups pictures.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.100]   I'm talking about, you know, you're at the Christmas party and you don't necessarily
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.600]   want to post pictures of all your friends, uh, to your public Flickr feed, but that's
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.040]   a sort of thing where, okay, I don't know.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.580]   I don't care if it is going to be an eight megabyte file attached, but I'm really going
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.120]   to have to send that directly because I have to say that everything in my Dropbox is going
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   to be found.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.280]   And everybody, everybody acts like this is like real, like, you know, tin foil hat stuff,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.440]   but then you look at the, I mean, actually, um, was it, uh, Jeff Atwood had a great post
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.920]   about the, um, what was it called?
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.000]   The Firefox thing that could steal cookies through the air.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Anyway, Jeff from, yeah, Jeff from, um, uh, what is it?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.180]   Uh, coding horror set a site.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.100]   Uh, smart guy does stack overflow.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.980]   Uh, he, he, uh, got a great post about this.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.260]   He's like, you know, this is, this is what it is.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:36.500]   It's been, there's a reason, you know, that, uh, cookies and, uh, SSL kind of kind of came
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.900]   about on the web at the same time, HTTPS or whatever that implementation, because people
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.980]   understood that what a cookie is, a cookie is a string.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.140]   It's not like some magical thing that's like locked in a secret box.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   It's a string.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.820]   And if that gets passed, you know, I mean, I, I've had sites, I've used sites over the
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:57.420]   years where the documented way to log in was by passing clear texts, passwords in an
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   URL.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.780]   And so like, you know, you put that in Google reader, you know, there's stuff like that
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.860]   everywhere.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.520]   And what he's saying is basically, hey, you know, in some ways, yeah, it's awful that
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.220]   this thing is out there, but it's really just making it clear to people exactly what Andy
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.700]   is saying, which is, you know, just cause your password is, you know, hard to type,
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.940]   doesn't make it, doesn't mean you're immune.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   And if you're going to, you go to Starbucks, somebody's going to sniff it.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.620]   And if you're an Apple user, you shouldn't assume that, uh, just because there aren't
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:29.460]   a lot of targeted, uh, why, uh, rather a lot of viruses in the wild that are not targeted,
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.020]   uh, you know, if you're a company using Mac spearfishing, people are going to say, oh,
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.020]   let's go after pixel core.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.740]   And we know they use a lot of Macs.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:40.780]   Let's take one of these remaining vulnerabilities and send an email to everybody at pixel core.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.580]   This kind of spearfishing is of real concern.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.420]   So if you, if you do have a company running Macs, you got to be, well, I don't know what
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.860]   to, I don't know what to sometimes what to trust.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.340]   I got an email, um, from you earlier.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.340]   Don't trust that.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:56.340]   No, no, no, it was like, but I was like, I never put an attachment on an email.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:00.140]   No, no, no, it's not an attachment, but like an invitation, you know, um, from, you know,
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.980]   and, and, uh, but I don't know whether it's a lot of times I just don't know anymore.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.980]   Right.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.100]   I get to a point where I don't know whether that link is valid or not.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.100]   People send me like plaque.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   So I don't, I don't really know.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.100]   Like, this is the kind of thing.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.460]   If you do get email from me, you'll, you will get an attachment.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.220]   You'll get a, an S, my attachment.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:19.020]   You'll get a, um, a secure certificate that will let you know that I send it.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.940]   If you don't have, if you get email from me that doesn't have a certificate on it, I
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   didn't send it.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.580]   It was the first time you open up a console.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:29.060]   Uh, let's say, let's say you do what Apple wants you to do and you run, there's several
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.700]   things about what Apple would like you to do that are worth looking at.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:37.620]   Uh, the canonical example, I think being, uh, you have a password for your mobile me,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.620]   right?
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.940]   They want you to put everything on mobile me, which is, which is swell.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:46.060]   Um, but then like you say, Alex, you know, if you want to go buy something on your iPhone,
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.460]   there's the one password that you would use to buy stuff.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.020]   And they had problems with this, by the way.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.020]   They've been, right.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.260]   Well, and anybody here on an Apple TV, anybody, an old school, everybody, anybody ever try
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.140]   to enter a secure password using the white.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.140]   Oh man.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   That's no fun.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.540]   I mean, I've never gotten an on less than like the fourth try.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.540]   And so what do you do?
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.540]   You dumb it down.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.540]   Right.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.740]   And that, and combine that with something like, like mobile me, anybody ever opens up console
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.340]   and goes and checks their log on their firewall, it would blow your mind.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.060]   Um, just watching, if you open up the log, sorry, if you open up the log on a, on a,
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:22.820]   on a time machine or a, you know, time capsule or whatever, the log on just the port scanning
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.540]   will curl your hair, you know, right?
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   That's absolutely true.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:32.740]   Uh, among other patches on this, there were four flash patches, Apple apparently still
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.260]   fixing flash for Adobe.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.420]   That was nice of them.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.620]   Uh, actually, I'm sorry.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.700]   Did I say four 55?
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:49.380]   I mean, I mean, it'll be 55 flash patches of the non flash patches were 41% 41% of the
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.260]   total fixed in 10, six, five.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:57.740]   Um, well, something that that's that executable, I think is always, yeah, flashes is going
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.260]   to be a nasty, nasty problem.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.620]   Um, let's see.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   What else?
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:10.780]   I mean, non flash patches 16 were related to X 11, Apple's X window system, nine affected
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:17.100]   quick time for where an OS 10's image IO component, another four in Apple type services, the
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.100]   font renderer.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:25.340]   Um, so there's some, you know, these are, these are some deep roots into the operating
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.380]   system here that presumably would allow code to be executed.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:35.500]   Um, three of the nine quick time vulnerabilities were reported by HP's tipping point.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:39.700]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:46.340]   Nick, or I'm sorry, Nils, a researcher works at MMWR info security in Basingstoke, England
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.860]   reported one of the quick time flaws.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.180]   I'm just giving credit where credits do.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.220]   Uh, please hold your applause.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.220]   Hold your applause to the end.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.220]   There's quad 139 of them.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:02.580]   Well, people are when people are, it is, they gave the technical Oscars, didn't they?
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.580]   I was so sad that they did the Irving Thalberg award already.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.420]   Yeah, I'm not even going to do that on, uh, on stage.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   And what is it?
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.420]   February.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.620]   But I'm sure that every single second of the telecast will be absolute gold.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.620]   Single wasted moment.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:25.340]   I just, I'm sure we'll have 10 minutes of awkward Harrison Ford.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.860]   You taught a generation, but it was like a dream in your character.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.500]   I asked an actor, uh, Oh, Chan-Towered.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.020]   I just have to admit that I just can't, you know, who won the Irving Thalberg this year?
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.020]   I don't.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   Francis Ford Coppola.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.020]   Just think.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.020]   Oh, nice.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.020]   Just think what a great montage.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.020]   And what a man.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.020]   That would have made.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.020]   That would have made.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.020]   Coppola.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.020]   Shmopola.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.340]   Um, I still haven't forgiven him for one from a heart.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.900]   I think that might be, that might be Eli Wallach.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.620]   Got an honorary Oscar.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.020]   You know how old Eli Wallach is?
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.020]   He's still alive.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.020]   He's still 95 years old.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.020]   I love it.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.380]   Is that, uh, is that too co-binatic to go on Maria Ramirez?
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.620]   Wasn't he in, uh, good, the bad, and ugly?
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.620]   Was that Eli Wallach?
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:12.620]   I might have been.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.220]   I think he was on the waterfront.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.220]   I mean, this guy's been around a long time.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:24.460]   Um, Jean-Luc Gada, Coda, who got an honorary Oscar and said, I will not accept.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.700]   So do not give it to me.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.700]   And an Indian.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.020]   Pick it up for him.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.340]   Uh, anyway, uh, I don't know how I got it.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.340]   Eli Wallach.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.340]   Eli Wallach was Tuko.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.340]   That's a hell movie.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.340]   Yeah, that's a good.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.260]   Uh, I'm sure there's more Mac news.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.260]   Let's take a break and come back and we'll find it for you.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.340]   And maybe you'll find, find your number two.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.700]   I'm on a head.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.220]   The head to head of the blueberry tablet against the iPad and web browsing.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.220]   We could talk about that.
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.380]   I have some tablets here, by the way.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.580]   I've been playing with the Samsung Galaxy tab.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.580]   Don't laugh.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   You know what?
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.580]   No, I'm sure it's cool.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.740]   I think Steve was wrong about seven inches.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.940]   Seven inches is enough.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.660]   We talked about that.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.660]   I got mine.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.780]   I got mine a few days ago too.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.140]   I kind of like it, but we'll talk about that.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.260]   And then, uh, uh, we got a number of, uh, Android.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.660]   These are all Android devices, so I should probably just save it for the twig show.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.340]   But a couple of really impressive, yeah, it's not a good phone, but a couple of really
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.940]   impressive low cost Android devices, uh, from our coast.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.860]   Um, I'm, I had first thought Android was not going to make a, and seven inches, not
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.100]   going to be a good choice.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.780]   I, I, I, I, I modify that, but I'll be very curious what you have to say, Andy.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.700]   So we'll, we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:43.140]   Um, before we do, I would like to mention our good friends at hover.com.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:47.380]   In fact, if you're ready to domain, do a domain thing, you're going to register a domain
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.380]   name.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.380]   Right.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.580]   You know, and I know there are many of us who, uh, as soon as we hear a good name, we
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.940]   go, I got to register that.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.460]   Can I recommend Macbrake.hover.com.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.460]   It's clean.
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.460]   It's simple.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.460]   It's efficient.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.660]   They don't over upsell you with a lot of here.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.660]   Try this.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   Try this one.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.660]   This is charged up.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.660]   You get a chance to see how that, how that works.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.660]   And I'll charge up this.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:11.300]   Unfortunately, the Samsung requires a proprietary 30 pin charger.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.300]   So it's not charged up.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.300]   Bring it home.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.460]   Hover.com does some very basic things.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.020]   Of course they do the DNS redirection.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.740]   So if you're going to set up a domain name points to your site, they also do email.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.540]   They'll do email forwarding.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.780]   Um, they do have very good privacy controls.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.260]   In fact, you know, the other guys will charge you for domain name privacy.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.540]   It's built into the hover, uh, registration.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.060]   Hover domain transfers are free.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.340]   They do charge $10 to extend the domain registration one year past its current expiration
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.340]   date.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.340]   See, I think that's a good deal.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.100]   Um, you want to try it?
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:50.820]   Go to Macbreak dot hover.com Macbreak dot hover.com.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.360]   It's from the folks at two cows used to be domains direct.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.720]   Maybe you know that name better.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.500]   It's a, we're moving all of our sites over those other guys locked my sites.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.860]   They do that at the drop of a hat.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.900]   So I have to wait till next month to get the rest of them.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.060]   You know, you know, it's better.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.300]   Locked it because of what?
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   Whoa.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.180]   Uh, you know, some bad guy to take your site away from you.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.500]   That's very network solutions.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.660]   Yeah, they're all that way, except for hover.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.660]   I love hover.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.660]   Watch it.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.660]   Try it right now.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.660]   They also have a great no hold policy for calls during business hours.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.660]   They guarantee you they're going to solve that problem without putting you in hold.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:30.140]   And let me tell you after being on hold for a long time about my locked domains.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.100]   I kind of appreciate that.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.260]   And it wasn't with hover, of course, uh, Macbreak dot hover.com.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.940]   If you do have a lot of domains to transfer, they have a flat fee.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.940]   They transfer pricing.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.940]   I think it's 25 bucks.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.700]   I wish I'd done it for as you know, thousands of sites if you want.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.660]   They'll do it all for you.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.660]   Macbreak dot hover.com.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.980]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.780]   And don't forget to use the Macbreak coupon code because I think you get 10%.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   Yes.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:00.580]   You get 10% off your domain registration offer code Macbreak.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.620]   Uh, do you, do you know, do you know what number two is yet?
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.140]   I think I might have had a stroke Leo.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.660]   I don't remember ever saying that.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:13.740]   I'd love a side by side comparison of something, something tablet.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.100]   That sounds so that sounds cool.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.460]   People love these tablet stuff.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:23.600]   Well, you know, I think my, my initial opinion before I saw any of these, uh, non apple
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.580]   tablets was it's going to be just like it was with the iPhone where it's going to take
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.820]   a couple of years for people to figure out what that secret sauce is.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.940]   Um, but what, what's different is, uh, Android is fairly mature.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.500]   This Samsung Galaxy tab comes with 2.2.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.620]   Uh, it is seven inches.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.620]   Beautiful screen.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.860]   I know you'd agree with me on that, Andy.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.860]   Very, very lovely screen.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.860]   Yes.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.460]   It's not, uh, it's not Samsung's, uh, super amoled, but it's a very good LCD screen.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.820]   Um, yes.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.940]   And I, you know, I remember I'm an Android fan.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.940]   I use it.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.300]   Droid X is my primary phone long ago, having given up on the iPhone as a phone phone.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.220]   Um, but, but Andy, I know you're an iPhone fan and not an Android fan.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.100]   What do you think of the, uh, Galaxy tab?
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.900]   Uh, I like it a lot.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.540]   The, the, my real review is not going to hit until next week.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:13.580]   Uh, but it has a couple of different features that no other Android tab that we've seen before
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.580]   this has.
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:18.860]   Number one, if you put an Apple logo on this, you would not really question that this was
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.860]   an Apple product.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.860]   It's beautifully built.
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.860]   The build quality superb.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.620]   They probably tried, they wouldn't make it out of plastic and they'd probably make
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.700]   it a little bit flatter, but it looks very, very solidly made.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.940]   It looks like a very, very nicely done thing.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.900]   Um, the, the processor is fast enough.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.340]   The screen is very nice.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.240]   Uh, it's very, very weird taking a picture like this, but it's a case, it's got a front
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.740]   facing and rear facing camera, but at disappointingly 3.2 megapixel rear facing camera.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.900]   Well, I mean, if you, if you're using this for real photography, you're kind of missing
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.900]   the boat.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.260]   Um, well, they could have put a better camera on the damn thing.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.940]   I, they, they could have, but what's the point?
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:59.460]   Uh, the, the, the, the real thing that I'm getting into is that I like it a lot, but,
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.220]   and this is going to sound like a really, really snarky comment, but it's not meant
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.580]   to be snarky.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:10.260]   It cuts through most of the complaints that I have about the Android user interface.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.020]   This is not a tablet interface.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:16.460]   There's almost no modifications made to take advantage of the larger screen real estate,
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:21.500]   but the simple fact that, uh, that there is more room for the basic user interface makes
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.980]   that interface work better.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:23.980]   I agree.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:28.420]   Typically, typically like the Android, the Android user interface looks like you filled
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:34.380]   a burrito with user interface elements and then ate it on top of the, the tablet because
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.380]   that's exactly what it looks like.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.380]   I'm not trying to agree with that.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.460]   It looks like it's just like you just got randomly dumped things all over the place.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.560]   It makes no sense.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.140]   When you put it on a tiny, tiny little phone, it really doesn't work exceptionally well.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:50.300]   I'm always just saying, okay, which of these nine buttons grouped incredibly closely together
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.800]   do the thing that I want to do, keeping in mind that three of them are some sort of a
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.540]   circle with an arrow on it.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:59.500]   Uh, but when you, when you really stretch it out like this, it really does become a much,
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:00.700]   much more compelling product.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.060]   Also, I've been carrying it around for the past three or four days and I love my iPad,
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.860]   uh, but the iPad is still something that I have to make sort of a conscious decision.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:14.700]   Uh, the brains that take with me, like Andy has momentarily moved off microphone off.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.980]   I mean, I mean, and now he's back.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.820]   Take a, take a look at, yeah, I mean, just, you just take a look at this and that's when
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.420]   you see the difference in portability between these two machines.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.260]   I mean, you can really fit two of these onto one of those.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.220]   Well, that's exactly what Steve Jobs is saying.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.740]   Seven inches sounds like it's close to 10, but it's really only half the real estate.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.740]   Right.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.940]   And that's, and that's actually the advantage.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:40.260]   But the difference between that is that it's still, this was, people initially complained
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.580]   that the iPad was just a really, really big phone.
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:46.100]   And of course you use this for exactly four hours and you realize that, no, this is nothing
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.060]   like a, just a big phone.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.860]   This really is kind of just a really big phone.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:55.140]   It has a big keyboard and it makes it easy to hunt and peck, uh, with one finger and type
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.140]   on it.
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.380]   It really is not something you can type on holding it horizontally.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.020]   I find it really difficult to, I can't really stretch my thumbs enough.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.460]   I kind of liked it though, that in vertical orientation, you couldn't, you, you can in
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.180]   fact, yeah, the camera on you can in fact type with your thumbs.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.620]   Yeah, I mean, the, the, the vertical one works great.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.060]   Also it has swipe, which I absolutely, the best keyboards for Android.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.020]   My, the batteries did on this, but you can see this is, it's funny.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.820]   This is, you can actually use this with one hand.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.300]   I don't mind the seven inches.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:29.700]   And by the way, a number of people complained to all the Android apps don't scale well.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.540]   Angry Birds scales great.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.540]   Everything, uh, I try.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.700]   What do you use it for, Leo?
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.780]   Well, I haven't, I don't really use it for anything, but I, and this is the, this is
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.860]   the one frustration.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.660]   It should be a phone too.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:44.620]   And then it might be a great replacement for an iPhone and an iPad together.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.820]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:50.060]   I think, I think that the, the success of this is going to be in just accepting that
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.420]   it's a totally different thing.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:56.160]   If you're putting this against an iPad, iPad, iPad wins every single time.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.940]   If you put it against a Kindle, if you put it against an iPhone and you simply say that
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.860]   this is not designed to do everything an iPad can do.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.700]   It's designed to be something you can sacrifice is you're willing to make in order to get
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.420]   something that you can toss in a jacket pocket.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:15.060]   I mean, I would not, I, I, I, as I said, so many times before, if I'm traveling for two
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.740]   or three days, I can travel with my iPad as my only computer.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:22.980]   And this, I would have to be making a conscious decision that I'm not going to be doing very
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.140]   much in terms of pushing electrons around if I were to rely on this as my only computer.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.140]   Right.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.140]   But that said, I do like it a lot.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.140]   I'm surprised.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.340]   I did not expect it.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.260]   It's probably my favorite Android device I've seen so far.
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:34.260]   I like it a lot.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:40.180]   I find it so hard to even participate in this conversation because, well, obviously, because
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.380]   I don't know the first thing about these particular computers, but really more, it's for me,
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.700]   it comes so much down to like extremely specific uses.
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.220]   It would be like asking me if I like paper, you know, I like, yeah, I like paper like
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.620]   what to make what?
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.020]   Oh, to make a drinking glass.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.540]   Well, no, that's not really good.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.460]   It's really good for writing on or whatever.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:02.620]   For me, like I still struggle a little bit with like what the iPad is for.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.540]   And that said, I do love it.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.540]   I do love it.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.860]   But today, for example, this morning I was debating, I had to, it doesn't matter why,
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:13.180]   but I've got to be out and about some today and I was debating, I need to do some writing.
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.340]   And I was debating, do I want to take my Mac book?
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   What is it?
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:24.060]   Whatever the 13 inch, what are the small Mac book is versus do I want to take my iPad?
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.340]   And this is a little bit of a straw, man, because this is my use case.
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:33.380]   Do I want to bring my iPad, my aluminum keyboard and my Mophie, giant ass power thing as a
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:38.060]   backup, just in case I use it for my phone and my wireless mostly?
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.780]   And you know, they wait almost the same.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.920]   And it's, I guess I'm trying to say, I don't think I'm the only person in the world who
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   struggles with that.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.140]   To quote, I forget who I'm quoting here.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.860]   I might be Andy, I forget, but somebody said that in the last week or so said, hey, I
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.900]   met up Marco, probably said this, my iPhone is really still the go to portable device.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.740]   I never have to think twice about the iPhone.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.580]   And in my case, honestly, I can type pretty freaking fast on an iPhone.
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:10.940]   I can type okay on the iPad even as I try, but if I really want to write, if I want to
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.820]   get more than 40 words per minute, I've got to use a keyboard.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:19.320]   So for me, that's why I ask Leo, I was trying to be like that guy, but it's like, to me,
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.560]   it all depends on what you want to use it for.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.520]   If you want to use it for calendaring for light email, it's just, you know, I think there's
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.600]   a elephant in the room with every single device, which is what are you going to use it for?
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.960]   I could see using this for everything that I would use an iPad for with the obvious exception.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:34.960]   But what is that?
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.760]   It's that it doesn't have the same apps.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.200]   So yeah, I think that for me, the apps are important.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:45.220]   I think that it's, I like the form, I do like the 16 by nine form factor a little better
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.220]   than the iPad.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.380]   So to answer one question, Merlin is great.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.380]   It's a great media player.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   It's actually a better media player than the iPad.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.540]   And I think it looks because of the widescreen.
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:54.540]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.540]   And I think it's easier to fit in the iPad.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.860]   I love watching Netflix on my iPad.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:02.100]   I watched the pianist the other night, which is a pretty long movie, "Pianist."
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.820]   And I watched, actually I watched the pianist too.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.820]   It's been in my queue for a while.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:10.720]   But I watched the pianist, like, oh my gut, like I laid on the couch and watched the pianist.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.240]   Great movie.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.560]   And I was amazing because what you guys said and I kind of laughed at back in the day, I
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.640]   did kind of forget that it was there.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:25.120]   If you find a comfortable position, I forget my pianist is there.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.640]   You just keep, I'm sorry.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.880]   See, no one even has to make jokes.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.120]   It's just that it works so well.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.640]   I feel as though I'm looking at a beautiful sunset.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.620]   I want to think it was be quiet and enjoyable.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.620]   You just have to be there to enjoy it.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.100]   But anyway, sometimes I had to shake it once or twice to have it come back to life, but
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.220]   still it goes to sleep.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.140]   It does go to sleep occasionally.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.140]   It's something I like.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.140]   If you touch it, it comes back awake.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.140]   Yeah, I'm so title.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:58:00.380]   I want to type something for Twitter on my iPhone and spend half an hour trying to write
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.420]   140 characters, I think, or funny.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.980]   And then I go to Undo and I stand there and I'm at the corner of Terreval on 19th Avenue
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.220]   in San Francisco going like this with my hand.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.260]   And I think that's perfect because that's exactly what I'm doing.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.260]   It's exactly.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.940]   This is better for tweeting.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:21.180]   This is in fact, Android has a really great application called Twitteroid that uses the
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.820]   landscape mode very well.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.020]   I find that with most of the Android ones that I've worked with so far and the one that
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.580]   I was just playing with, which one was that?
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   This is the Arco 7.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:30.580]   The Arco 7.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.820]   I do find that I always find that the fit and finish of the interface is not quite, I mean
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:41.180]   like the pinching and the stuff like that is not quite as smooth as you get with the
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.180]   iPad.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:45.620]   It's not quite as, it doesn't feel quite as fluid.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.780]   You keep noticing that it's like, "Oh, it's not quite the..."
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.780]   I think Android is like that.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.780]   Android is like that.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.780]   I used to.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.860]   D plus student that you know could be the A student if he really applied himself, but
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   he just can't be motivated.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.100]   I couldn't disagree more.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:04.460]   But anyway, as I'm well known for disagreeing with you, I think the Android is far superior.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:09.860]   In fact, some of that lag is part of the problem with multitasking.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.940]   I know you don't like it, Annie.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.100]   I think part of the problem is with multitasking.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.100]   This is a flaw in Android because it is an open platform.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:21.140]   People write bad apps and sometimes you get apps on here that really do cause it to be
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.140]   less responsive.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   Right.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:27.580]   Can I underscore what you're saying, Leo, in an incredibly cryptic way?
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:31.660]   Something that we mentioned earlier that none of us are going to mention, something that
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.860]   supposedly might come out Friday.
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:38.900]   Apparently, one of the last things they do when they're putting out an iOS or whatever
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.540]   is the performance tuning, I guess.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.900]   It makes sense for that to be the last thing you do.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.940]   You're not going to run the vacuum until you've dusted, right?
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:48.620]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:56.220]   And boy, can I just say I have noticed stuff with lagging on the iPhone that I, with this
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.580]   data that I never would have noticed otherwise.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.940]   Multitasking is not a good idea on these small devices, I think.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.940]   Well, you know what it is?
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.700]   It's such an interesting engineering constraint because you really are set upon on all sides.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.180]   And I think Apple is the one who is, if you would have met a four, you want to use, raise
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.340]   the bar for this is the iPhone.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:17.180]   I mean, I think the iPhone is something people are probably going to remember years from now
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.100]   in the way people remember like a techniques 1200 turntable or something.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:24.580]   They're just going to go, yeah, that was, that's, you know, or like a, what, like, you
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.420]   know, like a Braun product or, you know, Tita Rams kind of thing.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:31.140]   You're going to look at this and go, this was really, they got most of the parts of
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.340]   this really, really, really good.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.900]   And now the challenge is like you say with the problem is that seven and seven inch screen
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.180]   thing, I don't know the first thing about that tablet, any of these tablets, but it
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.260]   kind of feels like it's neither fish nor foul.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.980]   Like when I keep annoyingly asking you what you use it for, like specifically, like for
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.460]   me, there's stuff I love the iPad.
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.260]   I think it's brilliant, but there's some stuff I would never in a million years try to do
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.500]   on the iPad as I think everybody should not try to do.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.980]   And I just wonder, where does it, where do you think it excels at this tablet in general
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:07.100]   and specifically excels on the kind of light, the tweeting stuff, social networking, email
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.100]   and calendar, and that kind of stuff?
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.580]   What would you not do on the seven inch?
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.580]   If I could ask?
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.580]   I think that might do it on iPad.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.580]   It's your my turn on iPad.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.580]   I directed it.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   Go ahead.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580]   No, no, no.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   Go ahead.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:26.540]   The I really, my interaction with the seven inch tablet is a larger, more comfortable version
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.420]   of the sort of apps that I would have in my pocket.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.380]   There is definitely a difference between having a big, big tenant screen like you have on
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.780]   the iPad, a big keyboard that you can actually touch type on and actually type 40 to 50
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.780]   words per minute on.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.780]   That's the big one.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.780]   That's a keyboard.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.660]   And having just more real estate, more luxury, so to speak, in the user interface and just
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.660]   having that larger screen.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.980]   I have to be quite happy with the seven inch.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:49.980]   I don't notice it that much more portable.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.980]   I'll give you an example.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.180]   I've played Angry Birds on all three sizes.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.180]   The Angry Birds test.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.100]   This is the key test to understand whether these devices are really good work.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.100]   It looks great for gaming.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.860]   It's a perfect size for gaming.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.460]   It's funny of space for that.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.700]   I think the keyboard is the biggest difference.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.420]   You wouldn't want to do word processing for any length of time on.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.780]   But I wouldn't want to do that on the iPad either.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:12.500]   But I can see people saying that works and it's true that it's key is at least are big
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.780]   enough that you know, you find them to be too big like on the iPad.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.780]   That's exactly right.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.500]   They're actually too far apart.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:25.300]   I think Andy said this in one of his 60 Kajillion word wonderful iPad post from the week he
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.100]   posted 50 million words about the iPad.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.100]   So good.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.740]   I run into this thing because I'm lazy.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.220]   I like to be seated and maybe even recline a little bit.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.100]   So I'll go and I'll sit somewhere when I'm back against a wall, put that thing in my
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.300]   lap.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.180]   And I have still not found a position where I can type without.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.300]   Let me show you those interesting that our coach is doing on a table.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.300]   Yes.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.900]   Let me show you something interesting that our coach is doing though.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.100]   They do have the seven inch and I'm not sure the price is on this.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.900]   But I'm sure it will be less than the Samsung Galaxy S and the big difference will be it
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.820]   won't be tied to a carrier, which is a big problem with the Galaxy S because you have
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.820]   to buy it.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:01.820]   Well, I guess you can.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.780]   You know, you can buy it for 600 without a carrier.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   I don't know.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.100]   I don't know then what you would do with it.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.860]   They also offer this is the same size as a droid X.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.540]   This is a four inch and then this is the one I found the most intriguing.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.540]   This is about the size of an iPod touch.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.700]   It's running an ARM processor.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.380]   Unfortunately, the batteries died on all these because I left them here.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   No, maybe not.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.580]   I left them here for three days and I didn't charge them and I should have.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:30.060]   But this is it is a resistant resistant screen that I found to be very usable.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.060]   $99.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.220]   Wow.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.060]   So that's I wish I could.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.300]   Yeah, I think the batteries died on it.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.740]   It really is a interesting product.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:43.660]   Now, our coach I've kind of written off because in the past they've their operating system
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.940]   has been kind of clunky.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.140]   But if they start really focusing on Android, I think these devices are going to be very
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.140]   interesting.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.740]   It's a good this is as a $99 product.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.540]   This is an interesting product to compete with a iPod touch, for instance.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.540]   That's absolutely true.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:04.020]   The only worry that you have with Android is realize that if Google comes out with 2.2,
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:09.860]   3.0, 3.2, you have to still have to rely on ARCOs or the that's specific manufacturer
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.900]   coming up with a build of Google, excuse me, of Android that's going to be compatible
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:14.900]   with it.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.020]   Otherwise, I like ARCOs and stuff.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:22.100]   I was pretty surprised that they're still shipping a lot of devices with Android 1.6,
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:26.300]   even when 2.0 was pretty much in the bag and appearing on just by everybody.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:32.420]   Yeah, this is this is I'm now seeing this is not 2.2 the other two, the four and the seven
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   are 2.2.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.700]   I think that's an interesting question.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.700]   I don't know how they're going to.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.500]   I do love the fact that that Android has excuse me, that Google has put together a really
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.940]   good mobile operating system for free that people that other companies, hardware and
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:51.860]   software manufacturers can then take and improve on their own.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:57.460]   I think that the right mindset is that this is that Android is to these devices the way
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.100]   that Unix is to Mac OS 10.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.980]   It's just the starting point that they used to build their own operating system, their
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:04.980]   own interface.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.980]   Exactly.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:12.700]   I interviewed yesterday, Leo, I was downtown and a long story short, I needed a micro USB
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   to USB cable.
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.860]   This is a fascinating story.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.460]   So I stuck my head and just jumped into actually a T-Mobile store and there was a dude in there
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:24.460]   with an iPhone and a long story short, the guy's got an unlocked iPhone and the guy was
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.260]   like, "Oh, you know, if you use this, you can only have edge."
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.260]   I couldn't help myself.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.460]   I said to the guy, "Wow, that's what are you going to use?"
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.260]   He popped out his Android phone and I'm like, "Oh, so you tether.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:38.460]   You tether to the Android."
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.660]   Yeah, using Wi-Fi.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:44.660]   How cheap, what's the basic plan you could get to have tethering?
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.660]   20.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.900]   And what's the data plan like?
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.020]   But you still have to have the other data plan.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.220]   My Dron X does tethering.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.220]   It's $20 additional.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.180]   I think $30 for the data plan.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.740]   So it's $50 total plus you've got the phone.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.220]   I don't, you know, it's fairly horrible.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.900]   So the Wi-Fi ends up being not such a bad deal, huh?
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.900]   Well, if you just want tethering.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.220]   It depends on how much data you use to because if you go over the Wi-Fi, you just get packed
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.220]   and pounded on the data, you get...
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   Really?
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.140]   I have a $600 bill to prove that.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.140]   Really?
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:18.140]   And so you get, it's like $50 a gig after the first, after that.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.740]   And it's much less on the iPhone tethering.
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:21.740]   So it's actually...
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.740]   And getting that, getting that.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.740]   Okay.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.740]   You know, excuse me.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:30.180]   By the way, this seven inch Android, I mean, based Arco 7, eight gigabytes, take a guess.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.420]   Price on Amazon.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.420]   $249.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.420]   $187.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.420]   There you go.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.380]   Now that's Wi-Fi, no 3G.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.780]   But again, then you use tethering with something else and you've got something.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.940]   And you can get the Kindle app on it.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.940]   So there it is.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:45.940]   It's an alternative.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.620]   It's sort of a color touch screen alternative to the 180...
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.620]   No, it's $139.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.620]   That's a workable price.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.620]   That's a workable price.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.620]   It's $187.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.340]   And this is, by the way, capacitance.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.340]   This is not resistant.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.420]   It feels a little bit like the early 90s when...
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.380]   Remember, like if you wanted to have, even before the Palm, if you wanted to have what
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.380]   did they call it?
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   Like there's that episode of Seinfeld.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.420]   Remember where the guys got the little pocket?
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.220]   If you wanted a little carry around thing...
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.220]   European carry-all, yeah.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.220]   No, no, no.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.140]   But if you wanted to have like a thing with your addresses and stuff in it for a while,
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:16.140]   it was super costly.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.140]   It was only like calculators.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.140]   Right.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.140]   And suddenly it just like bam.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.900]   It was like nine bucks if you wanted one of those.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.900]   You know?
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.700]   I wonder if something similar is happening here.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.060]   These are very compelling gaming devices at seven inches.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:34.380]   You know, I'd be a little nervous if I were Nintendo DS or even, you know, PlayStation.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   Well, I guess...
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.380]   Are you drunk right now, Leo?
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.180]   You seem like you got some problems.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.100]   I'm doing this like ginger rogers backwards and upside down.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100]   But...
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100]   And he has...
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.100]   And high heels.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.340]   Well, I wasn't going to mention that.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.980]   But you know, this is for 187 bucks, folks.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.540]   And it runs Android software.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.860]   You know, this is 2.2, I believe.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.860]   So...
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.740]   What I think also here to building custom stuff, one of the problems again is that it's very...
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.900]   It's much easier to develop the custom stuff that you might want to do.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   I have my...
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.900]   That's a good point.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.900]   You know, hardware and bass is so important.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900]   So I want to build...
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.300]   Like one of the things that like the Holy Grail for me is a good...
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.500]   Like something that I'll control my Canon camera and that I can plug into.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.300]   But dealing with the hardware issues about hardware interfacing...
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.300]   Android 2.1, actually.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   It's just painful.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.140]   With the iPhone or the iPad.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.460]   But this would be something that would be more...
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.420]   It would be easier to develop for.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.420]   I would be not...
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.180]   I wouldn't be surprised if our cost made these available.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.420]   Let me see if I can update this.
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.420]   This is an interesting point.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420]   But you're saying...
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.900]   You're saying like in vertical markets, like if you wanted to go develop a dongle or a
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.900]   piece of hard...
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.900]   Right.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:40.460]   Because I think that there's a huge market for the iPad and the iPhone of being controllers
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.660]   for the rest of our life.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.660]   You know, like controllers for our oven and our microwave and our TV and everything else
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:49.340]   where we just have an interface to everything that runs through.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.340]   Like I want...
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.300]   Oxybox, Google TV, all Usand have Android apps for remote controls.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.300]   It's kind of an interesting...
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.300]   And I want to like when I go into my CRV...
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   It's not your own.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.020]   My CRV has a really bad GPS that I...
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.180]   You know, it's fine to have it in there.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.780]   But I would much prefer to have just people to pop my iPad in there and just have it run
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780]   the car.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:07.780]   I agree.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.980]   I mean, run all the media stuff for the car.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:14.300]   And so the idea of that is really interesting except for the fact that dealing with the hardware
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.620]   requirements and all the stuff that has to happen with Apple to do that really takes
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.620]   a lot of the fun.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.580]   Can I ask a dumb guy question?
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.380]   As like all my questions.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:29.020]   So the perception that with a lot of people is that one reason that Windows, it's hard
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.580]   to innovate with Windows.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.860]   One reason Windows...
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.620]   It's just tough to work with is there's a number of people throw around about, you
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.580]   know, what is it like 27 kinds of devices or whatever it is that people say, well, you
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.980]   know, there's such an installed base issue with Windows of having to support all this
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:46.780]   stuff, legacy versions of this stuff.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.660]   Is that a risk at all for Android?
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.660]   I ask this...
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.860]   Well, that's exactly what's going on with Android.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:51.860]   Do you have all these different devices?
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.340]   I think it's actually worse with Android.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.580]   I mean, it's becoming worse because it wasn't really running with it.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.580]   It's advantage, though.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.100]   I mean, it's advantage, but I think that you get to a point where there's a lot of confusion.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.100]   Someone just can't quite figure out what...
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.100]   Because I see that.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.300]   I don't know if it's that confusing.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.860]   I think developers are able to develop for this and get, you know, pretty good get on
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.860]   most...
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.500]   And this is what Eric Schmidt was asked by the way at Web 2.0.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.940]   And he said, "No, we feel like you could develop for, you know, one version that will
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.940]   play on all of them."
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.380]   That's where I was really blown away, in fact, by these seven-inch displays because I was
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.620]   told, "Oh no, stuff's not going to scale well."
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.500]   And for the most part, it scales very well.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.980]   I'm surprisingly well, son.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.980]   There was a great article a couple of years ago from one of the, I want to say, designers
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:31.620]   that worked on the redesign of Wells Fargo's software for their ATMs.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:36.980]   And this is mostly metaphorical in this instance, but, you know, you say to somebody, "Okay,
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.500]   well, you know how it isn't designed, right?
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   Oh, it's all easy.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]   It's all just bits and bytes.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   We're going to hire you, go out, redesign."
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.460]   Well, what they discovered in their kind of discovery and requirements process was that
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.020]   there's actually a astounding number of differences.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:52.020]   If you think about every kind of ATM you go to, right, there's some where there's hardware
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.100]   buttons, there's some where there's software buttons.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:00.460]   And it was out of scope to replace the hardware, but they were expected to present a unified
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.420]   interface that would work on all of these things.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:07.100]   So I thought it was such a, it made me really think about this kind of issue because they
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.540]   had to be really innovative.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.260]   And again, it's all got to be the same code base, right?
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:15.300]   You can't just have a million different, on maintainable versions.
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.740]   And I just, I wonder at what point, what do you do?
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.740]   Do you have four get?
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.740]   Do you have two versions?
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.780]   Do you have like a whatever CE or whatever?
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.780]   I mean, what do you do to keep that sustainable over time?
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:29.140]   Well, the problem with Android is you've got the, this is a trick play.
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.980]   Ha ha ha, he fooled ya.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.700]   He walked through the line.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:33.700]   They were on what?
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.700]   A bootleg?
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.700]   Yeah, it was cute.
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.700]   He has a suspicious hump of alignment.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.700]   He walked for the line.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.700]   Or the line.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.700]   Yeah, that was actually very fun.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.700]   I'm sorry, I mean, I'm trying to turn it upside down.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.700]   I'm trying to turn it upside down.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.740]   Party tells you's running.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.060]   That's something I noticed when I had it.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.060]   It doesn't.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.060]   Hm.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.380]   And then, take it, take it, take it, take it.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.380]   Well, that's YouTube.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.380]   It might be the YouTube app.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.380]   I don't know.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.380]   It's whatever it's going to be.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.380]   That's the little Benny Hill moment, little Benny Hill moment.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:04.420]   I'll be the Apple guy for just half a second and just say, I think the stupid stuff like
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.020]   that that nobody cares about, like the fact that the screen turns around, the integration.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.020]   For suckers like me.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.020]   It does turn around.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   I don't know why I did that.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.580]   Well, I'm not trying to be petty.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:17.340]   I'm just saying that for me, that fit and finish stuff is why I pay all this crappy,
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:20.340]   dumb money to Apple is, you know, and again, like my key one.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.940]   Tell me that this is not responsive.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.140]   I don't understand why people say this.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.140]   Sorry.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.060]   I'm thinking, for example, my G1, maybe this is a bad example.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:35.180]   When I got that G1, the second software upgrade, I think, I can't remember specifically, but
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.380]   basically it just wouldn't work on the phone.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.660]   So the phone became like an interesting thing.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.300]   Yeah, well, the G1, I agree.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.940]   But yeah, anyway, I guess I'm just bringing it up because it's interesting to me that
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.980]   $187 versus a $500.
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.980]   I pad.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.980]   That's a $300.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.980]   No, I know.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.980]   I'm not talking to you particularly, Merle.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.380]   I'm just saying that's a $300 differential.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.380]   I don't know.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.580]   I think this has a Kindle app on it.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:07.380]   You know, I think I have a good point there.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:11.700]   The price really, it really isn't such an important component of the feature of any device.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.940]   There's so many times I'm looking at something and I'm like, but when I reviewed the first
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.940]   MacBook Air, I thought that this would be an exception.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.300]   It's a very traditionally good $1,000 computer for an $1,800 computer, no way.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.860]   And so that's often what I think about when I see a lot of these lesser Android devices,
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:33.460]   where if you're trying to get 500 bucks out of me for this, no, but for $189, sure.
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.500]   I'm willing to do it.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.900]   I think that side by side, you can demonstrate that there are a lot of things in which it's
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.620]   not quite as polished as an iPad, but the answer to the next question is 300 bucks less.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.460]   No matter what the next question is, the answer is it's 300 bucks less.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:50.860]   The reality is I'm not going to, I cook a lot with Epicurious on my iPad.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860]   This would be perfect for that.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:56.860]   And so I don't, I don't, that would not be a sole use for my iPad in my kitchen at $500,
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:02.020]   $800, but at $187 and a little, a little something that would attach to something that I could
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:07.740]   roll down, I do it often enough that it would be worth, you know, to me it'd be worth actually
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:11.620]   getting one just for the kitchen, just for watching videos while I'm doing stuff and
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.460]   so on and so forth.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.340]   We're seeing that this is not the same model.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.100]   So I may be wrong on the price.
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.780]   What's the, I don't understand.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.380]   This is the seven.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.540]   Am I doing something wrong?
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.500]   It looks like the same.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.500]   Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.300]   It's a, it's the Arco seven IS.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.260]   Maybe you have the Arco seven enterprise.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:36.060]   Oh, maybe this is the studio of CS different.
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:43.020]   Well, I'm maybe maybe with more memory.
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.620]   They do, you know, they do make this, I don't know.
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.020]   This looks like the one.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.820]   I'm sorry, but I don't know.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.420]   If there's a difference, I apologize if I got the price right.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.980]   Do you guys ever see Marco's post from a few, Marco had a really good post, Marco.org had
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.420]   a good post a few months ago that I don't know.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.340]   They're not selling you to Amazon.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.340]   Okay.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.900]   It basically was saying like, well, you know, here's what phones look like before the iPhone
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.900]   came out.
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.140]   And truly he was like, Oh, there's a trio.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.980]   You know, here's a, and then like a few months after the iPhone came out.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.580]   Here's what phones look like and like every single one of them look like an iPhone.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.580]   Okay.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.780]   Now tablets, Apple can't make a tablet bad, bad, bad, blah.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.420]   And, and here's what tablets look like before then.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:25.300]   And it was, it's just such a great post because it's almost like the, you know, the way the
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.940]   daily show, you know, so much TV news acts like we can't find video of how somebody's
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:34.420]   live and Marco just takes out actual photos of popular devices.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:38.660]   It's, it's astounding how much they make a 10 as well.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.820]   And the two seven, two 79.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.220]   The list is two 79.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.780]   So the list on Amazon is 200.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.780]   So 70 bucks more.
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:49.500]   I mean, I think it's still probably, and by the way, you can get it loaded with up to
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.420]   250 gigs of memory.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:58.060]   If you'd like who should buy the seven inch arc goes rather than a low end.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.220]   You can live with Android.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.620]   I think would be start step one.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:01.620]   I mean, that's the biggest case.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.620]   You use case.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.100]   What would you see that being better for somebody who wants the portability?
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.100]   Obviously, right?
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.700]   You know what I really liked about the Samsung and I would guess is the same in the arc
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:11.420]   coast, but maybe not because the Samsung has such a good screen.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.460]   This is Kindle sized.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.620]   So anybody who says, oh, the iPad's too big to read.
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:18.060]   I want something Kindle sized.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.060]   This is Kindle sized and a very good book reading.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.220]   I think it's just yeah, that's that's that's what I was going to say.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:29.660]   I think if if I have to come up with one sentence to describe why this one would want to buy
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:34.220]   by the seven inch tablet, it would be if you if you want a phone that's also a really
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:38.180]   good book reader, because a lot of people will never be able to connect to the smaller
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.860]   screen when reading books.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:44.380]   I do still think that the iPad is the best book reader you can get, but in terms of comfort
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.820]   of reading, but you really want that larger screen.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:52.420]   And I still I still think that Android is more geared towards the geek than than the
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.420]   iPhone is or the iPad.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.180]   I mean, I think that if I if my parents ask, what should I get?
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:00.580]   I still would not necessarily recommend an Android an Android device.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.620]   You know, I just I just I just agree with you guys, but that's just me.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.100]   I'm I'll just be the lone to center.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.700]   I know it's an Apple show and I'm going to get a lot of hate mail for people saying you
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.100]   shouldn't be on an Apple show if you prefer.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:13.300]   I don't think we're out because I want to actually I'm actually looking at it.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.260]   I mean, for me, I actually want to get an Arco 70 to do a bunch of you know, there's
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.260]   a bunch of things that I went to.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.260]   I'm not saying that I don't like it.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.500]   I just say that when I think about my parents, if you're not a geek, you should get a Windows
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.500]   phone.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.500]   There you go.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.100]   Talk about throwing a hand grenade.
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:29.340]   Well, they see well, they've they've they've they've racked up a lot of really big wins
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.420]   over the past couple of weeks.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.860]   Now every a lot of the if there was a list of 10 apps that you would commercial apps off
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:40.220]   of the iPad or off of off the iPhone or off Android device you would want to have in
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.420]   any phone.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.180]   They've got now about four or five of them.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.180]   They have the Kindle app.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.180]   They've got not auditioned.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:48.180]   Not audible yet.
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.180]   Soon, I hope the eBay.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:54.580]   I'm sure it's coming that whatever it is who's who's essentially keeping the developer community
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.660]   staffed with beer and hookers.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:00.940]   He's definitely he's definitely working that expense account because name after it seems
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.820]   like every four days, I'll get another press release from another company that said, okay,
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.380]   we're doing where you were bringing our our industry standard Netflix app or industry
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:16.300]   standard Hulu app or industry standard to Windows Windows mobile phone personal seven
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.780]   phone system seven phone platform.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:22.020]   And that is by the way, the one of these days, I won't learn what they are.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:24.780]   One of the issues, Windows phone seven, I know it's ridiculous.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.580]   One of the issues and Netflix will not go on Android because they say it's not secure,
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.340]   but they're glad to go on iPhone and Windows phones.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.340]   Yes.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.140]   There's a name for this phenomenon.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.580]   There probably is somewhere, but there's a phenomenon I think everybody's familiar with
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.580]   where you go.
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.580]   Okay.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.940]   Everybody, be honest, be super honest.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:45.220]   First time you open up a new search engine.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.500]   What's that cool new one with the slash tags?
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.500]   Grokle or suckle or bickle or whatever.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.500]   You open up a new search engine.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.460]   What's the first thing you search for?
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.460]   Your name, right?
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:55.460]   Exactly.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.340]   And you're going to immediately.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.580]   This is such a lizard brain thing, but be honest, right?
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:03.100]   Your first reaction is going to be, "How well you like the results for your name?"
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.500]   You go to a new music service like RDIO, radio or whatever.
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.700]   I subscribed for a few months.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:11.020]   It just wasn't my style, but I think it's definitely Alex's style.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.420]   Have you played with radio Alex?
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   I have not.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.420]   Oh, God.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.420]   You need to be honest.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.420]   You need so need to be honest.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:17.500]   It's a beautiful service.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.620]   I picked it, but they all mocked me when I picked it.
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:20.620]   So that's okay.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.620]   You know, I...
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.860]   But you go in and I did a search on not the long winners, but one of my favorite bands,
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:27.580]   maybe Sloane, I did a quick search and they weren't on there.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   So despite the gajillions of stuff, I went on to the...
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:32.020]   Gosh, I shouldn't say this.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.740]   Sloane, is that your...
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.900]   I searched for Oliver de Kudzi.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.900]   Like, that's like literally...
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:37.900]   Literally.
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:38.900]   I go to a music thing.
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:39.900]   No, yeah.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.900]   He's actually on a lot of things.
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:41.900]   He's part of...
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.900]   I don't know that.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:43.900]   Oliver de Kudzi, though.
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.540]   I always go, "It's M de Kudzi."
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.540]   He plays...
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.540]   No, no, no.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.940]   He's African, but it's a band out of Zimbabwe.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:50.940]   Fantastic.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.700]   And if anyone's listening to Koo music, that's the one you want.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.940]   But if I find Tooko music, then it's going to...
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.100]   We're okay.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.020]   So just underscore your point.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.340]   If you go to that store and you go Angry Birds or whatever your obsession is, you're
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.340]   going to go...
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.700]   I guess what I'm trying to say is there's a really disproportionate advantage that
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.340]   it gives when the app that you look for does come up.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.860]   Well, that's the whole thing about that.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.980]   That's the whole issue of 300,000 apps or it's the whole issue of going to a record store
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:17.620]   that has more than just the top 40.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:21.340]   Even though the top 40 is what 90% of what they sell, if you walk in and can't find it,
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.020]   you'd make a decision that you can't buy anything there again.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.900]   There's poor little camera shot that's down the street from us here.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:32.620]   You know, I go in and 80% of the time they don't have what I need.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.500]   And so most of the time I don't even consider them anymore.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.500]   I just order stuff on Amazon.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.540]   It's great for filters, but you're not going to buy a lens there.
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:44.700]   Can I tell you one type of tablet you are not going to buy is a Windows-based tablet.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:50.220]   HP made 5,000 HP slates and ooh, demand was twice what they thought.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.380]   They sold 9,000 of them.
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:55.380]   And the Crunchpad.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.620]   Yes, that's true.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.180]   Ow.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:07.140]   Now considering Apple sells 46,555 iPads a day, it's not probably anything to jump up and
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.300]   down a bit.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.140]   But I do think I'll be curious to see what the price are.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.140]   But what's the price?
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:12.140]   I'm the HP.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   I don't know.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.460]   I'd be curious to see what the figures are for Android.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.380]   I still think currently anything over $400 starts to become no man's land.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.380]   I think it was.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.380]   It was over that.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.380]   All the stuff living in the $250, $800.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.540]   Yeah, once you go into that, now you're going head to head.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.860]   And I think that's a real...
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.860]   That's a real...
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.820]   It wasn't the 7-inch screen.
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:32.980]   It might have been the price.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:33.980]   It might have been Windows.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.420]   I think you have to have an OS designed for touch.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.460]   And I think that's why Android can at least compete.
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.740]   You got to knock it out of the park over $400 in my opinion.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.740]   I mean, you know, it's just...
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.740]   Because you're beating its computers is your point.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:47.740]   Well, I'll talk about that.
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.740]   Hey, will Steve Jobs be the man of the year?
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:53.140]   He's a mayor of Google, says he should be.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.140]   Wow.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:56.820]   Time magazine's Man of the Year Online voting has begun.
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:00.900]   And currently the premiere of Turkey is way ahead.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.900]   Apparently, there's a big Turkish internet contingent.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.980]   But Steve Jobs is in the realm.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.620]   Oh, no, it's not that again.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:10.100]   Yeah, it's, you know, maybe 4chan decided to vote.
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.100]   I don't know.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.860]   Let me see.
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:20.660]   I'll just get the latest time.com has, you know, I don't, they don't, by the way, this
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:25.620]   doesn't mean that this is who it'll be because Times editors choose the person of the year.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.620]   This is just a suggestion.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.620]   This is just a serving suggestion.
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:31.380]   This is just a bald attempt to get traffic.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.100]   Okay, let's face it.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.100]   It's true.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:37.300]   And they've certainly got the Turkish vote.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.300]   You know, now I can't even...
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.300]   You want to get that.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.420]   You really want to get deep, deep, deep into that Turkish vertical.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.100]   You don't want to leave that to Amazon.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.740]   Time magazine.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.620]   And Thanksgiving is right around the corner, so.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.620]   Do we agree?
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.700]   I mean, I think Jobs certainly had a good year.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700]   You did?
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:56.260]   I mean, the iPad isn't the iPad the most isn't statistically, then they say it's the most
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.620]   the fastest selling electronic device ever.
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.620]   No.
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:01.620]   That's really something.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:02.620]   Is that right?
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.980]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.980]   Wow.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.380]   Last year, the person of the year, who was, do we even remember?
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.380]   No.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.380]   No.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:16.380]   It's the F. Murray Abraham syndrome.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.740]   You won an Oscar?
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.060]   And then you never hear from him again for the next three, four years.
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.700]   Look at Vincent Chivelli.
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.700]   Oh.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.340]   Yeah, I was about to say.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.340]   Exactly.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.340]   Good point.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.340]   Can I not look at him?
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.340]   I love that guy.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.340]   Funny looking.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   He's the Marty Feldman of Toronto.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.740]   We get real much formant puts him in every movie, right?
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.540]   He's in every realish formant movie.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:36.540]   Right.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.740]   Well, last year I think it was Ben Bernanke.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.660]   Well, I have a list now.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:47.380]   Every time magazine, Man of the Year and Ben Bernanke, you're right.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.380]   Wow.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:49.380]   That's cool.
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.180]   We can now call it the F. Murray Bernanke syndrome.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.900]   There you have it.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.020]   Barack Obama, before that, Vladimir Putin.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:57.220]   In 2006, remember, it was you.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   Sweet.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.220]   Sweet.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.220]   Thank you.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:07.340]   Bill Melinda Gates and Bono in 2005, George W. Bush, 2004, the American soldier in 2003.
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:11.980]   Some were saying the votes are coming in for the unemployed American for this year.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   Mm.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:16.700]   I sure do like populism, don't y'all?
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:21.740]   I appreciate that, but doesn't it feel like a cheat when they said the winner, the greatest
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740]   man in the world is you.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.740]   Love is enough, person.
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:26.740]   Love.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:30.540]   What are you talking about love?
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.460]   Everyone's narcissistic, but you.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:35.580]   1938, it was Adolf Hitler, just, just, just all in perspective.
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:36.580]   It should be.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.580]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.060]   That's what people lose track of, is that it used to mean something.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.620]   It used to mean the person that had the biggest impact on the world.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.620]   Right.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   And you know what?
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:45.860]   The biggest person that having impact on the world was not you.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:46.860]   Right.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.860]   No, it wasn't.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.420]   1939, it was Stalin.
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.780]   In 1940, it was Churchill, then Roosevelt, then Stalin again.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:55.780]   In '93.
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:57.420]   He's a one-all Harrison.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.940]   One of the, one of the few two timers, Elizabeth, the, Elizabeth II won in 1952.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.220]   She's been around a while.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:08.340]   Jimmy Carter is 76 on "Warsedot" and 77.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.700]   Why am I wasting your time with this?
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:10.700]   Let's move on.
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.300]   I think that's interesting, and that's why I'm glad to have on the show.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.780]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:17.460]   You know who was in 2002?
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.460]   The Whistleblowers.
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.460]   Wow.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:23.180]   Was that, is that the guys who opened for the Proclaimers?
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.180]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.380]   Well, I could walk five, five hundred.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.180]   I, I, I, I.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.940]   No, the Whistleblowers are the ones that stopped them from.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:33.940]   It is in a Mac break weekly, unless we've sung "I Could Walk 500 Miles."
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.100]   Now we have, I think it's time for a break.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:41.340]   When we return your picks of the week, gentlemen, but first I have to tell you, and I would love
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:45.820]   to tell you about Gazelle, we all have old stuff lying around.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.380]   The household gadgets, old things that we no longer need.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.060]   Gazelle is what you do when you got that stuff.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.660]   You call up, actually you don't even have to call them.
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.980]   You can go to the Gazelle site.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.980]   That's what I do.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:00.220]   Go to Gazelle.com and enter in what your gadgets are.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.220]   Get a box.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.220]   Throw them all in the box.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.220]   Gazelle will send you a mailing labor.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.820]   They pay, label, they pay for postage.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:09.300]   And then they send you a check.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.300]   It couldn't be easier.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:15.180]   I get tweeted, recently I just got tweeted from somebody who said, "I love Gazelle.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:19.260]   I, I, I filled it out, told them what my iPhone was, and they sent me more money."
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.260]   Because they said, you know what?
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.700]   It's in better condition than you said it was.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:29.300]   If you enter in your device here at Gazelle, gazelle.com, I like to do the iPhone because
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.300]   everybody's got an old 3GS lying around, right?
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.420]   You just would love to get a 4.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.620]   And maybe you've put, maybe you've put iOS 4.0 on your 3GS and now you can't wait to
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:40.940]   get rid of it.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.820]   So you, you click the item and you say, "Does it make a call?"
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.820]   "Yes.
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:46.820]   Is it free of water damage?"
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:47.820]   "Yes."
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:48.820]   It's in, let's say good condition.
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:49.820]   Maybe I scratched it up a little bit.
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.660]   I do have the original cables and AC adapter.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.340]   You can see the price has been tumbling on a 3G.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:56.020]   This is a 3G, an 8 gigabyte 3G.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.260]   How much is that worth?
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.260]   71 bucks.
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:01.340]   Hey, that's something you'd get that you wouldn't get it otherwise.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:07.780]   Occasionally about 10% of the things Gazelle gets, you can't sell because they're just
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:08.900]   too crappy.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.300]   They have great recycling too.
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:13.180]   It's a great way to recycle your electronics.
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:16.260]   They use EPA-certified recyclers.
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:19.940]   They guarantee no landfill.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.660]   So this is a, this is a really, they don't send it to China.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:25.660]   Proper recycling.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.340]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:34.460]   So fill that out, get all your stuff, and then at the very end, when you're checking out,
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.380]   enter the offer code MAC break and they'll give you a bonus 5%.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.540]   20 product categories, 200,000 unique items.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:42.540]   Great for charities too.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.540]   You can have a Gazelle gadget drive.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:45.540]   G-A-Z-E-L-E.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:46.540]   Don't sell it.
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:47.540]   Gazelle it.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:49.020]   We're big fans here.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.020]   We use Gazelle a lot.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.540]   Merlin, you haven't been here in a long time.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:53.860]   Well, a couple of weeks anyway.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860]   Do you have a pick?
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.860]   I'll let you start today.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:02.460]   Well, in my ongoing drive to become relevant, I'm just going to mention something I like
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:08.300]   a lot with the disclosure that my friend Adam did the promotional video for these guys
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.980]   and I got this free.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.460]   But JOBBON sandwich.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.740]   The only sandwich, that's right.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:18.500]   JOBBON, the people who make the Bluetooth things, just put out something called the Jambox.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.660]   And they sent me one for free that I love.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.380]   And I just want to say it's worth checking out.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.380]   It's really cool.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:24.380]   Jambox.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.820]   First of all, if you haven't seen Adam's video for this, it's just worth watching the video.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:27.820]   Because it's insane.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:28.820]   Adam, this guy?
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:35.380]   No, that guy's actually, he's a performer and he's, I really want this guy's head more
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.380]   than anything in the world.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.940]   This guy, he's got to kind of cause the kid's head that I really envy.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.500]   So the Jambox is a little red plastic brick.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.460]   The Jambox is, well, to describe it to folks who can't see the video, it's larger than
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.460]   a candy bar.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:54.180]   But it's basically a rubberized little box with cool speakers in it.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.740]   Oh, it's a speaker.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:59.180]   But it also does speakerphone.
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.980]   And it works with multiple Bluetooth devices.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:01.980]   Your phone can ring.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.980]   It does color ID.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:06.620]   Essentially, if you just imagine Bluetooth speakers, I think done right.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:07.620]   I like it a lot.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:12.460]   It's got a micro USB in that lets you interact with their website to add new voices and
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.460]   apps.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.460]   So how's the sound on it?
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:16.060]   Well, I'm not an audio file.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.220]   I stood in front of an orange amp for five years.
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.220]   So I'm mostly deaf.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.100]   I think it sounds fricking great.
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.100]   I like it a lot.
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:23.260]   It's super portable.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:24.980]   You could use it for conference calling a bit.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   It's a couple hundred bucks.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.980]   It's not cheap.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.740]   But I liked it a lot.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.740]   And I'm loving it.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.740]   I'm using it.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:31.740]   I'm using one right now.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.380]   Got a line out or excuse me, a line in.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.980]   So if you, so you can just leave it plugged in through the micro USB if you just want
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.420]   to use it as a thing.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:41.260]   But it's got pretty good battery life.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:44.700]   I have a pretty English lady voice on there that tells me when the battery is running
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:45.700]   low.
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.180]   Anyway, that's my pseudo Mac-esque thing.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.180]   It's the Jambox.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.180]   Keep one of the called Jobbox, which is an awesome band.
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:54.660]   But it's actually the JobBone Jambox.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.740]   And if you Google that, you can check out Adam's video.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:58.740]   It's a great demo of it.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.340]   I like it a lot.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:05.180]   My suggestion though, at the risk of opening a rat hole is something related to the Beatles
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.940]   with whom I am obsessed.
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:09.780]   And this is available for streaming on Netflix.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.780]   I don't know.
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.780]   I haven't seen it too many other places.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.660]   Gosh, the reviews on this are not good on Netflix.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.660]   But I love this.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:21.340]   It's a film showing to our movie called Documentary called Composing the Beatles Songbook.
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:26.780]   And I consider myself like, I'm not like a Beatles super super super fan, but I know
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.380]   a fair amount about the Beatles.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:31.940]   And I learned so much in this documentary I didn't know.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:38.620]   It is, I have to admit, agree with the viewers, like me, it's a little Paul centric.
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:40.740]   I'm a guy who thinks Paul doesn't do this.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:41.940]   I don't think Paul got his due.
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:46.020]   I think a lot of people don't realize what Paul's contribution to the music and the
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:51.820]   band writ large was, and all the times he kind of papered over for John when he was
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.340]   being John.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:58.220]   But it's a fantastic insight into how they work together through, from the beginning,
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.780]   through, you know, when they stopped working together as much.
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.380]   I thought it was a tremendous film.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.260]   I learned the one fact I'll share with you.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:05.980]   I did not know.
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:09.340]   I used to be part of the great unwashed that thought every time the Beatles did something
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:11.500]   interesting, it was John's idea.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.820]   Every time the Beatles did something avant garde, it was John.
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:19.500]   And that's just apparently simply not true, that there was a time where basically Paul
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:24.040]   was living with Jane Asher and was the cosmopolitan, go to party's guy, hang out and watch new
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.340]   wave films guy, listen to music concrete and stuff.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:31.100]   While John was sitting around in the suburbs with Cynthia, you know, being sad.
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:34.020]   And so really stuff like tomorrow never knows, I am the walrus.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:38.740]   A lot of that stuff is, and even like revolution number nine to an extent, has a huge influence
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.820]   of Paul that most people are not aware of.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:44.060]   If you're interested in all the Beatles, if you're interested in songwriting, and if you're
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:48.300]   interested in the way people collaborate and don't, and the shelf life that really any
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.460]   collaboration has, I thought it was a terrific film.
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:55.060]   They talked to a lot of insiders, a lot took a lot to class of warmen, the guy who did
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:59.540]   the cover of revolver, the guy who played ace in the plastic ono band.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:05.060]   Anyway, composing the Beatles songbook available for streaming on Netflix, presumably elsewhere,
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:05.900]   my recommendation.
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:10.940]   By the way, when you do it in the instant play is a little advantage.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:14.820]   You get some other recommendations, including a John Lennon plastic ono band, the Imagine
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:19.460]   John Lennon, John and Yoko's year of peace and Joni Mitchell, woman of heart and mind,
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:22.620]   all of which I've now added to my instant play.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.620]   My cue is ridiculous on the Tivo.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.620]   Because you know what?
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:29.540]   Can I just say one thing, Leo, still drives me crazy about bookmarks on every browser.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:35.300]   Why in bookmarks is the latest thing that you bookmark at the bottom that is completely
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.300]   insane to me.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.300]   And the same with Netflix.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.300]   When I'm on the Tivo, I have to go, "Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:41.300]   boop, boop, boop."
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:46.620]   Because I got to get past Kipper and Thomas and Dora and Kaiu to get down to the Beatles.
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.380]   Hey, yeah, I never get past Kaiu.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.380]   I just guess.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:50.380]   There's like an eternal--
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:51.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:52.380]   Kaiu is a plague in my house.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.380]   Is it French?
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.380]   No.
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:55.380]   No, he's Canadian.
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:56.380]   It's Canadian.
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:57.380]   Oh.
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:58.380]   And it's cute, but it's no dinosaur train.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.380]   Moving on.
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:00.380]   Good.
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:01.380]   Two good recommendations from Merlin Mann.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:04.100]   I'm going to give Andy Anotko the next position.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:10.220]   Well, I'm likewise going to recommend something that's Mac related because you can visit this
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:16.340]   site in a Mac browser and listen to it on Mac devices.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:21.460]   This is-- of course, Beatles were on everybody's mind yesterday, so I started looking around.
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:26.980]   I came across this great site called the Beatles Complete on Ukelele.com.
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:27.980]   This is the--
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:30.020]   This is your kind of record.
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:32.420]   Well, no, it's even better than that.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.420]   It is a project.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:34.420]   Yeah, sure.
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:38.180]   Let me read the mission statement on the site.
[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:40.460]   The Beatles Complete on Ukelele.com.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:46.860]   At www.thebeadlescompleteon.com, we will release a new recording of a different Beatles song
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.300]   featuring a different artist every Tuesday.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:54.900]   A short essay will coincide with every recording, and each performance will include a ukelele.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:58.580]   The project being had on January, it sounds almost like a threat.
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.940]   We will release a new song every week until our demands are met.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:05.620]   We're going to cut off a finger and release a ukelele song.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:12.020]   So they started this on January 20, 2009, and they're going to finish it on July 31,
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:13.660]   2012.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.820]   And you just look through this and, yes, they're damn it, they are releasing dozens and hundreds
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:19.820]   of Beatles songs.
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.100]   Nice, nice, nice versions of them.
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:28.500]   ♪ Come on, flat up, become ♪ ♪ Oh, and I'm slowly gone ♪
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.140]   This is actually good.
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:33.740]   It's hard to come together, cover.
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:35.940]   I've heard so many bad come together covers.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:41.300]   And plus, when I found this, I was expecting guys like me to do like, revolution number
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.300]   nine, like, and how can I arrange this?
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.580]   So I just need the C, the F, and the G chord and nothing tricky.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:50.060]   But you'll see ones that were just like mostly track recordings by professionals.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.060]   Diminished chords.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.060]   Well, you know how they started?
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:59.180]   Was that amazing how I guitar gently weaped Guy in Central Park, which is amazing, right?
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:02.060]   And well, I guess this is kind of following along in the spirit of that.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:03.060]   Here's Leah Segal.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.180]   Listen to the picking.
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:10.580]   ♪ Black birds singing in the dead of night ♪
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.380]   This is awesome, Andy.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.900]   Yeah, good find.
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:17.860]   ♪ And these broken wings and learned to fly ♪
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:20.380]   Good for the Beatles and the Yooka Laley.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.020]   And of course you can just, they're all MP3's.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.780]   It's on our RSS feed, so you can just download them.
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.780]   That was my desire to see to fight one Beatles song that I actually can actually learn and
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:32.780]   play.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.180]   The answer to that is no, because you know what?
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:39.100]   It's almost as if John Lennon and Paul McCartney, it's almost like they know a lot of chords
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.100]   that I don't.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.100]   Damn, then.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.100]   Damn.
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:44.100]   Well, I mean, I know I made using four strings.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.100]   I mean, come on.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.860]   Yeah, how many combinations could there be?
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.340]   But I was four times as happy to find this.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.300]   It was like, that was a waste of 90 minutes of this is a good one.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:53.300]   This is a good one.
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:54.300]   They're all so good.
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:36:00.220]   This is a good one.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:02.220]   This is a good one.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:03.380]   This is a great song.
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:08.220]   This is a great song for like when you're doing a barbecue or a party, whatever you mix
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.980]   those in because you get a bunch of people that I used to play.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.820]   So I used to be a DJ for weddings a long time ago.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820]   And I'm next.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   And I did.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.820]   I did.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.820]   I did.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.820]   I did.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:22.100]   I once played the electric slide nine times.
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.100]   The ride would come over.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   I think they're ready for it again.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.100]   I'm like, I don't think so.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.540]   Anyway, so 300 weddings later, there were certain songs that you love to put up.
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:33.180]   Like there was a Tory Amos version of smells like Teen Spirit.
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:35.100]   And it was all and you play it.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.340]   You can see people just this.
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.020]   You're not really flexible, but no, no, you do it during the dinner.
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:42.540]   Like when they're, you know, and you see this quizzical look like they're like, I recognize
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:45.820]   the song, but I don't recognize this song.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:50.540]   And so ever since then, I've loved to put these like these cool covers.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:54.620]   You know, you kind of mix them into a party mix and people, you know, just it adds a
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:56.220]   little spice to the whole thing.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:01.780]   It's a broke orchestra version of Frank Zapper's Peaches Peaches in the Gail.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:02.780]   I love that song.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:04.300]   I found that a few weeks ago.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:07.500]   And my God, it works.
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.820]   How soon are we going to see Frank Zappa on you?
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.820]   Kaleil.
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.700]   Now that yes, I'd be happy to see Frank Zappa on iTunes.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.360]   But I was, I was looking for five different tracks.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.900]   I couldn't find any of them and I just feel really as though I was unloved by God.
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:23.900]   I'm like, really?
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:26.260]   I think he has so much stuff.
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:29.100]   I think well, yes, that's part of the problem is there's a lot.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:30.340]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.540]   He's sort of put on all that live stuff too, didn't he?
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:33.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.040]   Shut up, play your guitar.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.040]   Is there a zappa?
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.340]   I mean, I know I bought there.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.140]   There's there's some zappa, but I was trying.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.620]   I was trying to, I was trying.
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.980]   I wanted to recommend one of my favorite like ripped CD tracks.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:50.500]   One of them was one of them was a specific version of Peaches and Regalia.
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.220]   That was on RICO disc.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:57.940]   Another one was this might get us the explicit tag, but there's a there's a certain, they
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:01.940]   have ends with the word tornado that, you know, that is I'm quite fond of.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.500]   That's a frank and do weasel collaboration that is not available.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:08.180]   I have to say I'm there's 49 zappa choices on Amazon.
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.300]   I'm some stuff I'd never heard of.
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.660]   So maybe maybe you might check Amazon.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.660]   I'll check.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:14.660]   I'll check again.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.260]   Boy, I mean, some of this stuff.
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.180]   Tis the season to be jelly.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.180]   Yes.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.420]   The man didn't spend a whole lot of time sitting on his hands.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:27.020]   He usually had an arm and he was used to recording when that when that happened.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.020]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.020]   Have you seen that YouTube video of when he was on Steve Allen's show as a teenager?
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.980]   A little weird.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.020]   He was weird even then.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:37.460]   He's totally gawky looking.
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.300]   Hi, there used to be a really good Peaches and Regalia from Baby Snakes.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.900]   And I think they took it down.
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:46.260]   For those of you in the audience, he might have thought you just had a stroke.
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.860]   Those were all actual words.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.980]   Look how many different Peaches and Regalia versions there are in Amazon.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:54.500]   It's almost the audio only.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.020]   Oh, I see on the Amazon.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.020]   Okay.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:59.020]   The Amazon is where you want to go.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.020]   But I mean, there's 19, but maybe not the one.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.020]   I don't know.
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.740]   That song still it's from gosh, it's from Michael in early 70s.
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:05.740]   All right.
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:06.740]   It's really old to my mother's.
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.620]   Many of these are not performed by Frank Zappa.
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.620]   Here's.
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.260]   You know, there's a little bit of do weasel pollution.
[01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:13.260]   It's for worth worth.
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.660]   He's a great guy, but there's he's one of the research on zappa and there's so much
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.300]   do weasel doing Frank Zappa.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.660]   He's the one touring with the zappa.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:21.660]   Excuse me.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:22.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:28.100]   I think Oregon, Oregon, Oregon, Nissimo, their version of Peaches and Regalia must be considered
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.100]   something.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.260]   I don't know what.
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:33.100]   Let's get, let's get your pick.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:36.700]   Why don't we and move on here, Alex Lindsay zappa pick of the week.
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:37.700]   All right.
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:39.940]   So I have, I have, I have two picks.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.140]   One is the first one is talking Tom.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.140]   Have you seen talking Tom?
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:43.140]   Yeah, for kids.
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.380]   Some kid put it on my iPad.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:46.380]   It's pretty fun.
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.380]   Wait, hold on.
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:48.380]   Kind of end this out.
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.380]   I have all of these.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:51.340]   My son really enjoys this one.
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.340]   So you talk into it.
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.340]   It's a kitty cat.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.340]   You talk into it.
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:58.620]   Oh, it's like Carl kind of my son really enjoys this.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.940]   It's your audience way low.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:00.940]   Hold on.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:01.940]   Shh.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:07.900]   This is Mac break.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:08.900]   This is Mac break.
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.140]   This is Mac break.
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.860]   It's all it does.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:12.860]   Howers of fun.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   I'm just telling you.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.020]   My daughter loves talking Carl.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:16.020]   You poke me in the eye.
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:17.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.020]   And there's all these little things you can do with my son.
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.180]   You know, you can tell when he, you know, you can hear it now.
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:23.380]   And so I, I, I, I can hear the, him changing.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.380]   It's like this crazy 80D thing with, with the phone where he's changing.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:31.300]   He's going from plants versus zombies to field runners to, to a bunch of little doctors
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.300]   use to this.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.460]   So, so anyway, so that's for the, for the kids.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:35.460]   It's good stuff.
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:39.340]   For the adults, there is a, I've been playing around with a lot of, we use a lot of hardware
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:42.120]   switchers, but I've been playing around with software switchers at my house.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:48.100]   So my house is like the anti what I do at work, which is like how, how, how bare bones
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.920]   can I be at least on the video end and still get three cameras or a bunch of other stuff
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.580]   all mixed together and everything else.
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:58.140]   And so they just released, I've been playing around with this program called Wirecast and
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:00.060]   Wirecast Pro and Wirecast.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.700]   Well, we use it a lot to actually do the streams, you know, and we weren't using the edit stuff,
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:06.300]   but the edit stuff is actually built pretty well.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:11.780]   I've got three HP 40s that are all wired into my Mac Pro and, and then I'm editing between
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:15.940]   them and then I have a little whiteboard that I use ArtRage for on my, on my laptop.
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:19.180]   And, and I've got like a lot, this whole little camera system that I'm all putting together.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:24.500]   Anyway, it's, it is, if you're looking for kind of a software based editor on the Mac,
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.100]   it is, and the PC, it runs on the PC.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:27.900]   I just use it on the Mac.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:33.540]   It is a, the new version is a lot easier to use and it's a lot, it's pretty, it's pretty
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:34.540]   fluid.
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:38.220]   And quickly it'll, you can do a presenter, which basically lets you find any laptop or
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:42.100]   any, or any computer on their network and just present it screen like it's another camera.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:45.060]   And, and, and built in, it has all the streaming stuff.
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:49.300]   So you can stream up to all my Mac Pro up to six or seven streams, different resolutions
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.300]   to different locations.
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.580]   You just kind of line them up and start streaming out.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.820]   So, so it's a, it's a great little thing.
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:59.900]   If you want to see it in person tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, this is actually
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.060]   from Merlin's suggestion.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:08.100]   Merlin had suggested that I, that I talk about our naming conventions and files, you know,
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.220]   are backing up and stuff like that.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.860]   So I decided that we, we do in the Pixel Core, but it's usually internal that every Wednesday
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:17.340]   we do, or almost every Wednesday we do a stream talking about something.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:21.860]   And so I decided that tomorrow morning at 8 I'm going to talk about, you know, how we
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:28.060]   kind of basics of how we do our, our, you know, how we do our organization of our files
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:31.980]   and our naming conventions, and also I'm going to show you the, the toaster that we use and
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:34.820]   the raw drives and how we, you know, manage that process.
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:37.420]   Do you record these and make them available after you do it?
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.420]   We record some of them.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.420]   I'm in the process.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:40.420]   I just want you to record this one.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:44.340]   Well, we're going to do something that's a little bit more organized next, next, in,
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:49.380]   in December that's for Mac break that is like shorter and more, more condensed.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:52.860]   This one is going to be really a Q and A and kind of a live stream.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:56.140]   And but we'll definitely, you know, we've been kind of keeping in mind we're, we're incorporating
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.980]   some, a bunch of stuff to record them in the right now.
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:02.460]   So it's just, it's just one of those things like I, it's so many.
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:04.860]   I'm, I'm doing the same thing you're doing normally, which is that I'm running the live
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.780]   mix and I'm doing all those other pieces.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:10.320]   And so anyway, so that's so it's, so it's, you'll see, you'll see my little, you'll see
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.660]   Wirecast in action tomorrow because that's what I'm using for.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.660]   That sounds awesome.
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:14.660]   That's cool.
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.660]   Yeah, it should be fun.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.660]   And you'll be able to, people will be able to text message.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.900]   I have a little, I have some, I have our producer in my ear and so people can go on
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:22.580]   the chat and they can chat stuff and choose feeding questions into my ear and then I'm
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.580]   answering them.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:24.580]   So it's kind of square.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:25.580]   It's a square space site.
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.300]   Our square, the Pixel Core is a square space site.
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.300]   Who did your design?
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.860]   I did actually.
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:32.500]   Not the, the picture was done by McKay.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:33.500]   I did.
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:34.500]   This is really cool.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:35.500]   Look at that.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:36.500]   It works well, isn't it?
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:37.500]   Look at that.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:38.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.500]   So it's awesome.
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:42.500]   No, it was all, it was, I, you know, I, I laid it out.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.300]   There's some things that, that I, you know, would do differently now.
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:48.980]   We're kind of in another redesign at the moment, but it's, it definitely, and we do a
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.100]   lot of, and that's where the live stream is going to be.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:54.540]   So pixel core.com/live-stream is what we should bookmark.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:57.980]   And then if you're, if you're following me, I'll post it on Twitter and on the Pixel
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:00.420]   Core Twitter as well tomorrow morning to remind people.
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:06.140]   So if you want to remember, I'll post a straight URL to both, both those Twitter's tomorrow.
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:08.900]   And but anyway, but that's going to be using the Wirecast and the Wirecast is brand new
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.980]   this week, the new 4.0.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:14.700]   And, and so it's definitely worth, you'll see it kind of an action and I'll probably
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:17.420]   talk about that a little bit as well.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:24.300]   Pixel Core.com/live-stream or follow Alex, Alex, Alex Lindsey on Twitter or @PixelCore.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.860]   For the corporate account.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.660]   And Telestream I think is the name of the company that makes it.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.660]   Telestream makes it, yeah.
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:29.660]   It's in German I think, right?
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:30.660]   No, no, no.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:31.660]   They're attacking them.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:37.260]   They make, well Wirecast is the one they also, they also have an episode, which is the super
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:38.260]   high end compression.
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:41.260]   And they also bought, and this is probably what Merlin's thinking of the-
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.260]   ScreenFlow?
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.260]   Yeah, ScreenFlow.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.260]   So they, they have ScreenFlow as well.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:49.700]   And then they make some hardware stuff that turns SDI streams to IP, which makes it easier
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:50.700]   to deal with them.
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.100]   So it's good stuff.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.100]   I'm with you, Merlin.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:55.100]   I'm just going to nod.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.100]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:00.060]   I know, seriously, that sounded like some kind of a meeting of Roosevelt's cabinet.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.180]   I just heard a lot of letters.
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:10.940]   My pick and then we're going to run is a Google voice now in the iTunes app store.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:11.940]   Is that today?
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:12.940]   Today.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:13.940]   As we spoke.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:17.700]   In fact, run, run, run and get it because who knows?
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.860]   Apple, of course, didn't approve it very famously a year ago.
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:26.180]   In fact, Google has a little fun with Apple in the screenshots here on iTunes.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:32.540]   If you zoom in and look, why some of these messages were sent July 9, 2009.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:37.500]   So either this person doesn't get a lot of phone calls or maybe these are the same screenshots
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:40.420]   Google submitted a year and a half ago.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:43.660]   Now, now, Apple has said clearly they never rejected the app.
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:47.540]   It just, it just got, you know, it has one of those old fashioned desk drawers where the
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:48.940]   back of the drawer is a little bit low.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:49.940]   Sometimes papers are sort of-
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:50.940]   We never said no.
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:51.940]   We just never said yes.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:54.700]   An oversight, a simple oversight, simple oversight.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:59.860]   Clearly there's some really seriously agile development going on with the app.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:03.820]   By the way, there are only as we record eight ratings, but all of them five star.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.340]   Apparently, it does exactly what you would want it to do.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.740]   This is huge for me.
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.740]   It's very huge.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:11.700]   I have a Google number and it's on my, actually on my business card, but I never use it because
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:12.700]   I'd be honest.
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:15.940]   One of the big reasons I use an Android phone is for Google voice integration.
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:18.060]   So I'm going to have to re-look at this, you know.
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:21.260]   It's the actual name of the actual product.
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:22.260]   Google voice.
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:25.460]   Yeah, don't be fooled because there are, well, you could be fooled, but there are some really
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.460]   good-
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.900]   Yeah, I've got that black swan thing to get me started.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:32.340]   There are some alternatives that are not Google, but this one is from Google.
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.340]   If you look-
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.340]   It's interesting.
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.340]   If you search for voice, it doesn't come up on the first page.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:36.340]   You guys search for Google voice.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.340]   Google voice.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.340]   Google voice, baby.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.340]   Downloaded it.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:40.340]   I'm so excited.
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:41.340]   Got it.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:46.140]   And somebody is saying in the chatroom, no space, but I did it with a space and I found
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:47.140]   it.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:48.140]   All right.
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:49.500]   Everybody, we appreciate you joining us.
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:54.220]   Once again, a reminder that special deal on Drobo through the end of the year through
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:47:05.420]   our holiday specials, $100 on the new four-bay Drobo, the go-to Drobo.com/MBW29er.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:09.380]   MBW29er, and use the offer code MBW299.
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:14.020]   That is a new deal for Drobo just for you through the holidays.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:19.060]   It doesn't say exactly when the drop-dead date is on this, so I wouldn't wait.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:27.740]   It does say, for $100 in holiday savings on a four-bay Drobo, Drobo.com/MBW299.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.300]   Thank you very much everybody for being here.
[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:30.780]   Now you get back to work.
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:32.100]   Great time is over.
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:42.100]   [MUSIC]
