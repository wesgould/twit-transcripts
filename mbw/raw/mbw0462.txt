[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.440]   is fit to print from Cupertino.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   Joining me this week, Leo Laporte
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.800]   is on vacation, but we still have the rock, the foundation
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.320]   of the show, Andy and Notco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.480]   How are you, Andy?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.980]   Right.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.480]   I'm concerned that it sounds a lot like we're
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.280]   not going to talk about iPods this week,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.520]   for like the end time ever.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.920]   We are.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.080]   We actually are going to talk about iPods this week, Andy.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.640]   Holy cats.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.960]   Thank you.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.120]   OK, good.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.640]   I've got like a year and a half worth of stuff to talk about.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.880]   And it's going to be a good show.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   Great.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880]   Thank you.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.680]   We have 30 seconds set aside for you in the third block, Andy.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.920]   I hope you can run with it.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.640]   Also joining us, we have Serenity Caldwell from Imor.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.760]   How are you, Serenity?
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   Hi, I'm doing well.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.360]   It's very, very humid in Boston.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.520]   I feel like I give a weather report every time I come on Mac
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.200]   Break, so I might as well continue.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.000]   It's very humid here.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.920]   I'm very grateful for air conditioning.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   It went from minus 30 here to about 80 Fahrenheit,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.160]   and what feels like the blink of an eye.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.640]   It's just wrong.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.840]   Boy.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.960]   The world is wrong.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.800]   Also joining us for the first time,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.240]   I've had the privilege of podcasting with her before,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.400]   but I believe this is her first time on the Twit network,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.200]   previously from Apple, currently at Dropbox Ashley.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.800]   How are you, Ashley?
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.280]   I'm doing really well.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.120]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.960]   It's my first time on Twit, but it's funny.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.800]   I used to listen to this in high school.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   So well, at least this went into contact.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.120]   So it's pretty fun to be on this network now.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.680]   And you came back from vacation,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.640]   landed a few minutes ago, and immediately joined us,
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.320]   which is awesome.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.600]   Yeah, happy to.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.520]   All right, so starting off, there
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.840]   was an article that created a lot of ripples in the Apple sphere.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.440]   And it was an article that was, I think, deliberately
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680]   provocative is a good way of setting it up.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   It was an article about Apple and Safari.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.800]   Safari famously comes from KHTML,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.720]   which was a Linux-based web browser.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.320]   They became WebKit, and Apple made the Safari browser
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.720]   on top of WebKit.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.640]   And now, sort of the charge has been made
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   that Apple and WebKit are no longer really good internet
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.400]   citizens, that they do not support the most current standards,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.840]   things that are, in essence, designed to make web apps
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.960]   function more like native applications.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.440]   And the provocative charge was that Safari is becoming
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.480]   the new internet explorer.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.680]   Some people are saying that that's not the right analogy,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.440]   that what Safari is doing may not be good,
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.240]   but it's actually different than internet explorer.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.360]   But Andy, you've been using browsers, I'm guessing,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.600]   for quite a while.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.480]   Do you have a take on this?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.920]   Yeah, I mean, I was reading it.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.040]   And as always, when you're talking about fundamental core
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.680]   web browser technologies, my user response is not thoughtfully
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.080]   and then email a bunch of people I know who actually
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.560]   developed for the web.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.680]   And this piece, I've read it a few times,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.000]   and he lands a few points.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.120]   There's maybe a larger question that if every single browser
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.480]   needs to sort of kind of need to suit
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.440]   the needs of the internet in general,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.600]   and that real good change does not
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.760]   happen until you have a standard that
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.480]   can elevate every single web app that's out there.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.320]   And you're not going to get that to happen
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.160]   unless all the core players support it.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.000]   For instance, like imagine--
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.120]   to put it one way, imagine that Flash were actually good
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.400]   and actually healthy for people and doesn't wind up tearing
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.480]   out big chunks of your frontal lobe every time
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.720]   you try to use Flash content.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.040]   Imagine was actually important.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.640]   But then imagine that Apple decided
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.960]   that, no, we're not going to support it.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.360]   That means that it's not only bad for Safari users,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.400]   but it's also bad for that standard as well,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.880]   because developers are not going to want to target it
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.720]   if they know that one of the most popular browsers
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.120]   on the planet is going to use it.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.040]   However, my larger view is that, wow, there's
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.960]   so much crud inside the browser already.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.000]   And there are so many competing standards
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.080]   that I want a more streamlined, more efficient platform,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.240]   not a more complicated one.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.960]   And so although it's very, very important for the browser
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.440]   to stop being just simply a way to display content
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.480]   and to start being an actual active app platform,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.960]   we don't-- Apple doesn't necessarily
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.160]   have to do that by destabilizing its browser
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.400]   and making sure they're adopting every single standard that's
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.560]   being proposed as good as those standards are.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.360]   And the weird reason why they don't necessarily
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.320]   have to do that is because there's Chrome, Google Chrome,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.280]   which is an exceptionally good browser that
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.880]   is very ambitious in supporting standards.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.720]   And if there is a standard that needs to be supported
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.640]   and Google supports it, well, that's that checked off the list.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   And if it turns out that Safari users are getting sort of pushed
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.160]   to the back because there is an app standard that is not
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.880]   being supported, Apple knows that.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.680]   Apple has tried it.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.680]   Apple has implemented it.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.640]   Apple has definitely thought about it.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.880]   And the reason why they're not supporting it right now
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.360]   is not because they're trying to be no good nixes
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.800]   because they simply don't believe in it.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.760]   But if it becomes a popular standard as proven
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.160]   through the Chrome browser, Safari
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.240]   will have it very, very quickly.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.880]   So interesting food for thought, but I
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.000]   thought it was pretty much a non-issue.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.480]   Just to name some of the services,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.520]   that it's Nolan Lawson who wrote the article.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.080]   And I had a couple nice Twitter conversations with him.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   And he's been actively talking to Safari team.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.240]   So it's not like he's just someone who wants to yell
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.800]   and throw rotten fruit at Apple.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.720]   So basically, there's Service Worker,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.200]   which lets you have background tasks
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.960]   like the browser consent notifications.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   There's web components, which are reusable widgets
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.280]   for the web.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.000]   There's Shadow DOM, which means that you don't have
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.520]   to cram everything into the main document object model
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.920]   of the web.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.400]   You can just make subsets of that that can do specifically
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.720]   encapsulated and isolated things.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.520]   And there's Manifest, which is a centralized metadata repository
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   for web apps.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.200]   There are other things, like there's been errors.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   I forget it's called ID-based.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.720]   It's a database service, I believe,
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.640]   for the web that Apple has been either slow or non-prioritized
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.360]   in developing.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.320]   Ashley, Dropbox is both a web platform and a native app
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.840]   platform.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.600]   Do you have a feeling one way or another?
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.240]   I thought this was a really thoughtful piece.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.080]   It's interesting.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.840]   I sort of like what Andy brought up about the fact
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.680]   that Safari's leveraging Chrome as their guinea pig
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.400]   are the testing ground, so to speak,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.720]   and letting them sort of prove out whether or not
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.200]   these are standards they should even adopt.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.240]   I know internally in Dropbox, we have
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.040]   to support Internet Explorer, Safari, and Chrome.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   And I haven't heard too many rumblings about support
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.000]   not being offered in one browser or the other.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.240]   So this piece actually a little bit surprised me.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.760]   I can tell you personally, I picked up Safari
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.920]   and became a user while working at Apple.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.560]   It was sort of encouraged, I would say, by my co-worker.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720]   And only recently within the past two weeks
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.280]   have I actually switched to Chrome for work.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.920]   And I honestly was just a speed thing.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.960]   I just found--
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.920]   I know the tests sort of prove that.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.080]   Or I've seen tests and statistics
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.600]   that say that Safari is fast, right?
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   But I wasn't finding that in my own personal use.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.320]   And so I find the timeliness of this article
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.840]   to be most appropriate, given my recent switch back
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.240]   to Chrome, so it's interesting.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.320]   One of the interesting things that I saw was that everyone--
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.480]   people think it's strange to think
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.320]   that Apple has limited resources, because they're
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.000]   one of the richest companies, most successful companies
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.720]   in the world.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.160]   But there's a limit to those engineers.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.560]   An engineer can't work on feature A and feature B
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.600]   at the same time.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.840]   So they have to make choices.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.480]   And some of Apple's Safari members have spoken about this
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.920]   and said that they didn't have time
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.360]   to prioritize some of the things that were on this list.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   But they did do things like iCloud Keychain,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.920]   like Safari WebView, like the extensions for content blockers.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.080]   Ren, is there a difference maybe between the priorities
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.440]   of a company like Apple and our parties
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.320]   with a company like Google or Firefox?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.800]   Well, I mean, I think every company
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   is going to have their own priorities and their own focuses
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.400]   that they believe are their tier one top-of-the-line issues.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.640]   A company like Apple is very, very interested and focused
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.360]   on security.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.880]   And obviously, they're focused on making sure
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.360]   that they have a fast and strong, stable platform.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.640]   And I feel like with a WebKit and everything else,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.320]   they've constantly been pushing the bar
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.920]   and pushing the envelope when it comes to Safari.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.160]   And unfortunately, I mean, we see this in iBooks.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.000]   We see this in iBooks, which is basically a WebKit skin
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.120]   over sort of the ePub framework,
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.480]   where iBooks Author is a great example of something
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.040]   where the ePub framework wasn't where Apple wanted it to be.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.360]   So they added a bunch of custom specialty CSS classes
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.160]   that no other browser can read
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.240]   and no other ebook reader can read,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   because they wanted to do special things
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.880]   that they just could not do, could not build
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.400]   with the standard framework.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.520]   So I don't necessarily think it's Apple or it's these
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.680]   other folks going away from the standard
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.120]   and issuing the standard saying, "Pupu" to it.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.920]   I think it's very much, we want to try these new things
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.560]   and we want to experiment.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.120]   And sometimes the standard takes a little bit of time
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.440]   and we are 100% committed to the standard.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.120]   But at the same time, we're not going to stop innovating
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   just to wait on a standard checkbox to get checked
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.840]   so that it comes down the pipeline.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.120]   - Do any of you think it's a problem, sorry, then, Rup?
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.600]   But do any of you think it's a problem
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.720]   that Apple isn't sending representatives to these conferences?
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.760]   'Cause that seems to be one of the main points of contention,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.600]   just like sort of representation or being at the table
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.680]   and interested in being at the table.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.560]   - Yeah, it is interesting to me
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.400]   because I know they definitely used to send
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.400]   reps to the EPUB conferences and the W3C conferences.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.360]   I saw that in the article as well
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.880]   and that kind of shocked me a little bit
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.440]   that they're not interested or not.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.040]   - I think they didn't go to this conference.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.560]   They still do the standards.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.040]   They do face to face with the standard stuff,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.040]   but if they didn't go to a conference,
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.560]   this one I forget the name now, it was,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.080]   I'll find it here, something edge and edge.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.240]   - Yeah, edge conference, yeah.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.960]   - But what bothers me is that I remember
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.280]   when there used to be a really great developer conference
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.080]   before WWDC called MacHack
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.960]   and lots of Apple engineers used to attend that conference.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.280]   And they weren't giving keynotes,
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.320]   they weren't giving presentations,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.560]   they were just in T-shirts,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.320]   part of these two or 300 people
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   hanging around a pretty miserable mission in hotel room.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.400]   And the thing is, it's not just about them being there
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.520]   for new standards, it's that if they're having those
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   sort of like person-to-person interactions
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.400]   that happen totally randomly
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.960]   and over the course of three days,
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   they're gonna learn things about how people
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.800]   are interacting with their software
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.320]   that they wouldn't have heard.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.400]   People are gonna be saying things
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.640]   that are very, very truthful to them
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.960]   that they wouldn't hear otherwise.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.920]   And also they have the opportunity
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   without flying the banner of Apple behind them.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   They're just employees of a big company
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.720]   that decided to spend the registration fee
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.520]   for this conference.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.920]   They can also communicate back
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.160]   that here's the problems that we're facing
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.080]   and what ideas do you have.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.480]   And even if it doesn't result in physical features
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   and physical fixes,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.480]   there is a great benefit to the perception that,
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.840]   well, you know what I talked to the,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.440]   I talked to one of the lead developers
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.360]   at Mac Hack last year, I know they were aware of this.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.680]   I know that it's not that they don't care,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.240]   it's not that they're pursuing a different agenda,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   but so let's keep our fingers crossed.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.840]   You can call it a form of PR,
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.520]   but sometimes PR is actually a good thing
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.240]   when you're a company that's this big.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.040]   I will say they don't always announce it,
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.440]   but if you do go to a lot of conferences,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.160]   you will see Apple people there,
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.080]   whether you know it or not.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.920]   And maybe, you know,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.840]   I don't know if anyone actually went to this conference,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.960]   but more and more often lately, especially,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.040]   there are Apple people there.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.560]   They're just in their Clark Kent
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.480]   and Diana Prince disguises, so you don't see them.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   And one of the other criticisms here though,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.800]   is that Apple doesn't allow other,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.600]   for example, on your Mac, you can just use Chrome
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   if you want to support those web technologies.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.440]   But on iOS, regardless of who makes the browser,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.640]   even Chrome and iOS,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.280]   you have to use Apple's rendering engine,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.000]   they don't allow third party rendering engines.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So that iOS basically is an island,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.880]   and if Apple doesn't support the web technologies there,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.040]   that's hundreds of millions of people
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.000]   who don't have access to them.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.440]   And for the people,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.360]   and I will say that, you know,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.520]   if you're a web developer,
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.200]   you have a hammer, everything is a nail.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.720]   You want everything to be a super great web app,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.320]   even when maybe a super great web app
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.160]   is not the best solution for that particular problem.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.600]   But their point of view is that by limiting
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.120]   the selection of browser engine,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.080]   Apple sort of has this walled off garden on iOS.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.200]   - Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.960]   And especially troubling when you look at the numbers
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.880]   that exactly how much news and other content
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.800]   are being consumed, not just on phones,
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.120]   but on iOS devices.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.320]   They have, they really do have like the 800 pound
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.560]   Godzilla position in this industry.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.960]   So if they're making any moves
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.920]   that lock them into an Apple branded browser,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.000]   or maybe even worse,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.720]   try to encourage them to use an Apple branded news gathering
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.880]   and news reading app,
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.120]   that does give them sort of a weird advantage
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.320]   that maybe they shouldn't have.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.640]   And it's not as troubling with Apple
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.120]   as with other companies,
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.080]   because I think they have a very good track record of,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.640]   at the beginning and the end of every day,
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.840]   they decide what is the best thing for our users?
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.440]   How can we make the best experience possible?
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.000]   They're willing to deny users choice toward that end,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.520]   but they are working towards their goals.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.400]   But I agree, I think that's very, very troubling
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.720]   when you cannot just simply decide
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.360]   that I want to have a different rendering engine.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.120]   I wanna make sure that I can access the information
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.920]   I want through the app that I want.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.440]   Because if Apple was able to handle,
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.320]   to hasten the demise of Flash simply by not supporting it
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   on the hottest mobile device that was out there,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.720]   that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.680]   But again, what happens if they're not interested
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.080]   in something that really is in consumer-spaced interests?
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.640]   >> Yeah, it's interesting to me,
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.000]   and maybe this hits closest to home for you, Ashley,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.360]   but we saw a webkit basically get unbundled
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.840]   where suddenly you had API as an HTTP access
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.200]   to web information,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.840]   but it was presented in native apps.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.200]   So you sort of had the browser was initially the way
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.480]   that every bit of web content, FTP,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.960]   and a couple other things aside was consumed.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.280]   And yeah, there was even FTP clients for the web browser.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.320]   But now you can have a weather app that pulls from Yahoo's
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.480]   weather API, but it's not in a browser.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.960]   And you can have messaging services
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.560]   that are in apps and not in browsers.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.480]   And now that's happening even with UIKit apps.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.760]   So with extensibility, Dropbox is an app on iOS,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.880]   but thanks to the extension,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.040]   I can move stuff around without ever actually opening
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.720]   the Dropbox app now.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.440]   So I wonder this push for native web browsers,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.680]   is this sort of becoming an anachronism?
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.760]   Will we really need web browsers,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.040]   or even bundled apps in the future?
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.560]   Or is everything gonna sort of just be discreet functionality
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.440]   that we can call up from everywhere?
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.800]   >> I would love to move to a point where we can just have
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.000]   sort of that, you know, if I think it's sort of
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.400]   what we're seeing with multitasking,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.680]   where what I need from a particular app,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.840]   it can provide it and then I'm done with that app.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.360]   I mean, like you said, I may not even need to open Dropbox app
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.960]   if I just need to access it as a file storage provider.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.520]   So I think that could be really, really amazing.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.280]   I think one of the most exciting things I saw in iOS 9
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.720]   is being able to open a web browser directly from my app
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.400]   without having to move to Safari.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.960]   Will we ever get to a point where we don't even need
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.360]   web browsing or even need Safari?
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.160]   I can't see that happening.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.400]   I, though I am excited about sort of the fact that we can
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.840]   authorize the Dropbox app and move from, you know,
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.240]   a link directly into the app without having
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.320]   to go to Safari anymore.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.440]   Like I think that's just gonna provide a much better
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.080]   and richer customer experience.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.560]   And I think to Andy's point that that's sort of
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.600]   the direction we're gonna head,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.440]   it's gonna be totally based on whether or not
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.760]   it benefits the user's experience or not,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.280]   whether then just cutting out an app
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.800]   just for cutting it out, say.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.080]   >> It's super interesting,
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.960]   it's contrasting what I just asked Andy about,
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.200]   whether you can't set different default apps,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.840]   you can't use different rendering engines.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.000]   So, Andy, on the iPhone, with this new Safari View Controller,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   you basically get an embedded version of Safari.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.600]   Apple's clearly focusing on making that the experience
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.640]   and arguably if you change defaults
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.800]   or you had a different rendering engine,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.520]   as Safari becomes a view rather than a separate web browser,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.680]   you wouldn't benefit from that anyway.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.400]   >> Yeah, no, I actually think it's a really awesome thing
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.920]   that they're doing with iOS 9
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   in terms of integrating the View Controller.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.760]   I know some people are a little bit iffy on it,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.720]   they like their custom implementations,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.760]   but to me, the ability to get access to your iCloud keychain
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.080]   and to have that integrated,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.600]   to have all of the speed boosts
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.000]   and everything that comes with Safari,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.800]   the security that comes with Safari,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.880]   and not have to use MKWebView or anything complicated
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.960]   like that to display web pages in your app,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.760]   I think that's a huge win,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.960]   both for users and for developers.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.720]   It makes it easier for developers.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.200]   Now, while some developers still want to make
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.520]   their own custom views, probably,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   but I think the majority of developers
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.400]   should be very well treated by this,
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.840]   especially on the iPad.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.400]   When you think about iPad browsing
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   and the ability to make custom shortcut keyboards,
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.080]   I could see being able to use that
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.360]   and connect with the, it's read-only
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.680]   the Safari View Controller, right?
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.880]   In apps?
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.240]   - I believe so.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.160]   - Yeah.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.000]   No, I just, I think it's a great idea.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.520]   - Yeah, it's gonna be, if nothing else,
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.560]   I'm super happy that stuff like this comes up
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.720]   and that we have these discussions,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.080]   because the direction of the web going,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.960]   it was almost like this thing, Apple tradition,
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.560]   there's a story that when Apple was trying to figure out
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.080]   how to make the SDK for the iPhone,
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.440]   they considered several things,
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.200]   bringing AppKit over from the Mac,
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.360]   using WebKit as the interface,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.000]   and they decided that neither of those things
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.760]   were a good solution and they made UIKit,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.240]   which is a native framework.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.160]   WebOS famously used WebKit as their framework
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   and it was just never fast enough.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.600]   And they always say the web is getting faster,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.640]   we need to make the web faster,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.240]   but as fast as the web gets those same underlying architecture
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.000]   as makes native even faster.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.920]   And with things like Swift,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.680]   native is developing faster too.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   And to, you know, Don Melton famously who ran WebKit
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.360]   and Safari at Apple did one of his,
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.520]   calm the explet of down tweets about all this,
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.880]   saying they're two different tools
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.240]   and you need to have both in your tool set.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.120]   But Andy, I think that's the most important part of this
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.920]   is that we have this discussion from time to time,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.720]   and sort of re-evaluate our own preconceptions.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.240]   >> Yeah, I mean, one of the,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.800]   I'm thinking back for some reason
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.840]   to news that came out out of this
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.000]   really, really hush hush intelligence conference,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.080]   where a lot of the big players in digital
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.640]   and also in government spy agencies
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.280]   were coming together and talking about,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.600]   amongst other things, the Snowden revelations.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.000]   And one of the things that came out of that conference
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.080]   was that the fact that there was so much discussion
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.120]   that came out from the public about these revelations
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.880]   means that we're not talking enough
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.160]   about what we're doing, we need to disclose more,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.280]   we need to be more upfront
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.040]   and we need to think about what we're actually doing.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.280]   And the application to the situation is that
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.160]   the more Apple can be seen to discuss these things,
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.880]   maybe they'll do things that you don't necessarily approve of,
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.720]   but you will understand and trust the reasons
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.040]   why they're doing it at the very least,
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   and that's why discussion is so valuable.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.320]   >> No, I think that's absolutely true.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.600]   One of the other interesting bits in news that came out
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.680]   on July 1st, Johnny, I have assumed his role
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.080]   of Chief Design Officer at Apple
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.640]   and the updatedapple.com.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.680]   >> It's fun to say.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.960]   >> Basically, everything I look about this,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   I see him just like putting his stove top hat,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.040]   just his pan on the top of his head,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.760]   sling a bag of apple seeds and just walk in barefoot
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.120]   across the entire world spreading design.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.920]   It was a really majestic sort of description
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   of someone who certainly has a lot to do,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.400]   but they're not really explaining what it is
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.360]   he's going to have to be doing.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.960]   >> I thought it was great because they just,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.640]   they made a very subtle update to Apple.com,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.320]   but they also added bios for the two people
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.200]   who are basically replacing him as day-to-day managers
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.960]   of Apple, the new vice president,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.600]   and that's Alan Dai who's taking over human interface,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.200]   the HI Group, and Richard Holworth who's taking over
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.320]   industrial design, the ID Group.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   But it caused a bit of a kerfuffle because on the internet,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.560]   it says that they are on Apple.com,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.360]   it says that they're reporting to Tim Cook and not Johnny Ive.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.280]   And a couple of things sort of stood out at me there,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.320]   one is that all the vice presidents listed on Apple.com
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.480]   report to Tim Cook, Ken Ferry on Twitter pointed out that,
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.800]   no, Steve Jobs only had one direct report
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.160]   and that was Steve Wozniak and Steve Wozniak
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.600]   had no direct reports and everyone else went technically
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.800]   to Tim Cook.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.240]   And Apple, sort of, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.600]   but Apple, it just doesn't see org charts
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.080]   the way other companies do, I think,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.720]   and it's dangerous to sort of read into
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.360]   what they put on Apple.com.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.720]   >> Absolutely, Apple.com, I mean, come on,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.760]   Apple.com is designed to showcase for the shareholders
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.240]   and it's designed to showcase for the media, basically.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.960]   It's not really designed to,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.040]   like if Apple really wanted to roll out a,
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.760]   here's how our management structure works
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.920]   and here are lines and they could,
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.240]   but they're not going to.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.840]   Their management structure, I feel like,
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.360]   is just as much a, not necessarily a trade secret,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.640]   but as part of what makes Apple, it's part of how they
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.200]   build their company.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.320]   And just because you have, oh,
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.680]   they report directly to Tim Cook,
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.080]   that means Johnny I was thinking about retiring.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.560]   No, it means they're vice presidents.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.120]   And for all the VPs, talk to Tim Cook.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.360]   That's how it works.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.200]   They're VPs.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.960]   >> Johnny Saruji, who runs Chipsets,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.400]   doesn't report to Dan Richeo,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.320]   your reports to Tim Cook.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.920]   It is interesting, but I think it's hard to make a case,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.680]   whatever you feel about Johnny,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.880]   whether you feel this is him starting to retire
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.360]   or him going in a different direction
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.080]   and maybe assuming more responsibility,
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.880]   whether you think this is on a elaborate plan
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.480]   to hide his salary from Wall Street,
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.000]   or you think it's just a way to make him content
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.880]   and happy to continue his job,
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.280]   I think Apple.com, you worked there, actually.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.040]   I think Apple.com is never a good way to assess
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.600]   any of this stuff.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.440]   >> No, absolutely.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.040]   I think Serenne hit it right on the head
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.920]   in terms of, you know, it's for shareholders.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.840]   It's for media.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.160]   It's to sort of placate the people responsible
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.760]   for our stock price and make sure,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.920]   well, they're stock price
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.080]   and make sure that there's no panic.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.600]   I do think it is interesting though
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.920]   that they're reporting to Tim,
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.640]   but I feel like that's an organizational thing.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.800]   Like maybe Tim writes their performance reviews
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.280]   at the end of the year or something.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.040]   If we're under the auspition,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.760]   if we're under the auspition that Johnny
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.560]   is sort of accepting or taking on a little bit less
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.080]   responsibility or a little bit less of the management
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.920]   responsibility as was in one of those articles recently,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.360]   then I think it makes perfect sense that he wouldn't,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.320]   they sort of wouldn't directly report to him
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.080]   and a managerial structure.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.240]   And Rene, does Apple still do that weekly,
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.840]   like upper executive, all hands meeting?
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.960]   >> You mean one that lets people not watch TV
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.360]   on Sunday nights because they're busy?
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.880]   I'm not heard specifically, but I imagine they do.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.280]   >> Yeah, I don't know for sure,
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.480]   but I remember hearing things about how it's,
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.400]   there's not a whole lot of barriers between people
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.960]   who work in different, senior vice presidents,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.520]   being able to collaborate and meet together.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.400]   So they're all kind of, I interpret that as to mean
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.200]   that they were all sort of reporting
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.800]   to Tim Cook directly anyway,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.840]   in that there are just people in a room talking about,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.200]   here's week to week, here's the status
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.320]   of pretty much every project and how the pieces
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.360]   are fitting together.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.800]   So I mean, absolutely right.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.200]   I mean, it's hard to think that Apple
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.080]   without a deliberate organization chart
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.240]   is one without organization or one that looks like
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.640]   it's that people are being pushed out.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.600]   The take that I always had about Johnny Ive
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.120]   was that this new description of his role
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.720]   allows him to design everything as opposed to
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.760]   being really stuck in a more formal structure.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.600]   And I can't, it's unusual for me to see someone
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.120]   who is that creative stay in the same job
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.440]   for that many years, people just get that itch,
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.680]   even if they have the dream job at Pixar,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.440]   the dream job at ILM,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.120]   the dream job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.960]   there's something about that kind of brain that says,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   "I've been doing the same thing for 11 years now.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.680]   I want to design coffee pots for Target
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.720]   because that's gonna be really interesting for me
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.040]   for the next three or four years."
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.800]   So, yeah, I feel like-- - That's interesting,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.560]   like does Johnny just pop in and out of design meetings
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.120]   or would you just get an email?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.680]   - I wonder, like you said,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.840]   he sort of ostensibly gets to oversee
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.600]   sort of all design of Apple now, right?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.800]   So, if you're making a mockup in your designer,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   might you get an email from Johnny
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.640]   'cause he saw something and wants you to tweak it
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.920]   or something, like there's no limit
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.080]   sort of to his oversight, we think.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.120]   So, I wonder what that means practically,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.360]   I guess we'll find out over the next couple of years.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.560]   - It just apparates apparently,
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.160]   it's something that all British designers can do.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.000]   (whooshing)
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.960]   But to Andy's point, I think that's absolutely true
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   because we've seen what happens with incredibly talented
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.760]   people when they sort of have no constraints
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.360]   or inspiration left and you become like Bill Watterson,
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.320]   who feels like your work is done and you retire
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.440]   and your magnificent legacy is behind you,
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.600]   or you decide you no longer need editing
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.080]   and you start making a bunch of crazy products and prequels
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.840]   that people are really baffled by.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.680]   And neither of those are really good.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:11.240]   I'm happy that Johnny I was doing this, for example,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.920]   rather than having something awkward happen
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   where an Apple product comes out that's just completely zany.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.720]   Although there is news that all Apple stores
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.480]   are revamping with third party accessory selection,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.320]   Serenity, these ones designed by Apple.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.800]   So, like your Mophie, the box for your Mophie Juice Pack
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.080]   could have come out of Cupertino now
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.840]   instead of Mophie headquarters.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   - So, this is a little bit crazy to me.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.120]   This actually feels like a Steve Jobs move.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.520]   I have to admit, like an old world Apple move
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.320]   where it's back to the, we want to control
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.760]   every aspect of the customer experience, right?
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.400]   Where I actually totally get Apple saying
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   to accessory manufacturers, yo, you know,
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   we're selling this in the store
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.960]   and some of this packaging is terrible
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.720]   and environmentally unfriendly and impossible to open.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   And let's talk about incorporating some packaging aspects
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.320]   into the MFI program.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.440]   That's how I feel like this conversation actually went
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.200]   where it's like, yeah, this doesn't look great
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.720]   on our store shelves and we'd like you to make better packaging.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.080]   Is it actually confirmed that Apple is making the packaging?
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.800]   'Cause that's the part that rings false to me.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.040]   I feel like them giving guidelines down
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.240]   to accessory manufacturers saying your packaging probably
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.640]   has to be made out of these materials
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.480]   and can only be fastened in these ways
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.160]   and has these colors, like that makes sense to me.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.920]   But Apple actually being like, we're going to package this.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.200]   We're going to put aside some of our factories
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.160]   and take your third party accessories and--
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.280]   Sheila and Mark-ombs has too much time on her hands.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.440]   Give her a mofiy.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.080]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.200]   It rubs a little wrong for me.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.040]   Yeah, like our device manufacturers, our margins are so great.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.600]   We got nothing but time and budget to design a better box.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.280]   But that is absolutely true though.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   I mean, just the stuff that's like a product box
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.080]   is just like stacked up in my office.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.000]   And here's the box that Apple's wristwatch comes in
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.320]   and you could put your eye out on this.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.680]   And it's just one of the--
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   it's such a sharp and such a tight tolerance
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.240]   that it just does not want to come apart.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.120]   And yet, right next to it--
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   again, that did not plan this.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.160]   But here is the box that Motorola's flagship phone comes in.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.040]   And it's a perfectly fine box, but it's something
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.000]   that pretty much anything can come in.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.480]   And it doesn't really convey this
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.520]   is a really wonderful special object, which the Moto X actually
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:41.960]   is.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.400]   And you can certainly make the case that, look,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.800]   it's just a box you're going to hold onto this for a couple
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.760]   of weeks until you realize you don't need to throw it away.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.640]   And then unless you know you're going to sell this on gazelle
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.680]   in a year or two, you're probably going to throw it out.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.320]   But it is part of what communicates
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.360]   the entire consumer experience.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.200]   And so long as it's not pushing some of these device
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.800]   manufacturers and accessory manufacturers
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.760]   into an early grave, if they could impart a little bit
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.400]   of design wisdom on here's how to make packaging that really
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.760]   makes your customer really, really happy
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:17.440]   that they gave you $60 for this iPad easel all to the better.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.960]   And I love how you just have those boxes right next to you
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   just hanging out.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.200]   There's a real advantage to not removing clutter.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.040]   It's nice to be lazy sometimes.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.720]   This is the one case out of two months where I could say,
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.040]   you see, there's a reason why I never throw everything out
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.560]   and just keep it heaped up on that little desk over there.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.960]   You were wrong, A&E. You were wrong.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.720]   See, Mom, I didn't have to clean my room.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720]   [LAUGHS]
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.760]   We're going to take a quick break because I know that Leo
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.440]   Laport, even though he is on vacation,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.840]   even though he and Lisa are flooding our Instagrams
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.880]   with the most beautiful pictures imaginable,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.120]   he still had time to stop by and tell us about something
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.360]   amazing.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.520]   Hey, don't let me interrupt.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.360]   All right, let me interrupt.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:56.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.080]   I'm going to interrupt because I've got to pay the bills here.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.120]   We'll be back with more of Mac Break Weekly in just a little
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.320]   bit.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.000]   But I've stopped by to remind you that Mac Break Weekly is

[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.520]   that will teach you anything you're a curious mind
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.200]   might want to know.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.080]   They just released a brand new series of courses
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.920]   on the Creative Cloud.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.000]   Did you just get your update?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.080]   I did.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.720]   The 2015 Creative Cloud.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.000]   This is one of the things Linda does.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.480]   It's so cool.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.840]   They work directly with the software publishers.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.760]   So when the new version comes out, they're ready.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.120]   They've got the courses all ready to go.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.960]   Of course, they're teachers of the best.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.200]   They're people who work in the business.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.920]   Great teachers like Bertman Roy, many of our friends,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.560]   many people you see on Twitch.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.000]   I mean, imagine learning Photoshop from Bertman Roy.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.960]   You don't get better than that.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.120]   They've got tutorials now on the new Creative Cloud
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.360]   Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Audition.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   Use that for years.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.440]   Love Audition.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.600]   After Effects, InDesign, and Illustrator.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.080]   And talk about on top of it, they've just released a first look
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.640]   at developing for Apple Watch, which is awesome.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.400]   That's how on top of it they are.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.320]   Apple's WWDC was what, two weeks ago?
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.800]   Linda.com.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.600]   I've been doing the photo stuff because I just
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.720]   want to be a better photographer.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.800]   And taking courses from friends like Ben Long, who really
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   can help you get a better grip on your creative talents.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.320]   So great.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.240]   You can watch and learn from the best in the business.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.520]   People who are great teachers, who are working in the business.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.360]   They're beautifully produced video courses.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.200]   You can stream them whenever you want on your schedule, wherever
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.560]   you want on your iOS or Android device, on your desktop.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.520]   You can also learn at your own pace.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   You don't have to watch the courses from beginning to end.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   They're structured in such a way that you can do that.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.760]   But you can also watch little bite-sized chunks.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.880]   Or look at the transcripts and jump right to the part you want.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.600]   I am a big fan, and I think you're going to find a course.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.760]   Well, here's the deal.

[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.480]   You could just dip in a few of them.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.720]   In fact, I would do that because there's so much great stuff
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:38.920]   there.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.440]   It's a treasure trove.

[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.320]   Now back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.520]   You could not even tell Leo was in ancient medieval European
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.640]   castle when he did that.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.080]   That was amazing.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.960]   Back to the news, we saw finally after the show yesterday,
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.720]   iTunes--
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.280]   certainly yesterday-- last week, iTunes 12.2 came out,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.000]   which brought Apple Music to the Mac.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.600]   We're going to talk about Apple Music some more in a little
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:32.960]   while.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.720]   But one of the interesting things inside this new version
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.240]   of iTunes were images for iPods of previously unseen
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.680]   colors--
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:47.040]   nanos, iPods touch, iPods shuffle, all the iPods, basically.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.680]   And that led people to believe that Apple might once again
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.000]   rev the iPod, which has stayed un-revved in a curiously long
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.280]   amount of time.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.160]   So what's interesting about this also
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.800]   is that I've heard that they're actually skipping a generation
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.680]   with the iPod instead of going to iPod 6, comma 1, which
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.200]   would be the next iPod touch in line.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.040]   They're going to iPod 7, comma 1.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.720]   What happened to 6, comma 1 is, I guess,
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.880]   a story for another day.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.560]   But that sort of means that they're
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.000]   going to leapfrog technologies, because those numbers are
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.440]   usually not always, but usually tied to processor generations.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.040]   Right now, the iPod touch, like the Apple TV,
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.800]   is stuck on an Apple A5 chip.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.760]   It's a 32-bit chip in a now 64-bit world.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.160]   So, Srenity, I am super excited if Apple cleans sort
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.840]   of clean shelf of all the 32-bit architecture,
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.960]   and we get maybe, minimally, at least an A7 powered iPod
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.160]   touch this year.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   Yes, please, please, God.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.760]   Yes, I was a little worried that the iPod touch was done,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.960]   that they were saying goodbye to its sign-a-ra.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.280]   But I'm glad that it's not.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.320]   I think with the launch of Apple Music,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.680]   they definitely need something in the lineup
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.120]   that can hold those lovely Apple Music offline songs that
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.400]   isn't necessarily an iPod.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.840]   Again, it's a way to, even with an Android application,
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.680]   it's a way to get the younger generation, the folks who
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.400]   are using family sharing on Apple Music,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.320]   on into the iOS ecosystem without having
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320]   to pay for a phone and a subscription plan.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.640]   I think that moving up to 64-bit architecture
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.880]   is a huge win.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:29.640]   The more devices that we can get out of that hole, the better.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.760]   And I'm really excited for the fancy colors.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.920]   I kind of love collecting iPod shuffles.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.800]   It's one of my secret, bad collectors items, children's
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.440]   books, and iPod shuffles.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.800]   So I have one from almost every generation,
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.360]   so I'm looking forward to maybe getting a gold iPod shuffle.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.440]   Table laminated in all the iPod shuffle colors.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.840]   Ashley, they said that they were going
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.920]   to let developers target 64-bit only at WWDC.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.320]   And there will be legacy devices.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.080]   Like, iOS 8 still supports the older iPod touch.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.400]   And some of the older iPhones, I think, the 4S iPad 2 probably.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.080]   Is it a big deal for you for Apple
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.880]   to get their processor architecture all onto 64-bit?
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.920]   Absolutely.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.480]   Absolutely.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.800]   I think I echo Serenity's excitement
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.520]   about dropping the 32-bit options.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.320]   I think they're finally dropping.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.080]   iPad 2 support, which is nice, as well as iPhone-- well,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.800]   maybe not yet.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.600]   iPhone 4S, I hope, is going to be--
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.240]   support is going to be dropped as well.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.520]   One of the interesting things to me
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.880]   is people always point to iPods as the gateway
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.800]   for kids getting Apple devices, especially if they don't need
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.400]   an iPhone yet.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.040]   But I guess maybe it's a different age range.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.480]   I always find kids around maybe 10 and under want iPads.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.760]   They're most excited for that and getting on YouTube
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.240]   and playing games on their iPads.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.720]   Could anybody anecdotally speak to if anybody
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.520]   then their families wants iPods?
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.800]   Because I sort of forgot they existed, to be honest.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.320]   I think primarily they want dads or their big brothers
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.080]   or sisters old iPhones.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.800]   There's definitely a heritage thing sort of going down.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.640]   But there's such a big opportunity, I think,
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.040]   for the iPods, the entire line that
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.480]   are exist right now that weren't there just a few years ago.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.680]   As Renee said, remember that I think
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.120]   one of the first reasons why Apple even introduced an iPod
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.240]   shuffle was that was back when the iTunes store was all under DRM.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.640]   And so you need-- given that at that point,
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.480]   even if you go into any drugstore and buy a really decent 50,
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.040]   60, $70, $80 MP3 player, Apple needed
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.800]   to be able to sell people cheap MP3 players that would be able to play
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.960]   the stuff that they sold.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.040]   So Apple Music makes it a lot more relevant.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.320]   But also there's the health app that makes these--
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.120]   it's a whole new ball game for this sort of stuff.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.960]   I mean, I was-- I think that it would be really, really great
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.760]   if Apple extended the benefits of the health app to people who
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.000]   can't necessarily afford a $300, $300, $400 watch.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.200]   And to put the right sort of sensors inside a $75 or $100 iPod
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.280]   shuffle, and not only will it be able to play all that content
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   for the Apple store, but will also be able to do all that motion
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.880]   capture sort of stuff, it will also
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.520]   be able to be a sleep tracker and stuff like that.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.560]   And then sync back to the phone later on
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.920]   when you're being close to the phone.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.560]   That's just such a huge win for everybody.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.360]   So there's just such great opportunity for the iPod now.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.800]   And I totally-- my god, kids really
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.520]   wanted the iPod touch when it came out.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.560]   We ended up getting them for them for their birthdays
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.240]   a couple of years ago.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.200]   But last time, we were going to update them
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.440]   because there weren't new iPod touches.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.800]   We got them iPad minis.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.400]   And they love the big screen, but they really
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.960]   liked the camera on the iPod touch,
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.440]   because it was so convenient for them
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.400]   to run around holding it almost like a real camera.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.760]   And you do have advantages and pros and cons.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.480]   And if the iPod mini-- sorry, the iPod mini cannibalizes,
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.160]   the iPod touch.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.560]   I don't think Apple cares, but I think
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.080]   it's interesting to have that back in the market.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.440]   The only thing I'm not sure of, Trinity,
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.880]   is what Apple music and DRM will mean for iPods.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.280]   I mean, the iPod touch will be fine.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.360]   It's an internet device, but the iPod nano and the iPod shuffle.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.200]   These aren't devices born of iCloud.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.920]   The Apple watch has taken on a little bit of that.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   You can go running with your Apple watch instead.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.280]   But how do old-school tether to iTunes devices exist in it
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.400]   or live or survive or succeed in the Apple music world?
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.800]   Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.360]   I mean, the iPod touch is different than the other iPods
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.720]   in that it has an internet connection.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.400]   So it's able to work on that regard
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.640]   and connect to the internet, download things from Apple music.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.600]   The shuffles and the nanos--
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.440]   it's a question obviously we've seen the promo
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.560]   our work for future shuffles and future nanos.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.080]   But that is a big question to me.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.520]   How long offline music is allowed to exist?
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.400]   Whether or not there will be-- maybe it's a Bluetooth connect.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   Like maybe we'll see iPods with Bluetooth radios
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.680]   that allow it to do an authentication check with a Wi-Fi
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.360]   device and also remove the tethering problem from, say,
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.680]   just thinking you're shuffled to your Mac.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.120]   I think that would be really cool.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:14.320]   I mean, we've seen Bluetooth-elly type playlist sharing
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.840]   and transfer with the watch.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.960]   So I'm kind of like crossing my fingers.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.600]   I just don't know if that would-- if adding in a Bluetooth-elly
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.920]   antenna would be cost prohibitive to those smaller, cheaper
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920]   devices.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.000]   But that's how I'd potentially see Apple music working
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.960]   on those other ones.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.120]   We also don't-- Apple hasn't said how long offline music will
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.440]   last or will stay until obviously needs authentication
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.680]   from the servers every so often to know that you still
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.560]   have a subscription.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.760]   I'm suspecting it's probably once every 30 days, at least
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.960]   that makes sense in my head.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.560]   I don't know if that's actually going to be the truth,
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.080]   but we'll see.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.240]   I don't know if this is sort of the resurgence of the iPod
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.600]   or the last hurrah, because they didn't update them
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.680]   for, I think, three years.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.280]   I think 2012 was when they last updated them.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.400]   And this is mostly a color reflection
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.720]   and a bump for the iPod touch.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.880]   So I like what you're saying, Andy.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.160]   I think that there is immense value in having those.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.400]   I just don't know if Apple sees the Apple watch as sort of maybe
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.720]   lowering the Apple watch lineup down
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.960]   instead of building back up the iPod lineup.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.400]   No, I don't think so.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   Especially when you talk about the iPod shuffle,
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.640]   given that they can do the FOB price on a Bluetooth-elly
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.920]   is shockingly low.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.040]   And I don't even want to know what Apple would pay for it.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.080]   If Apple-- I'm not going to-- it's stupid for anybody
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.800]   to say what Apple shouldn't do.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.040]   I can only say that as a user and as an enthusiast,
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.880]   that if Apple were to simply say,
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.960]   we're going to sort of take the curse off of--
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.240]   we're going to really underscore how important we're
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.280]   saying the health app is by giving people a really cheap buy-in
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.920]   to have access to that app.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.280]   And if they simply say that we're going to reintroduce--
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.520]   let's forget about the entire rest of the iPod line.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.720]   We're just going to re-up the shuffle.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.160]   We're going to keep the price as far below $100 as possible,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.280]   ideally $49, but $79 would do as well.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.320]   And not only is it good for music content,
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.560]   not only is it that super lightweight music player
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.600]   that people want to wear while they're running
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.160]   or while they're exercising, but it will also
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   be a fitness tracker for just the people who
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.960]   want to be reminded how many times they're
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.040]   getting up and getting down over the course of the day,
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.680]   how many steps are they walking every day.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.880]   That would be so completely aligned with the message
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.760]   that Apple is sending about their mission on this planet.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.920]   I just-- as I say, I'm not saying what they should or shouldn't
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.720]   do, but I'm saying that when I listen to what Apple is saying,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.680]   how they choose to describe themselves,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:45.560]   I keep hearing $79 iPod shuffle with fitness trackers built
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.040]   into it is such a natural fit for that.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.600]   You think that would work, Ashley,
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.800]   if you put an M2 or an M3 chip inside it
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.480]   and it had some form of the motion detecting technology
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.920]   and could do the basic stuff for you.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.040]   Would that be an interesting device?
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.160]   No.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.040]   For me, no.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.680]   I totally-- Andy's clearly passionate about the iPod
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.080]   and he's almost got me sold on its utility,
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.400]   but I just can't see worrying or caring
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.240]   about another device, especially the shuffle.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.800]   Well, first of all, I don't really listen to music that much,
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.040]   especially when I run.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.200]   But I also am very particular about what I'm listening to
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.520]   or what the cue is.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.360]   I don't shuffle music or shuffle podcasts.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.720]   Maybe I'm just not in the right use case for it.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.320]   Honestly, there's a reason that I forgot the iPod exists.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.400]   It's not that compelling to me.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.280]   I don't mind bringing my iPhone on a run.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.120]   So having another more lightweight device to sync it
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.560]   just seems like an extra step I wouldn't do.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.000]   Yeah, it's interesting because there
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.920]   were rumors also about the iPhone 6S Mark Herman
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.040]   with legendary sources in software and hardware
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.120]   was basically-- and he's also gotten super smart now.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.360]   So instead of dumping it all at once,
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.520]   he sorts of strings us along for several days now.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.360]   He's been revealing the innards of what's purportedly
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.200]   the iPhone 6S.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.160]   And it's got much smaller shrunken down chips, much simpler
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:14.760]   chips.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.280]   Maybe something's not the right word.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.320]   Less numerous chipsets.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.280]   And when you get to that sort of efficiency,
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.880]   I mean, it's great because you can get better battery life out
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.160]   of it and less radio interference
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.680]   and all sorts of wonderful things.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.760]   But it also makes smaller devices much better.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.000]   Things that don't require the size of an iPhone
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.560]   or the size of that screen.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.000]   And then maybe that's sort of the future we're going at
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.080]   and technologies that we--
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.680]   Apple's really good at leveraging technologies
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.320]   across the company and what's helping them
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.240]   miniaturize things for the Apple Watch
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.760]   could be a sign of further miniaturization to come.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:55.280]   I mean, we've seen jokes long ago about the iPod ear.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.360]   So it's so tiny and fits in your ear canal.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   Yeah, I mean, I think that miniaturization is awesome.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.600]   And the more work, honestly, the tweaking and the tinkering
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.760]   they can do with the nano and the shuffle,
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.440]   I think will actually pay good dividends
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.760]   into the further development of the watch and vice versa.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.960]   Because anytime you're trying to build really tiny devices,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.920]   you're kind of working in the same ballpark
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.520]   and with the same sort of end goal in mind,
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.680]   even if one is more significantly advanced than the other.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:36.320]   I don't know if I would buy a shuffle now because I have this guy.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.360]   I don't know if I'd buy a shuffle for regular use,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.440]   other than just to put it on my shelf and be like,
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.360]   yeah, it's a shuffle.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.520]   It's awesome.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.520]   But I can see people who do, people who don't have an Apple Watch
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.080]   but want to track their fitness or want to listen to music
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.640]   while running or while out or just anything of the above.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.440]   Don't want a $300 device on their wrist.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.080]   So yeah, I mean, I can definitely see the appeal.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.840]   I think that there's a market for it.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.000]   It's just a question of how far Apple really wants to go down
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.760]   that rabbit hole when everybody in the world is like,
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.480]   the iPod is dead.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.240]   A little granted, they've said that about many other Apple products too.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.720]   So I'm so doomed.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.480]   I like what Annie's saying though, because music as a service
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.360]   went from being the classic iPod and then that became the mini
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.520]   and the nano and then the shuffle.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.760]   And even if Apple doesn't want to take the Apple Watch
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.360]   specifically down market, they might want to take aspects like health.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.920]   Is that what you're saying, Annie?
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.320]   Yeah, I'm basically saying that they've been saying this time and time again
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.520]   that health is, they get look at how much space they gave the health app
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.360]   and the last keynote.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.240]   I think they gave it a whole act of the show to explain exactly
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.760]   all the benefits they're doing.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.400]   And health is one of those unusual beasties for an Apple keynote
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.560]   in that there is no real profit in it.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.680]   It's a feature that makes other things look really, really cool.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:02.120]   And as I said, I bet that you guys have had the same sort of conversations
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.720]   with people inside Apple that when they talk about this product,
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.880]   they're not running down.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.080]   They're not talking about the chamfer angle on a case or a bezel.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.520]   They're talking about how they can improve people's lives with health.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.040]   And I do think that this would be fitting very well with their mandate.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.240]   I don't think it would cannibalize Apple Watch sales at all,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:26.200]   because $350 minimum buy-in versus, again, ideally $79 minimum buy-in.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   And I have no knowledge of this inside Apple,
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:34.120]   but sometimes I wonder if there's a little bit of an itch in the design team to say,
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.640]   we would love to be able to design something that's really, really small
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   and really, really affordable, not for any sort of an altruistic reason,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.520]   necessarily.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.840]   But it's a challenge that they've never shown any proficiency at.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.760]   How good can we make something if we don't have to charge $3,000 for it?
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.000]   Are we up to that certain challenge?
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.400]   So that's something that's been in the back of my mind for a little while,
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.440]   because, again, people who are in those sort of creative roles,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.800]   they have weird motives and weird edges.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:06.640]   And if you don't allow them to pursue every avenue of their talent,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.160]   they start to get a little antsy.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.000]   And I don't mean this disparagingly at all,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.720]   but you just made me sort of picture this image of the Apple design team saying,
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.080]   the new iPhone's going to be half as thick.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.360]   Get your camera to fit in it.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   And the engineers just work really hard for a year,
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   and they manage to do it.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.840]   And the next day, the design team says, we're going to make it half as thin again.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.360]   Get your camera to fit in that.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   And it's sort of like that same thing.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   You ran the lap in 100 seconds.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.200]   Can you do it in 50 seconds?
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.120]   And that's sort of high-performance people, as much as they hate that, they also love that.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.160]   It's interesting.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.360]   I'm trying to screw it around.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:49.000]   I'm going through a table of things and looking at what checkmarks have been put
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.320]   next to it, things that I should not be talking about publicly.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.680]   You can say typhoon now.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.200]   I can officially say typhoon today.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:04.840]   It would be interesting 30 years from now,
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.480]   when people have been retired from Apple for 20 years,
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.960]   to when just like the members of the original Mac team are now speaking completely freely
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.480]   and with great pride about all of the fights and all the struggles that
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.840]   outfitted and defined the original Macintosh,
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.760]   I would like to hear people who are working on the iPhone
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.120]   talk about getting those two millimeters thinner.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.680]   And if they actually thought, what a great design challenge,
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.440]   as opposed to, there is no reason for us to take two millimeters off.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.760]   And now you have totally screwed us over in these plans we had for the camera.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.040]   We had so many things we could have done, but now we can't do because
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.200]   someone decided that it has to be thinner no matter what.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:48.600]   So it's going to be interesting to hear those stories in 10 or 20 years time.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:54.680]   On the statute of limitations, when finally, not only Apple's robots of vengeance,
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.640]   their batteries have died out and now they're rusting on the surface,
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:03.000]   as we all live underground, but also the fear of the government that Apple morphed into in
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.720]   2141 has also collapsed. People can finally talk about actually designing Apple products
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.320]   and all the fights that happen inside.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.600]   I love that conversation I talked about previously when Don Milton and
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.000]   Ganatra talked about the discussions about whether to use AppKit or WebKit or what
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.040]   eventually became UIKit as the foundation for development on an eye.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.040]   That kind of stuff, it does eventually come out and regardless of where you fit on,
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.880]   in what your personal opinion is, hearing those discussions and knowing that they had
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.560]   those discussions and it's not all arbitrary and maybe it wasn't the best solution,
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.480]   but it was the best one that they had at the moment, I think is hugely educational,
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.920]   just for people who watch Apple now.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:42.040]   That's what happens in all levels of design. I can talk about a different phone manufacturer,
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.440]   where it had a similar problem, I am thinking specifically about the camera features,
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.960]   where they were just looking at different prototypes or looking at different things that they had
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:55.720]   built and they realized that we can either use this camera module, which takes okay pictures
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.760]   and will allow us to have that slim profile we're going for and they're trying specifically to
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:08.440]   ape the iPhone 4 or the 4S or we can swallow our pride, have a little bit of a bump up there and
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.880]   give this a really, really good picture taking hardware and they decided people are going to
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.960]   make fun of us for having a blister on the other side of our phone, but the people who own this
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:22.200]   will forget about that about 10 seconds after they see their first pictures out of this.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.960]   So it's the making of documentary behind almost anything when it's being designed by really
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.640]   creative people and almost everybody at that level is a highly creative person,
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:37.720]   fascinating stuff to watch. So speaking of creative people, I understand that Leo LePort has
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:42.200]   an additional segment he wants, additional product he wants to tell us about is something
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:48.040]   almost equally or every bit as amazing. Our show today, if you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.240]   and remind you our show today brought to you by Gazelle, you know about Gazelle, best place to buy,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:52:02.040]   yes buy and sell your old gadgets. They will buy certified pre-owned iPhones, Samsung Galaxy
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:10.600]   phones, iPads, Surface tablets, Kindles, whatever you've got, they'll buy it at a great price. They
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.720]   pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck. It's a great place to send your old device,
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.400]   but nowadays you got to think of it more as like a trade-in because they also sell devices,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:27.160]   the very best stuff that they get at Gazelle.com, they will sell at a really good price. Everything
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.480]   they sell is in one of two conditions, either certified like new. Usually that means somebody
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.640]   bought something and sold it back to Gazelle or sold to Gazelle because they just didn't want it,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.520]   they never used it. And that's a smart thing to do, it's crazy just to throw those things in a drawer
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:47.080]   and let them get dust. That's cash. So that's the like new, but they also do something called
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:51.640]   certified good. These were, these were devices, they were slightly worn, you know, little signs
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.760]   of wear, they're in great shape. In fact, Gazelle puts, they won't sell it if it's not 100%
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.400]   functionally, put every single device through their rigorous 30-point inspection. And of course,
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.120]   you have a 30-day risk-free guarantee, you can return it anytime in those first 30 days,
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:11.800]   get your money back. So you're not taking a risk, but you are saving a lot of money. If your kids
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.560]   lose or break their devices, if you lose or break your devices, this is a great way to replace it.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:24.760]   Gazelle, free shipping, fast processing, cash, PayPal credit, Amazon gift card, when you sell
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:31.560]   your device to Gazelle, but you can also buy. Gazelle is paid out nearly $200 million to over a million
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:37.640]   customers. And I'm one of them. I've sold a lot of stuff on Gazelle and I'm very happy they exist.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:44.200]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com, get that 30-day quote right now. And if you're looking to replace your existing
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.760]   device, you might check it out there too. Gazelle.com, back to Mac break weekly.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:59.080]   Thank you very much, Leo. So the new trailer for the new Steve Jobs movie is out. I've watched it
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:04.040]   several times. Maybe we could see a little bit of it just so that we're all on the same page for it.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:14.440]   [Music]
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:20.840]   What do you do? You're not an engineer. You're not a designer. You can't put a hammer to it.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.160]   It was never said. I built the circuit board. The graphical interface was stolen.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:31.000]   I saw it because a lot of things do. Ten times in a day. I read Steve Jobs as a genius.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   Why is the Green Hornet yelling at Magneto?
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:40.360]   I play the orchestra. Clearly you have not read the secret board event in Marvel.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.040]   Here from different segments of battle worlds come together for the first time.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.760]   You've been worse than usual this morning. I didn't think that was possible.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:52.680]   It's a system error. Fix it. Fix it? Yeah. We're not a pit crew at Daytona. This can't be fixed in seconds.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.560]   You didn't have seconds. You have three weeks. You and the person created in the third of that time.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.960]   Well someday you'll have to tell us how you did it.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.480]   I like that in the original movie. I love that one in 1776. Yes.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:03.720]   Yes.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:09.080]   You see how this reminds you of a friendly face? I'm surprised how that faces me. The creator.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:14.120]   The fighting and it needs to say hello. If you keep alienating people for no reason,
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.920]   there's been no one left for it to swallow. I still don't get him as was. It's still. It's still.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.400]   It's 41 million dollars. Well you don't get the-
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:21.880]   I don't get the-
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.120]   The one that is bad. I don't.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.800]   I love Aaron's working so much, but this movie looks so not Steve Jobs to me.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:35.720]   Yeah, I think it's a very poorly cut trailer, honestly. It's a very poorly cut trailer.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.840]   I love that. They're seen the scene with the glasses and the reflection of the devices.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.920]   The angry feeling is driving Steve Jobs the entire trailer. It's just pushing that button.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.040]   And I'll show you Apple.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.640]   Well the thing about trailers is that often it's cut together
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.200]   based on the footage they have available at that time.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   So that's why especially in science fiction movies where you see stuff that doesn't-
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.440]   it looks like crap with the first trailer because they only have like eight seconds of-
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.240]   The vise, yeah.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:55:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.520]   And it might be a similar thing going on here.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.840]   Here is what's available. Here's what's been color timed.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.280]   And here's what we're able to release right now.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.880]   The thing is if you're looking at it, go ahead Andy.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:16.680]   No, I'm gonna say it's gonna be hard for me to evaluate this because I'm attracted to things like
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:22.600]   I don't remember Steve Jobs in his bow tie days ever combing his hair backward like that
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.120]   and having moose in his hair. And I don't know that's a right thing to be distracted by.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.480]   No.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   I see this, yeah. Oh sorry Ashley.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.520]   No, sorry. I too was totally distracted by that.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.480]   One of the first- I watched it several times like I'm sure all of you.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.480]   And one of the first things I thought is like was looking like Steve Jobs a pre-req for
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.200]   getting this role because I just didn't see it.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:47.640]   Like I actually went back and looked at- looked up some of the pictures of Steve from those events.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.760]   And I just couldn't see the connection at all.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.720]   Like it looked like-
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.680]   How important is looking like him to you?
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.280]   To sort of like plan himself in this role of Steve Jobs.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   Because I was wondering because we know Steve Jobs,
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.640]   anyone who watches this show, or listens to the show knows Steve Jobs has seen them all the
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.920]   keynote performances. He has such presence. He is such a performer that, for example,
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.520]   when I watched the social network also written by Aaron Sorkin,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.640]   I know Mark Zuckerberg's public persona, but I'm nowhere nearly as invested in it.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.720]   And I don't know if I'd been covering Zuckerberg for years.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.640]   I'd be going, ah, I'm the way that sucker broke.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.160]   So I wonder how much of us that is.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.760]   That's exactly right. It's sort of like being from Boston.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:32.600]   And all you have to do is see a scene where you can't leave the public guard and go over a bridge
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.320]   and then be in Somerville. Come on, you people.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.760]   That's like, but nobody outside of Boston would even care about that.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.360]   And it's really not important to the movie.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.080]   It really comes down to- there's another movie coming out this summer,
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.440]   the Fantastic Four movie, where Michael Jordan is playing the Human Torch.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.200]   And he does not look in any way like the Human Torch that's been
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.120]   depicted in the comic book for 40 years.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.760]   But the thing is-
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.440]   Like Samuel Jackson is Nick Fury.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.320]   Exactly. But the thing is, you see him in the role and you forget all about it because your
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:07.880]   definition of the character warps around what the actor chooses to project if the actor is really,
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.880]   really good. So I'm not really worried about that. I'm just hoping that they get the tone right,
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:18.280]   that they don't come to Steve Jobs as this crying little baby and Steve
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:23.800]   Wozniak is this cross-legged, just bouncy hippie who doesn't care about anything and doesn't-
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.280]   It's like, you don't want the turn into Lego minifigures, which is what the
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.960]   previously jobs movie did, I think.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:34.120]   But the Fantastic Four and Shield, those are fictional characters and it feels like
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:40.440]   you can basically change that. I had a conversation with Georgia last week where we were talking about
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.560]   you could have easily made Pippin and Mary female in the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings movies
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:48.680]   if you wanted more gender diversity because they're fictional characters and you have
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:54.520]   license with those. But real people that we've seen, I don't know how much Morgan Freeman really
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:59:03.960]   looks like Nelson Mandela or how much Gandhi really looks like Ben Kingsley. But because I've seen
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.720]   Steve Jobs so often, I just look at Michael Fassbender and I see Magneto.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:16.120]   So for me, this movie is not- I think that in order for Sorkin to write this movie,
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.760]   and I think in the order for this movie to exist, especially given the fact that Steve Jobs,
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:26.680]   you know, his life and death was so recent and the fact that we've already seen a really terrible
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:33.400]   movie version of his life, I don't think that this film is designed to be a biography.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:38.040]   I mean, obviously it has biographical elements, but I really do feel like this is
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:48.760]   supposed to be the fictionally highlighted version of Steve. So the person on screen is not Steve
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:56.520]   Jobs the man that you may have met at Keynote's. This is the essence of Steve Jobs. If we were
[00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:02.280]   conscripted to write a movie about the essence of Steve and the-
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:10.360]   A myth and legend? Well, not even the myth and legends. I'm losing the word right now,
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.760]   but his essence, his being, you know, it's not necessarily about how he combed his hair. It's not
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:25.800]   necessarily about what he looks like on any given day. I think it's the rapport that you see between
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.960]   the people, the way that he interacts with technology, the way that he interacts with his company.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.640]   There are little bits in that trailer that make me think they're shooting for painting
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.440]   an abstract painting rather than trying to do like point to late specific images that will
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:50.600]   stand in your head. Like if you notice, almost like the trailer has hints of evocative images in
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.880]   it. Like you see the welcome to Macintosh presentation like in prep. You see Max everywhere, you see
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.800]   the Lisa, you see him working with his daughter. You never see-
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.000]   I'm getting tired of re-coming down behind him.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.280]   Yeah, but you never see photo like they'd unlike the original, the previous Steve Jobs movie,
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.400]   there are no photos or there are no recreations of historic moments in this trailer.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.560]   Like this is obviously a historic moment, but you don't see the same shot, right?
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.160]   They're showing sort of behind the scenes of that shot, but they're not actually being like,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:30.200]   this is Steve, this is the presentation, this is the moment. I don't know, it feels more behind
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.360]   the scenes, less snapshot and more just general emotion evocative.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.560]   Very errands-
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.520]   That even makes sense.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:46.280]   You've just defined a movie exactly. We don't pay $12 to go see a documentary
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.920]   of this nature. We want to understand more than reality can actually deliver to us.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.040]   And I think that a good version of this will do that. We were joking about 1776 earlier.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:01.480]   It is maybe 40% accurate as to how the Declaration of Independence was created and ratified.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   But the central truth of it, which was that it was a long,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.880]   fraud out process with a lot of arguments. And everybody who finally ratified it understood that
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.600]   if this goes wrong, everybody in this room is absolutely going to be hanged.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.000]   That's the central truth you can't get around, and that's what it delivers.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.640]   So on that basis, you understand that this is fiction, but you respect that at least it's
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.440]   honoring a central truth. So that's what we're hoping for with the Steve Jobs.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.080]   That's my big question is that I saw the imitation game and I knew that it wasn't
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.520]   factually the exact story, but it was a great movie. I didn't care.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.080]   Social network, the same thing. I knew it wasn't the story of Facebook,
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:41.160]   as was documented, but I didn't care. And I just worry that my own Apple investment will
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.520]   just keep intruding itself on my movie-going experience here.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.120]   Yes, exactly. I think there's something-
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:52.200]   I was just saying, I think there's something to that though, like with the imitation game or with
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.360]   the social network, it wasn't called Facebook. It wasn't called Mark Zuckerberg. This is called
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:02.200]   Steve Jobs. I think those details about his hair, the fact that we see hello on the Macintosh,
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.120]   the fact that we see the products and his glasses, we see the jeans and the black
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.280]   turtleneck as he's walking up to his daughter. The denial of his daughter and then
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:20.040]   going back on that, those details make it Steve Jobs. I think it's a little disingenuous to try
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:27.560]   to say that this is a movie that's based in fiction, but it's three major events that actually
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:35.320]   happened. And it's called Steve Jobs. If you want to say that it's a biography with-
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:41.720]   that's loose and made for Hollywood, sure, but maybe this will only matter to super Appleheads,
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.920]   but it just feels a little- you got to go all the way because those details are things that we
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:52.280]   love and we pay attention to and get us excited. It'll come across when we see the actual movie.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:58.040]   My opinion is that you are allowed to take a certain dramatic license, as long as you're being
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.800]   really, really clear that this is not a documentary. Some of the stuff has happened, some of the stuff
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.320]   didn't happen, some of the people in this movie exist, some of them we had to mush eight different
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.000]   people together because we need someone representing this point of view that was not expressed by one
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.640]   person at this meeting. I mean, angry was. Yeah, exactly. And the other problem that is certainly
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:24.520]   difficulty is that a lot of people might see the right stuff, which is a three hour movie from 1980
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:31.800]   about the Mercury Space program, and think that Gus Grissom freaked out when Liberty Bell seven
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.880]   splashdown, pull the emergency, the emergency explosive bolts on the door because he was scared
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.480]   and then caused the entire craft to sink when that completely did not happen. It was a controversy
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.960]   for about 10 seconds until it was proven that no, no, no, he can possibly have done that deliberately.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.360]   And now you don't you want to make sure the people who are not terribly interested in this
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:58.680]   believe in the fiction over believing in the actual provable fact. So that is a risk.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:05.000]   Yeah, well, so it's interesting to me because I actually recently saw one of one of Sorkin's
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.480]   recent plays, the Farnsworth invention, last week. And in that, I don't know if anybody knows
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.360]   sort of the history behind that, but the Farnsworth invention was a fiction, you know, semi, semi
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:25.480]   fictional, semi biographical story about a patent play between Farnsworth who rightfully invented
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:34.600]   television and the big wigs at RCA. And the end of that play actually has, there's a patent trial,
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:40.440]   basically, and the end of the play awards the patent of the creation of television to RCA,
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:47.480]   when in fact, in reality, the patent was awarded to Farnsworth and not actually to RCA, but there
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.440]   was a there was a big long drawn out battle. And the results of which, even though Farnsworth
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:57.320]   won the patent, it was after like 15 years and he'd become a drunk and he basically, you know,
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:04.600]   died in a in an asylum. And so Sorkin took that event and condensed it into, well, I'm just going
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.880]   to say that RCA won because it has the same kind of desired effect without me having to show 15
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:17.720]   years of patent trials on a stage. So that's, I feel like that's an interesting way to look at
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:24.280]   the way that Sorkin adapts material, especially biographical material, in that he's not,
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:31.160]   I don't think he's necessarily interested in capturing what's 100, 110% true to life and what
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.520]   actually happened with a bullet point and an exclamation mark. I think he's more interested in
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.720]   telling the story and having the through line. And I don't necessarily know whether that makes for a
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.840]   good, where whether it makes for a good story, whether it makes for good history. You know,
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.400]   there are people who might come and watch this movie who might not know much about Steve Jobs
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.240]   other than that guy who found it Apple. And maybe it, maybe this movie will do a disservice to
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.280]   people who want to learn about Steve Jobs, or maybe it will capture the essence of who Steve Jobs is
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:07.560]   if those people want to learn more about him. I just, I feel like it's really hard to judge
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.880]   based on the trailer. There are images in the trailer that I really like though. I'm excited
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   about the cinematography, if nothing else. It's also a different viewership today than the right
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.280]   stuff had 1980 1980. Again, you're not, let's say you're not terribly interested in the space
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.000]   program and you see this movie that's fictionalizes the Mercury program. You might go home saying,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.680]   Oh, well, I guess, well, too bad about Liberty Bell seven. I guess there's a reason why that guy
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.400]   was never trusted again. Yes, he was he flew. It was on Apollo one. He was so well trusted.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:40.360]   But now if people come home after seeing the Steve Jobs movie, they can, before the, before the,
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.280]   while they're in the parking lot, they can get off their phones and Google information about
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.480]   Steve Jobs and get information about it. And there's certainly going to be people like us who are
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:52.200]   going to write about here is, I was at that event or I was around at that event. Here's what I recall
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.640]   this different from this. And here's what they got right and who's, here's what they got wrong. So,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.200]   the movie doesn't have to carry the entire story to the extent that it had to like in 1980.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.960]   It's got Bondi blue all the way to the ground, much like ourselves.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.280]   All right. So, the big topic, the one that I've been saving for last because I know
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:15.080]   Srenity at the very least has a lot to say about this. And I'm sure all of us do. But
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:21.960]   we've had about a week now to work on Apple music and beats one and explore it and learn about it
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.360]   and be told that it's filling up our catalogs with all sorts of nasty DRM. Is that correct, Ren?
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:33.640]   Oh boy. Well, no, it's not filling up your Mac with DRM.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.120]   So the TLDR, the too long didn't read version of this, is essentially Apple music is a music
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:50.040]   subscription service, which means that all of those tracks live in the cloud where you can
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.560]   download them if you're a subscriber to any one of your devices and listen to them offline.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.480]   Because if you had a subscription service where you couldn't actually bring your music with you,
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:06.200]   kind of stink. So you can download these files and bring them offline. But if you ever cancel
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.280]   your subscription, you don't get to keep them. That seems to make straightforward sense. No
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:15.800]   one's arguing over that. Most subscription services have DRM, which is just, you know,
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:21.960]   you either play it on one of Apple's devices, one of Google's apps, one of Amazon's apps,
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.520]   or you don't get to play the subscription service. Fine. That's not unusual.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:33.960]   The tricky part here is that Apple Music also incorporates elements of Apple's iTunes match
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:40.120]   service, which allows you to upload the library from your Mac or from any one of your Macs
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:47.640]   and store it alongside these subscription music files. So say I have four Taylor Swift songs from
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:56.520]   1989, those songs get put in my iCloud music library next to Taylor Swift's giant streaming catalog.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:05.800]   Now, here's the super tricky part is that when you upload your music library to iCloud
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:13.000]   music library to host it in iCloud music library, Apple only uploads tracks that it doesn't have in
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.440]   its catalog. So if it looks at your thing and is like, oh, you have a custom, a couple of
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.880]   Mac weekly recordings, I don't have this in my Apple music streaming catalog. So I'm just going
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:30.920]   to upload these recordings as is as iTunes song files, where they can be redownloaded to another
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   device as MP3s, however you uploaded them. But those Taylor Swift songs that I have, let's say I
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.360]   bought those off of Amazon, when it connects to the server, it says, oh, we have that album,
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:49.720]   we have 1989 on our Apple music service. So we're going to match those tracks that you have locally
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.880]   on your device, on your Mac, we're going to match them in iCloud music library so that when you
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:02.040]   redownload them on another device, you're getting Apple music's version of those tracks. Apple does
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:08.280]   this in part to save space and save you upload time, but also in part because you might be, you
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.000]   might have a track that's not quite as good quality. So I want to offer you really good quality when
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.360]   you're listening on other devices. However, because it's matching those songs with the Apple music
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:24.440]   catalog, that means that any redownload or any download you do to an auxiliary device will have
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.720]   the Apple music DRM on it. And that's where people are getting into a Tizzy because iTunes match does
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:35.080]   not have DRM. iTunes match does the same thing that uploading and matching service to allow you to
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:41.000]   have your songs on any one of your devices. But when you redownload, it's actually linking to the
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.120]   iTunes store catalog rather than the Apple music catalog. So when you redownload, you're getting a
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.560]   DRM-free track from the iTunes store if that track is matched. With Apple music, you're downloading
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:57.960]   from the streaming catalog. So you're getting a DRM streaming song. So the people who are really
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:03.640]   running into issues here, the reason why this became such a big deal is that when iTunes match
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:10.920]   came out, people quickly realized that you can upload your Mac's music library to iTunes match,
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:17.000]   delete your low quality files that you may have ripped off of CDs 10 years ago or gotten off of
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.760]   Napster, and redownload them from the iTunes store. And hey, now I have high quality tracks on my Mac,
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.200]   or I don't need to store all of these files on my Mac. I can just store it in iCloud and it's no
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:34.600]   problem. And they delete their entire Mac music library and just rely on iCloud. And that A is
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.960]   really dumb idea. You need a backup. I'm sorry. You can't rely on the cloud. But B, it's getting
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.520]   these people into trouble because they sign up for Apple music and they may still be match
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:51.240]   subscribers. But when they sign up for Apple music, there's a bug right now where if you're
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:57.880]   an iTunes music and an iTunes match subscriber, occasionally when you look at an auxiliary device,
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:03.400]   or if you look at your main Mac and you have songs that you've deleted, it might show up as Apple music
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:09.480]   as an Apple music track rather than an iTunes match track connected to the iTunes store catalog.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.280]   And that's gotten people up and it's easy. Oh no, Apple's putting DRM on my Mac. How
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.880]   dare they? And the answer is no, Apple is not DRMming songs you already own and have downloaded.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:26.440]   It's if you are subscribed to Apple music, it's trying to match them with the streaming catalog,
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:34.040]   which happens to have DRM. It's not unusual. The issue is that Apple did not publicize this
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.040]   in any way. When they were talking about the differences between iTunes match and Apple music,
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:44.120]   it was their complimentary, how their complimentary were not going to tell you. They're essentially
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:51.560]   the same service except one has DRM free and one has DRM. And Apple was very hush-hush about
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.440]   this in part because I think they just don't want to talk about DRM. So that is the slightly long,
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:01.480]   but very convoluted, but valid thing about why people are mad right now.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.360]   I think I'm really appreciative that you actually took the time to figure this out because like
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.120]   you said, no one provided this information. This was a result of you spending a couple days
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.440]   hammering out and figuring out what happened. But it is super complicated because you can have
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.000]   stuff that you acquired from outside of iTunes, stuff you acquired on iTunes, stuff that is iTunes
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.680]   match, stuff that is from Apple music, stuff that you've downloaded locally, stuff that you're
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.560]   streaming. And that's an incredible level of complexity. And if it takes tech journalists days
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.480]   to figure this stuff out, I can't even imagine what just a person trying to listen to their music has
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:38.120]   to go through. Yeah, and that concerns me a lot. I will say that the majority of people, at least
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.600]   the major complaints that I've been seeing about Apple music and about DRM and all of that,
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:48.840]   it's largely techies who have match and who have done crazy things like deleted their entire
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:56.920]   library off one computer. I feel like the vast majority of users, they're not going to notice it
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.600]   because again, Apple wants to wash it. Apple wants to do everything before you.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.680]   It all happens behind the curtain pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.960]   On the average user probably has their iTunes music library locally on their Mac, on their one
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.840]   Mac, and then when they turn on Apple music, oh, hey, all of a sudden they have all of that music on
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.720]   their iPhone and their iPad too. That's really cool. And then if they cancel their Apple music
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.680]   subscription, oh, that music went away on my iPhone and my iPad. Well, I guess that makes sense
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.800]   because I don't have the subscription anymore. I feel like the average user would never have
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:38.440]   subscribed to iTunes match. iTunes match subscriptions I think are still fairly small in the grand scheme
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:44.760]   of things. The average user doesn't really, they care about DRM when we publicize it and we're like
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:51.160]   DRM, DRM, DRM, be scared for your files. In fact, there were a couple people who were very inflammatory
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:56.920]   articles that were very much like, oh, Apple is labeling all of your songs with DRM, like not
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.320]   actually bothering to look into the like looking into what was actually going on. They just heard
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.760]   the DRM word like the D word and was like, ah, we've got to let everybody know that all of your
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:15.480]   music is doomed. No, doomed. No, no, I mean, it's still frustrating, but I had it for your piece
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.760]   or anything. It clearly explained things that I didn't know I had questions about, especially
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:26.920]   iTunes match. I never knew what iTunes match actually was for. So if nothing else, I thought
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:33.480]   you really articulated those points very clearly. And you know, technology in general, especially
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.520]   the Apple's supposed to be one of the platforms that's seamless, right? That sort of just makes
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:42.280]   sense and is intuitive and understandable. And you know, I just got back from visiting my parents
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.960]   and family and nobody still knows how to use these things. My mom just recently bought a paper
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.320]   calendar because she doesn't know how to choose an iPhone 6 Plus. She has no idea how to use
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:57.800]   calendar app on her phone. And it scares me that the more conveniences we make and the more abstractions
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.680]   we create, it's still a confusing proposition to try to bring people on board and to bring the
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.280]   Apple store and took a free course to learn how to use the calendar. So I mean, that kind of
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.120]   stuff is an option, but it's kind of crazy that kind of stuff is an option. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:20.520]   I hadn't I hadn't experienced over the weekend. And it's I was before I knew that before upgrading
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:25.240]   to the desktop version of the new iTunes with Apple music, I wanted to make sure that I had a
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.360]   backup of all of my local files. I had read I had read some Chinese piece, but it's always
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.560]   there's there's there's no question to which the the answer, what if I make another backup just in
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.200]   case is the wrong answer? It's not nothing bad will happen because you made a superfluous backup
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:46.520]   of all your data. And that's when I found out for the first time since October, my actual music
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:52.840]   library is not on my hard drive. It is all I iTunes match. Because for reasons that would be way too
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.960]   long to explain I had I ran out of space on the SSD inside my new MacBook and decided I'm going
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:01.720]   to basically plug in an external SSD that would handle all my libraries on my music and photo
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:08.120]   libraries. And I'm I'm not incapable of doing stupid things, but I'm probably not really dumb
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:13.800]   when it comes to this stuff. And I was absolutely certain that copy the entire library off of the
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.520]   internal drive and onto the external drive and set that as the new library turns out that didn't
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.400]   happen at all didn't discover that until I explicitly tried to go and look to see where are my music
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:28.120]   files and why is this folder not as big as I expected it to be. And so had I gone on
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.680]   had I gone onward and just simply clicked the button click the button that all apples ads is
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:37.080]   telling me to do. Oh, new iTunes music, new iTunes music. I could have got myself in really big
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.760]   trouble. It would have been very stupid to deliberately say I'm going to delete all my music off of my
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:47.400]   hard drive, but I managed to act to do so without knowing that I had done so. And it's I don't know
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.760]   how many people are actually using iTunes match. But remember that this wasn't this little
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.360]   thing feature that you would find if you looked in the right techno. This was something that Apple
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.600]   was promoting as here's another reason why you don't need to have we can still sell the iPhone
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   with 1.2 gigabytes of storage because you don't store anything on a phone you silly goose you're
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.560]   going to put it all in the cloud. Don't worry about it. We've got we're doing all the thinking for you.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.440]   So there's there's there's a great complexity to all of this sort of stuff that we're we're often
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:18.920]   immune to and ignorant of. And if it's there's there's no excuse for saying that Apple applied
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:25.320]   DRM to all my music files without actually, you know, it's it's it's it's it's it's a labor
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.000]   intensive if you're a journalist, but you can figure these things out. All you have to do is be
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.400]   somebody who cares about your job like Serenity does. And you can actually do this stuff. But
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.840]   nonetheless, I don't and I'm really, really concerned about people who assume that everything
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.960]   just works and everything that they think is true is actually true. And I don't know that there's a
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.240]   really good solution to that. But all I know is that I'm really, really glad that I have another
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.360]   backup somewhere before the last backup I did of this machine before I tinkered with it. And
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:59.320]   that now I have another hard drive so I can before I upgrade to the new Apple music, I can just do
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.560]   iTunes match and simply say download everything you got from the cloud and put it into this new
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:08.920]   volume and then unplug it and put it in a damn drawer where iTunes and Apple cloud services can
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:15.000]   never find it. I mean, the last thing is maybe maybe it's it's good to have a poll of the panel.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.440]   Is there anybody who just implicitly trusts that if Apple has a cloud service that it will work
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:29.400]   great? Do they do you trust it? I trust Dropbox. I trust the
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:37.720]   verify. Yeah, I will it's funny, right? I have gotten closer to trusting Apple, which is to say
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   that I have my photos in iCloud photo library, which is something that I was never comfortable
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.840]   really doing with iCloud sharing or anything like that. And I actually have all of them in
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:56.280]   the photos app on OS 10 and that actually feels okay. And I've been using match since it premiered
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:03.400]   in 2011 and I have by and large, I'm I guess one of the few people who have who've had no problems
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:09.640]   with match matches worked perfectly for me. But I also I have a library that's under 25,000 songs.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:14.120]   I don't have any crazy classical music tracks and I haven't tried to do anything too zany with it.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:21.000]   I have a I have all of my tracks on my iMac and then I have all of my tracks in the cloud for my
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.600]   Mac book air and then maybe like one or two albums stored locally. So I feel like I trust I trust
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:35.640]   Apple's cloud services to a certain extent. I don't trust that they will be perfect. I know that
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:41.240]   there are bugs. I know that there were workarounds that I'm going to have to deal with. But I also
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:48.040]   trust that they are that they are committed to making it better because I was I've been a member
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:56.840]   of you know iCloud back when it was called iTools in like the early 2000s like 90s. I don't even
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:02.360]   remember when iCloud or when iTools premiered. But you know I've I've been with the Mac cloud
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:11.880]   machine for a very long time. And I like I've seen how much it's improved. And so I'm I'm
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.240]   reluctant to say that I don't trust it because I do I use a lot I use a lot of Apple services and
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:25.160]   I use them with varying degrees of success mostly. I mean like 97% success rate on on Apple's cloud
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:32.520]   services. But I know that I am more likely an exception to the role than the actual role because
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:38.520]   I know a lot of people who do have problems with Apple's cloud services. I trust but verify I have
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.920]   everything just I have everything in the cloud on the local then backed up on time machine and
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:49.160]   often super duper as well. So I'm one of those. So yeah, I think from a security no sorry I think
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:55.880]   from a security perspective more or less trust Apple as any sinking cloud service which is
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:02.520]   means with great trepidation. But it's hard to I guess have confidence in the reliability of the
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:08.680]   sinking when like I open notes and I have duplicates of all my notes and I know or reminders so
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.800]   and I know that those are probably like low priority products for Apple given sort of
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:21.320]   they're them being in the hardware business and those being free apps but it as a consumer it's
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.720]   hard not to like put or see them all as sort of like cloud sinking services and so it's like if
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:30.280]   you can't get this right how you're gonna get this other thing right. Yeah, I had a bug where it was
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.000]   duplicating all my notes and I turned off I left iCloud note sinking on turned off Google notes
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.240]   thinking and it appeared to start working but that kind of stuff is also non-intuitive to
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:45.880]   sort of to sort of figure out. On the same bent there was a post from Dave Whiskis who I think is at
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:52.200]   least is a friend of many of ours on this panel and he is a musician as well as a iOS app designer
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.720]   and his band Airplane Mode wanted to try the new connect features and they wanted to share
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.520]   some music they're experimenting with and he detailed the process of trying to do that through
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:07.160]   the music app. Apple has released a garage band update on iOS that has sort of
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.480]   connect sharing built in and they're gonna update the OS 10 version of that but Dave kind of do it
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.920]   through the music app he had a lot of problems including having to add a space to be able to
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:20.040]   edit something and not being sure what was permanent what wasn't permanent to Apple's credit Trent
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:26.760]   Reznor saw the post and replied to him within a day which is I think really responsive compared
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:32.920]   to the traditional Apple approach and Eddy Q has been twittering a lot more in the last couple weeks
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:38.840]   than he has in the last couple of years maybe saying for example home sharing would be coming
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:45.880]   back in iOS 9 but Andy does is this sort of to be expected when a new product launches should
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:50.040]   they be held to a higher standard are they being response is being responsive good or should they
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:56.680]   not need to be this responsive. I think if if if my mother had a cloud service I wouldn't trust
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.560]   it immediately I would ask her a lot of questions about where things were things store and I would
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.320]   still do a backup before flipping that switch that said I seem to have a lot of problems with
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:13.000]   Apple's cloud services that I don't have with other services. Microsoft's OneDrive has been
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.840]   really really rock solid reliable for me as I said about Dropbox I've every time that I trusted
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:23.720]   to do something it does exactly what I expected what I asked it to do asked exactly what I what
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.920]   I trusted it to do and it didn't screw anything up on me and I think the difference between those two
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.840]   is that Apple is very the strength all of the things they do that's great and many of the things
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:40.520]   that they do that is not doesn't turn out great is result of saying to the user don't worry about
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:44.520]   it we got this don't you don't understand anything just flip the switch we will hand everything
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:51.160]   handle everything and maybe part of that responsibility is on us as users because you know it's possible
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.960]   to simply say don't even bother lifting the hood of your car you never need to know anything
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.720]   about how this car works yeah but if you understand that there are belts that drive things and hoses
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.320]   that deliver fluids from one place to another and there's this thing called an alternator that
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.960]   keeps generating electricity you will be able to spot problems on your own and prevent yourself
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.360]   from being stranded in the middle of nowhere with no cell service at 2 a.m. someplace so maybe
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:20.600]   there's some some blame to be spread around but I do think that Apple has to build trust with the
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.000]   larger community with their cloud services at this point but to answer your question you know nothing
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.680]   on week one is going to be perfect and it's interesting because iTunes 12.2 did land and
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.720]   there was some sort of hope that maybe Apple would do something different that maybe we would
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:41.160]   get a bigger update I think 12.2 being circulated widely before the update sort of lessened those
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:47.400]   those hopes but some people were hoping maybe for a separate music app like iOS on some people were
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:52.280]   maybe hoping that there would be a redesign that made all this stuff simpler but iTunes still has
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.960]   to be ported to Windows it still has to sync all those legacy iPod devices some people still use it
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:03.400]   for modern iOS devices as well it's got so many conflicting masters and when it did land it sort
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.840]   of had music added on top of everything else and I know it's trying to you did oppose today
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:14.520]   trying to help people find out how to turn iTunes match back on or turn on for the first time in
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:21.160]   an Apple music world is Peter Cohen we work with wrote sort of a screed about the state of iTunes now
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:31.640]   how are you finding it oh gosh you know iTunes is better than it was I like I tuned 12.2 better
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:37.400]   than than it's than its predecessor but it's still buggy there's somebody on Twitter I forget whom
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.960]   who is speculating that perhaps this was a last-minute rush release of just a iTunes
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:49.720]   tack on and they had originally planned to release an all-new music app but just didn't have the time
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:55.240]   and I would agree with that yeah I would definitely agree with that because iTunes
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.880]   iTunes has been big and bloated and buggy for a long time but it feels especially
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:06.360]   bloated right now with the radio and the music tabs it doesn't quite work the way that the music
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:13.960]   app on iOS works certain things are majorly buggy playlists for example you can't like adding
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.320]   playlists just doesn't work on the Mac like certain adding certain songs just doesn't work
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:27.480]   the fact that you know that you can't listen to beats one via airplay on OS 10 but you can on iOS
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:35.800]   they're just they're a lot of like really weird strange bugs so yeah I mean new icon that's nice
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:42.440]   I really expect this to be called music when El Capitan comes out in the fall and I expect it
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.320]   to be a redesign program. It's interesting Ashley Peter noticed that you know there's
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   for you and my music there's radio and Apple sorry and Beats radio there's a new and recently
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.280]   added there's there seems to be just from a basic UX point of view a lot of things that aren't
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.920]   duplicative but might seem that way or aren't or should be complementary but seem more confusing
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:18.200]   right now. I lost everybody with that. I thought they're asking Ashley sorry.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:25.160]   Sorry were you asking me? Yeah no absolutely no I agree it's definitely a little bit of a
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.400]   confusing interface. I did think setting up the music app though was kind of cool with the bubbles
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:36.040]   and you can sort of tap a bubble to uncover her or I guess selecting sort of like what music
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:41.000]   you prefer and what Apple should start recommending you and then what genres I thought that process
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.520]   was kind of cool but the rest of it like you said is a little bit confusing it's like oh there's
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.480]   my Beats 1 radio station but then also I can have radio stations catered to a specific artist.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:54.760]   I thought one of the cooler things though is the fact that I think music is a little bit easier to
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:00.520]   access so purchased music if it's not already downloaded on your phone it's kind of like seamlessly
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:04.440]   shown which maybe some people wouldn't like but I thought it was kind of cool that it was sort of
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.760]   seamlessly shown with music that's also already downloaded and then you could choose to sort of
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.760]   make it offline or not but but all of the music was available to you to stream. I don't know what
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:19.720]   that's going to do to people's data to people's data on their on their cellular plans but I thought
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.240]   it made it a little bit easier to surface that because typically it's like it was buried in like
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.760]   several menus to get to music that you hadn't already put on your device but was purchased.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.960]   You weren't here last week so what do you think in general about Apple music and beats so always
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:38.840]   on 24/7 breaking worldwide? We try it. Are you enjoying it?
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.360]   I used to love the radio and so I think that's probably the most exciting thing. It's been funny
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:47.480]   to watch people sort of listen to the radio communally on Twitter and then talk about what
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:54.440]   they're listening to at the same time. Beyond that no it's it's more I guess we'll see over time
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:59.000]   right now it feels like a fun gimmick that's sort of pulling people in. What about you Ren
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:06.760]   how is Apple music a week later? I'm really enjoying it. I love Beats One. I listened to Elton John's
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:11.960]   Rocket Hour this morning which is now in a three-way tie for my favorite segmented show
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:23.160]   with St. Vincent's and with the alligator hour with Josh Home. It's really fun. I am really digging
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:28.680]   the Siri integration and just being able to be like Siri play more like this. Siri add this to
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:36.520]   my music library. Siri play the top song. Siri play motion city soundtrack. It's so much easier
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:40.600]   to navigate in the car and I want to write a piece about this at some point but just in car
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:47.880]   navigation has especially for streaming music has been improved a million fold with the integration
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:54.760]   of Siri into Apple music. It's just awesome. So I'm really digging it. Yeah I'm really digging it
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:59.800]   aside from aside from the crazy matches use but I'm not happy like again this is something I
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.680]   kind of had to dig through and try and recreate because I'm not actually having any of the match
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:09.480]   music issues. All of my tracks show up as matched. The Siri thing is interesting though we had some
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:14.520]   people complaining that in order to use Siri to do things like add more of this or play after this
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.480]   you have to actually interrupt what you're doing right now. So you're loving the music
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:21.400]   you're listening to but to get more of it you have to momentarily stop it talk to Siri and then
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.240]   let it keep going instead of I don't know what else Apple could do for that situation but it does
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:31.720]   seem interesting. So you know I actually kind of hope that they end up doing what they do for the
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:37.240]   watch which is that you know if you have music playing on your phone you can still use Siri on
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:41.400]   your watch and it actually doesn't interrupt the music on your phone. I think it would be really
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:47.400]   cool when Siri is triggered if you have music playing to just dim it so that obviously like if
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.760]   it's coming out of the same speakers that your microphone is coming out of maybe you need to
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:57.480]   you know just cut it entirely maybe that's maybe that's necessary for the microphone to
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:01.560]   properly pick up what you're saying but if they're going through external speakers I would it would
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:05.320]   be really cool to just dim it and and just let Siri listen to your voice.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:11.400]   Yeah I think that's absolutely true and the commands that they have added the ability to integrate
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:16.440]   with Apple music when you can just say things like add this to my up next cue or find me more artists
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.280]   like this. I think Siri is the only way you can actually shuffle everything that you're listening
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:26.360]   to right now. It has become super powerful and it's just it's one more argument for Siri becoming
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.000]   that sort of adjacent interface and I know you've spoken about this before Andy but and Amazon is
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:38.120]   doing this with Echo but the idea for having this on a Apple TV update or more pervasively
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.200]   throughout Apple's ecosystem gets even more interesting when it's got cloud integration like this.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.240]   Yeah and actually I think the killer app for this is just the ability to have an absolute always
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:53.720]   on microphone. I would spend after my experience with Amazon Echo last week and I was I've been
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:59.560]   sort of spending alternating evenings listening to Apple music and listening to my Amazon library
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:06.120]   through my iPhone and then through Amazon Echo and I really very much preferred using the Echo
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.840]   because you're just I'm just sitting on the sofa I've got a book in my lap or I got the laptop in my
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:17.160]   lap. The ability to simply call out a playlist and it goes and just simply lift up my head
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:24.200]   marginally and then say Alexa next because there's there's a there's a seven-minute long thing that
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.920]   I'm going to run into. It's a different thing when you have to reach to the coffee table pick up your
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:34.200]   phone and then say hey Shlomo next or you have to raise something up to your wrist your wrist up
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:40.120]   to your face and give a command. If Apple were to come out with just a Bluetooth speaker with a
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:47.560]   really good omnidirectional microphone that has direction awareness and the ability to not have to
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:54.360]   mute music in order to accept a command that would so totally enhance Siri a hundred times
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.320]   particularly when it comes to listening to music is you know you're even though this is a playlist
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:05.080]   you put together yourself you're just not either you forgot that this is the one where Tony Bennett
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:09.800]   starts off by introducing all the members of the band before getting to the song
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:16.200]   and you're just not in a mood to hear two minutes of and now my piano is for over 14 years mr elton
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.600]   like okay thank you very much you want to go to the next next track now so I've been having a good
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:27.240]   time with Apple music I have to say that I'm a little more eager to see advances in the apps
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:34.600]   than in the content I'm more eager than ever to see Apple just break iTunes app or the music app into
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:42.120]   several pieces now and have one app on Mac OS that is just for iOS thinking one app that is just for
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.880]   music devices and just make sure you have instead of having this tabbed experience that is getting
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.760]   more and more like Microsoft Office every single day and oh my god I'm supposed to be listening to
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:59.000]   and enjoying music not thinking about a multi-plane spreadsheet every time I want to access my albums
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.040]   I do think that's time for them to make a special interface for each thing they're going to do
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.840]   and break those up in a separate apps now a friend of the show Adam Anxt was asking about he said he
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.400]   likes beats radio overall but every once in a while a song comes up that he just he just can't stand
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:17.640]   doesn't want to listen to and he would like either a command that says mute and then start playing
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.880]   again as soon as that song's over or some way for it to play another song that it's of similar
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.760]   length and then notify him or automatically go back to beats radio yeah maybe maybe a sandman sims
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:32.680]   option we're just here this music strike up then just the sound of like a clown coming up on the
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.320]   stage with a big broom and just swatting Elton John or whatever on the behind so that's that I mean
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.000]   that's exactly it I do I think the beats one is a much better station than I thought was going
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.200]   to beats with a sto eclectic but yeah it's like I would much rather listen to nothing than listen
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.880]   to the rest of this song so already do we need a beats two for classical beats three or country
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:58.920]   does this thing scale um you know I do think it's interesting that it's called beats one a la bbc one
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:08.360]   bbc radio one um I think that eventually we might see a splinter right like assuming that this is
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.840]   successful and assuming they can figure out a way to make money off of it other than just having
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.440]   these little sponsor sips or that assuming that apple music is paying for it I think we might see
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:27.400]   a radio like sub sub genres um but I'm but I'm not necessarily sure if it'll be off of the main 24/7
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.880]   station or whether they'll just be regular recurring programs I am sad that we haven't seen a classical
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:41.080]   program we've seen most of the most of the modern music of this era but we haven't really seen a lot
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.480]   of blues we haven't seen a lot of jazz we haven't seen any true classical we haven't seen any musicals
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:51.000]   so it would be interesting to to get that although I will say that Zainlou played a
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:58.600]   a track from a really obscure Broadway musical um with it the track was called zombie and it was
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:04.840]   very very bizarre and awesome and totally unexpected I was listening to one of his playlists after
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.640]   the show had already aired and that was the last song I was just like what is this what have I
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.840]   just listened to and I'm like oh it's a Broadway musical okay that makes sense so they are like
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:22.600]   integrating some stuff into their into their shows it's just I would love to hear some like an hour
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.600]   dedicated to classical music yeah there's definitely I think there's definitely a first things first
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.920]   sort of attitude especially when you're telling it what your music will taste our with those with
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:36.840]   those bubbles at the beginning because most I would say half of or to even three quarters my music
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:44.520]   is classical and opera and Broadway and jazz and there's it really is like going to the mall store
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   where all classical right we got four of those CDs we've got the placidow Domingo and we've got
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.080]   hooked on classics and then I can't remember then we're on a stock on the other two I just
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.800]   remember after going through like pushing all the bubbles there is such fine when I when I push
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:05.000]   the bubble for I like alt rock a million bubbles popped up to be specific say well no I do like
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:15.560]   classical there's do you like uh Leonard Bernstein sure okay do you like we got nothing and the
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:20.200]   and the recommendations that it's making for the stuff are also not fine grained um I bet that
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:24.120]   within six or seven months it's going to come up with better suggestions for people who are not
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:31.160]   necessarily at the middle of musical tastes uh to go back to um like the apple tv prognostication
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.920]   stuff before there there was the apple tv is still being developed now that you have not
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:41.000]   released apple music for the apple tv yet that is still uh pending update but they did release
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.520]   uh showtime online so if you are in the us of a you can subscribe to showtime I think it's 10 or
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:53.240]   11 dollars and that goes along with things like HBO now which is uh a similar subscription service
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:58.760]   uh senator is there any appeal to you for showtime versus HBO versus the traditional ways of getting
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:07.880]   the stuff HBO is only appealing to me right now uh because I watch certain shows that are on HBO
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:12.040]   showtime I assume would be appealing to me if I was watching showtime shows currently I'm not
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:20.680]   but yeah I uh I would much rather subscribe on a per channel basis than subscribe to a bulk thing
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:26.280]   because the beauty of these the beauty of these one-off subscription programs is that unlike you
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:32.360]   know if I subscribe to charter or Comcast or Fios or any of those I'm committing to like a year long
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:38.680]   or two year long commitment of like god knows how many channels and all of this you know all of
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:46.120]   this on my television and a big giant box um whereas with these one-offs I oh I want to watch
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.560]   game of thrones for three months okay I subscribe to HBO now for three months and then I end my
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:56.920]   subscription I end my hulu subscription I start my showtime subscription I end my showtime subscription
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.840]   it's this and it's as easy as that and so if I don't you know I'm not paying for 12 months
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:07.240]   something that I am really only watching for two or three and I like that I think that's a it's a
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.920]   nice option it might be more a la carte that it is as a bundle um in the long term but if you're
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.840]   paying this sort of month to month I I feel like it's the better option yeah that's my concern
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.320]   because if you're paying 10 bucks for HBO 10 bucks for Netflix 10 bucks for showtime
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:29.240]   especially Netflix sorry especially Showtime and HBO that's 20 dollars just for two channels and I
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.480]   know a video try on here in Quebec is an exception but we were paying 20 dollars for 20 channels
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.960]   a la carte and 30 dollars for 30 channels off a la carte and I'm sure it's more expensive now but
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.520]   that was years ago but and yet I don't know how well this model scales if if you start wanting
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:48.040]   10 channels is that a hundred dollars plus other subscriptions or is that where the much rumored
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:54.680]   Apple service sort of comes into play yeah that is difficult it's it's hard to tell it's hard to
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.800]   tell somebody that uh well here here are your two options you can either buy HBO and showtime
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:06.360]   all a carte as these apps and pay about 15 dollars a month or you can get it through your cable provider
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:13.480]   and pay roughly the same amount of money per month oh but with if you buy it all a cart you can get
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:19.000]   it through pretty you can get on your iPad with any sort of app which I agree that you can also
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.760]   download the HBO app and if you just log in with your subscriber information trust us it's going to
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:30.920]   be awesome but I think that there I think it's the the win of it is more along the lines of what
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.880]   Serenid was talking about that there are a lot of people who either a don't want to have that sort
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.280]   of commitment to subscribe to something month after month after month when they really just
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:46.920]   want it for a few months just to watch this one series or they're not they don't own the cable box
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.480]   in the house where they live so they want to basically have their own HBO that they can
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:57.800]   they can take with them wherever they go uh it's been what three years since uh since the Steve Jobs
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:03.160]   book claimed that Steve Jobs has quote solved some quote finally the problem of television and I still
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:10.440]   have no idea what they're referring to uh I mean my my dream would be a service where it's just a
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.720]   random indiscriminate box I can buy whatever combination channels I want my fantasy is not the
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:22.200]   ability to buy Showtime all a cart it's the ability to get Turner Classic movies or BBC America or
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:28.920]   again I'm paying for 400 channels because there are six that I actually like and sling tv is getting
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.240]   better I'm a matter of fact sling tv just got Turner Classic movies but even they're starting to
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:39.160]   like package things and I keep hitting my hitting my head against that exact same wall saying so I'm
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:45.400]   going to cancel my cable subscription package for these channels so that I can then pay roughly the
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:51.240]   same amount of money for all the cart access to these channels and I will not be able to get access to
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:57.640]   that that two times a year when I'm actually I've when you know there's there's women's there's women's
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.520]   women's uh World Cup soccer and I can actually see the preliminary games on this really obscure
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:07.720]   sparks channel I need to be able to get access to that like once every four years so it's a it's a
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:12.440]   hard sell isn't it and it feels like Jobs's last theorem where like he's just scribbled in the
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:17.480]   margins of the Walter Isaacson's biography I crack this and we'll just never know what it is
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:21.480]   maybe that maybe that was like out of his plans for the last week say
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:25.640]   everything calling a different like reporter and say and also
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:31.960]   transport faster than light travel colonizing Mars we finally cracked it
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:40.040]   I'll tell you all about it next month so wrong uh the great tease uh so the last thing I wanted
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.680]   to talk about before we get to the of the of uh Pics of the Week is an article by Ben Beherin
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.720]   who's um very well known Apple analyst and he was one of the people who did an early review on the
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.600]   Apple Watch and over the last couple weeks he decided to spend some time without it but because
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.280]   he's been Beherin and because he's an analyst he didn't just take it off and then share his feelings
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.560]   about it he actually recorded data to show what his behavior was like when he was wearing it and
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:10.120]   what his behavior was like when he stopped wearing it um and one of the hard things about the Apple
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.440]   Watch is that with a lot of Apple products it's about how immersive the experience is is how
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:20.760]   much time you spend watching Apple TV or playing games or or reading stuff on your iPad or you know
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:25.720]   communicating on your iPhone it's how much you're involved in it's constant but with the Apple Watch
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.360]   it's sort of like how much time can we save you and that's a harder metric to measure because
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.720]   it's sort of a disengagement metric but Ben uh to his credit documented it and he was showing
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:41.320]   how many times for example he reached for his iPhone when he had his Apple Watch versus not
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:46.840]   having his Apple Watch uh Trinity I don't know about you I went a weekend just to try without
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:51.160]   without an Apple Watch to see what it would feel like and I I never realized before I just would
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.960]   see empty wrist and that was a clue that how often I was just used to glancing at my Apple Watch
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:02.600]   before without even realizing it absolutely I feel exactly the same way um I have been taking
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.480]   this off I've been moving recently and even though Apple shows you moving with Apple Watches and
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:11.720]   you know using it as a way to get your activity points in I've been taking it off because we've
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.360]   been going through tight doorways and I don't want to bang it everywhere and every time I take it off
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:22.680]   for a short period of time it's like where'd you go and I I do I've become much more aware of where
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.520]   my phone is at all times whereas with the watch I feel much more comfortable leaving my phone like
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.440]   there are times when I don't know where my phone in is in the house and actually I had a stress stream
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:38.440]   of all things I had a stress stream last night where I was in a movie theater and I had walked out
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:45.000]   with my my iPhone and I was using my Apple Watch to try and figure out where in the movie theater
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.520]   my iPhone was because it would go in between showing the connected at the top and the disconnect
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.480]   like this is how weird this product is that it has infiltrated my stress streams about not knowing
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:02.760]   where my iPhone is um but yeah I I really I really like the watch I think that it's not you know
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:09.720]   I'm not talking about it non-stop as much as I used to but I still think it's a very vital part of
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:16.280]   my my day-to-day beings and it's it's gone into a very much more subtle pattern than it used to be
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:22.040]   Ben called it a modern-day convenience Andy almost like a dishwasher where yeah you can wash
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.960]   your own dishes but once you get used to having a dishwasher it's just so convenient you really
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.440]   don't want to go back yeah I think he's I can't speak for him I I wonder if what he's saying is
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:40.200]   true of smart watches in general because I'm still on week five week six is now I'm editing what was
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.680]   originally 9,000 birds on Apple Watch that's being split up into different pieces and
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.960]   only when I was preparing to give a talk on a different subject that I actually sat down and
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:56.440]   thought okay how many different apps on this watch are you actually using regularly and I could not
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:00.200]   mention this I cannot think of a single one of them that is not a built-in watch app
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.000]   all the stuff that I like about it are the stuff that I like about smart watches in general being
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.320]   able to get notifications on your wrist having a fitness tracker built in having something sort
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:15.960]   of cooler than just regular analog watch on your wrist and I'm still kind of more hurting for the
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:22.200]   lack of Android wear than for Apple Watch but I think that's logical and reasonable because the
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:27.080]   watch that I was wearing for eight or nine months like that had six or seven or eight months worth
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.720]   of tweaks and improvements and upgrades on it I really think that's as we've been saying for the
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:36.600]   past month it's going to be a game changer when watch OS 2 comes out in the fall that's when we're
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.200]   really gonna so that's when I think the the watch really launches and that's when I'm going to have
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:46.040]   to go back and reevaluate because I did as a matter of fact take off my watch for I didn't actually
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.440]   take it off though the battery ran down and then I had the charger someplace that's not on my
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.920]   nightstand and so I sort of forgot about it and wound up wearing my old analog watch for two or three
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:01.000]   days and to be honest I really didn't miss it it was it's a nice convenience but it's not the sort
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.160]   of thing where I feel oh my god I go I got to drive back to the house because I'm not wearing my
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:09.480]   Apple watch but different you didn't get the addictive version Andy the one with a little
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.000]   subcutaneous implant that that keeps you all see that that's that's that's why that's why I put
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.200]   the gaffer tape on the bottom of the sensor there you know just just you know again trust but verify
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:22.520]   Ashley you and I wear a bunch of the sessions at WWDC and what Andy's talking about the watch
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.360]   oh the watch OS 2.0 stuff looks super interesting yeah absolutely I'm very intrigued to see
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:34.040]   what apps are going to come as a result of being able to run natively on the watch now
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:38.920]   it's funny I felt myself installing apps just because they had Apple watch support
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:44.200]   you know even apps I've previously deleted and now I've noticed that I've I tend to keep using
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:50.200]   just the activity tracker heart rate monitoring and you know pausing and playing music or podcasts
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:56.280]   I feel like my my use of the different kinds of apps is almost like regressed a little bit
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:03.960]   um and so I'm intrigued to see if if watch OS 2 is going to sort of like pull me back in or get
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.160]   me interested in using different types of apps or not primarily I just use it for the notifications
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:13.800]   I certainly miss it when I'm exercising there was one time I left it at work for the weekend
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.600]   and I really wished I had it with me when I went out and played football some of my friends
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:23.960]   uh but that's about it you know for for social engagements or the trip I took over the weekend I
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:29.320]   didn't bring my Apple watch with me so uh but I do notice that I miss having a watch like I have
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:34.040]   a watch 10 now there has to be something on my wrist if it's not the Apple watch it's got to be an
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:39.160]   analog watch just to hear me just hear me just hear me just hear me just hear me just hear me just
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:45.640]   just hearing you say that puts me in Serenity's stress dream all right so we are in the fine
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:50.040]   tradition of Mac break weekly we are going to do our picks of the week and we're going to start
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:55.400]   with the inimitable Andy and not go what do you have for us this weekend Andy uh mine is I picked
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.040]   this without knowing what we were going to be talking about it just a complete accident mine is
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:07.960]   the knee band uh which is you the the TLDR on this one is that it is a cheap ass fitness band uh it
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:12.680]   is made in China and you can buy it you can't there's I don't think that there's a distributor for it in
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:17.720]   the United States but if you go to Amazon you can pay all of 12 or 13 stinking dollars for it
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:23.560]   and in two to three weeks one will be shipped to you from Asia uh and the weird thing is about it
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:28.360]   that I'm sort of been on this jag with the past year year and a half of looking for really
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:33.640]   stupid cheap versions of different pieces of technology to see how well or how poorly they
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:41.400]   perform and this performs really really well uh it's only about as uh feature rich as an entry
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:46.760]   level fitness band so it has a motion so it can count your steps it will count your movement when
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:53.560]   you're uh and figure out how you're sleeping it also has a uh you know uh has a uh a uh a
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:58.200]   feedback device on it so it will buzz when your phone rings uh you can twist it and lights will
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:03.640]   show up to show you how much how close you are to your step goal and it has a actually very very
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:11.240]   nice uh nicely done uh iOS app uh that will let you get access to all that information uh and so
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:18.200]   the big now is it great it's not superb I mean it's not cheaply made I mean there is nothing
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.560]   about this band that seems cheap it's made out of the same grade of polymer it's a greater polymer
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:28.440]   that was made specifically for use in fitness tracker so it's not cheap it doesn't uh break
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:35.880]   or anything like that on you uh the battery uh lasts pretty much forever uh i've i charged it up
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:40.680]   when i bought it two months ago and i just checked this morning and the battery is still at about
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:46.120]   50 percent uh i did have it off for about a week or two during that because i was testing other
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:51.160]   fitness bands uh but the the great thing about it though is that uh it's like i was talking about
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:57.240]   earlier uh the idea of wearing a fitness monitor to at least keep you appraised of here's how much
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:01.000]   you're moving every single day or more to the point here's how much you're not moving every single
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.520]   day here's how much sleep you're getting every night or more to the point here's a much sleep
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:09.400]   you're not getting every night there are a couple of different barriers to people getting the benefits
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:15.800]   of wearing a fitness tracker one of them is that they can't see spending 60 or 70 dollars for this
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.440]   when they don't know uh if it's going to be usable and secondly they don't necessarily want to take
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:24.600]   this off their wrist every single night and pop it into a charger or even do that once a week
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:29.640]   with this one you can actually just keep it on all the time it has the ip uh rating so that you
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:35.960]   can actually shower with it you can swim with it uh it'll work just fine uh and so if it's a cheap
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:41.800]   way to enter into this sort of awareness and then it leads to you six or seven months later wanting
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:46.600]   to buy an apple watch or wanting to buy a better fitness band i think that's all to the good people
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:51.640]   a lot of people can risk 12 bucks so they they can they can't even risk 70 or 80 bucks the only
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:56.600]   there are only two other qualms that i'll give about it uh in that um the app is very very good
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:03.240]   it's integration to health works so you can go into the health dashboard and allow this app to feed
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.960]   information into uh into the health app uh i'm i've been reading for the past two or three weeks
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.680]   people who test these things a lot regrosly than i know how to do and they're reporting that it's
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:19.800]   a lot of the data that comes in is a little bit uh off or not not necessarily great uh and so for
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:24.200]   now my recommendation before i check this out myself is it's okay if you don't plug this if you
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:28.280]   don't connect hook this up to the health app you just use the built-in apps which are very very nice
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:34.200]   and very very easy to use the second thing is that uh the when you launch the app you have to you
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:39.160]   pair it with your phone you have to run this free app that you get off of the iTunes store and the
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.920]   first thing it will do to by default it will ask you to use a phone number as your id so it can sync
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:51.800]   data to the the wonderful world of me uh servers in the world you don't have to do that i couldn't
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:55.640]   find a way around it when i first downloaded this app two months ago what i did because
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:01.480]   my my instinctive reaction is why the hell do you think you need my phone number just to be able to
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:06.600]   sync data between the phone and the device if you go to the me.com site you can actually
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:10.520]   create an account on the site and it doesn't require a phone number you can just use whatever
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.240]   made up name whatever uh burner email address you want to use and then plug that in and it'll work
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:18.760]   just fine but like i said very nice recommendation it's definitely you definitely have to accept
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.480]   this is a thirteen dollar thing and not a two hundred dollar thing but again if it gets you
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.960]   to get access that information to tell you that wow i'm only sleeping four hours a night or
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.360]   wow i had two whole days in a row where i walked fewer than two thousand steps
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.520]   that's a really pretty big win for not a whole lot of money and if you want to dip your toe into the
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:42.040]   whole um quantified life thing but you don't want to dive full into the deep end of the watch pool
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:48.440]   you can exactly check this out uh Ashley do you have something for us i do i have this article from
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:54.280]   uh i guess essence got the uh exclusive essence magazine but over the weekend eva duvarnay the
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:56:01.320]   director of salma announced that she would not be uh directing the black panther movie uh which i
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.360]   thought i just found really interesting uh because you know lately we've been talking about or
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:12.360]   in the public discourses and we talked about this a little bit earlier but this idea of of of having
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:18.680]   superheroes that um you know represent the full spectrum of people and uh aren't you know
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:24.440]   stereotypically of of one character type and so you know the marvel ostensibly wants to produce
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:30.520]   this movie called black panther uh which would have a black male lead and eva duvarnay was up for
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:36.920]   uh the directorship and i just found it really interesting that you know a position that she
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.920]   could have had as a as the director of a big budget film possibly would have done great things for
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.800]   her career or maybe not but she decided not to take the position because of creative differences
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:53.240]   and i just thought that was really incredible because um it could have been very easy for her
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:59.480]   as a black woman to take on the role of directing um one of the first major black superhero films
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:05.640]   and for her to decide that it wasn't for her uh be based on again creative differences uh i just
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:11.320]   thought was really incredible and and um it continues to she just continues to impress me and sort of
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:15.880]   like the decision she makes as a director and sort of what films she enrolls she takes on and i'm
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:21.160]   interested to see how this project will um go moving forward they have Chadwick Bozeman who's
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:27.640]   supposed to play the title character and he also played um jacie robinson and james brown recently
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:31.880]   so we'll see how that goes but it'll either way it'll be moving forward without eva duvarnay
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:36.920]   it's interesting because marvel seems to be running these movies not like a typical movie
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:41.400]   studio where you have just a director who's in charge of the movie but more like a tv show
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.560]   where you have a showrunner who then gets directors and the directors are way less important than the
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:51.800]   overall story being told by the show and directors like her uh and you hear that a little bit now
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.440]   with joss weeden uh and you've you've heard that with um i'm blanking on his name but the original
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:02.440]   antman director uh who wanted who basically want to do more of a traditional movie relationship
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:04.760]   and it's interesting i think it's absolutely interesting what you said but i think it's also
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:09.080]   interesting for the sort of different voices we get in the marvel universe and whether that will be
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:14.680]   suppressed compared to the overall marvel vision yeah that's a good point about marvel's vision and
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:18.760]   sort of they're like directing by committee almost at least that's how joss we'd made it sound with
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:25.000]   some of the directions he didn't like take in and adventures to age of ultron um and he was very
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.920]   vocal about sort of the decisions that they made and and you know that one scene in particular
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:32.360]   rithor takes off a shirt and gets in the pool and it just kind of doesn't make sense spoiler alert
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:38.040]   for anybody who didn't see that uh you know it's it's funny i don't i've never understood
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:42.360]   taking off his shirt never makes sense actually i mean come on that's just you just has to do it
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:50.200]   i just uh i've never understood is that you hire people who are great and and good at what they do
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:53.480]   and then you you're supposed to put them in these positions of power where they can make an impact
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:59:00.520]   and do what you hired them to do uh but then people come in and and make these choices that
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:03.800]   you know you don't have the same like film background knowledge i don't know it doesn't really make
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.000]   much sense to me i don't know why you would hire someone great put them in that position but then
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.200]   handicap them and i'm sure that's what happened to eva or that's what i would guess happened and in
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:15.640]   these conversations and she sort of realized she wouldn't have as much creative control as she
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:20.760]   wanted and and was more than willing to back off of uh what will be a i'm sure a big budget film
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:26.600]   super um i think that's going to be a bigger i don't know if it's a bigger problem but it's
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:30.520]   going to be a more interesting issue to watch as the marvel universe in general and as we all
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:34.840]   grapple with bigger diversity not only in technology companies but in media portrayals and and and
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:41.560]   other areas so dody what do you have for us um i also have a little bit of an unconventional pick
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:49.480]   which is to say that uh for people who missed st vince since uh mixtape on beats one last week
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:55.560]   she is doing it's a it's going to be a recurring weekly thing and i believe her second episode is
[01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:03.080]   coming up tonight later today at uh 10 p.m. eastern seven p.m. pacific the first episode that she did
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:10.280]   involved a adorable 11 year old named piper who likes to dance by herself basically the concept is
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:15.400]   st vince st vincent makes a mixtape for somebody who writes her a letter and then they have a
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:20.520]   conversation about the kind of music that that person likes and she builds them a a tracklist
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:28.920]   and then she plays it uh live on on beats one it was hands down the the first thing that made me
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:36.280]   really go wow okay i yeah i really get why this why this has the potential to just be so cool
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:44.840]   and so i'm really excited to hear what she has um what she has next uh what any clerk has next
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:51.320]   because um i i i think that it's a really fun idea making a mixtape from someone who writes you a
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:57.880]   letter uh she has very good taste and uh i'm curious who who's the the next lucky participant
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:05.960]   writing my letter right now right now uh my pick of the week actually real time follow up uh
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:09.240]   Virgilio Corrado on twitter says was Edgar Wright was the name that i was banking on
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.560]   Edgar Wright who was the original director of Antman uh so my pick of the week comes courtesy
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:20.680]   of Ferrico Vitticci from MacStories.net who had a great sort of app tip uh right now there's no
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:24.600]   built-in lyrics functionality in apple music maybe it'll come eventually maybe it won't
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:31.080]   but he had an app called music's and pryron's great music's match with an x in it and what this app
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:36.360]   does is it just takes the music that's playing in the media controller for um ios and gives you the
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:41.080]   lyrics to it and they have a huge licensed lyrics database but he discovered by accident that it is
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:45.400]   already working for apple music because apple music is playing through the same pipes as other
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:51.880]   media sources on ios so you install this and i'm using it as a widget the same way he suggested
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:55.400]   and if you're listening to apple music and you want to sing along you want to torment those people
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.640]   around you uh you just pull down notification center you see the widget within a couple seconds
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:04.520]   the widget is showing you uh the lyrics for the line of music that's playing at that moment and
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:10.040]   you can just follow along and either belt it out or in the case of bands like eros myth figure out
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:15.240]   what they're saying to begin with and it's just it's it's hugely enjoyable if you are a fan of the
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:20.440]   lyrics uh sometimes the poetry of the music you're listening to so it's called music's match it's
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:26.680]   free there's a larger service um that they provide but just the simple widget is is a really cool
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:30.840]   thing because you can pull it down from anywhere in ios it's it's again that that incredible
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:35.800]   difference between ios 8 and ios 7 in that you don't have to go hunting around for an app to show
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:40.760]   this anywhere that you are in ios you can just pull down notification center and it's there and this
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:47.560]   is just another example of how awesome that is so those are the picks of the week and this uh is
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:54.040]   mac break weekly i want to thank everyone for joining us uh serenity anything cool that you're
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:01.560]   working on anything you want to plug more iTunes match craziness uh and apple music stuff on imora.com

[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:13.640]   which i'm really psyched about um and uh yeah i think those are those are the two big things
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:20.440]   what about you actually what's coming up um so my twitter account is ashley and h which is up there
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.480]   uh right now actually i'm working on producing a video show with a friend uh she recently quit

[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.840]   sometimes for humorous effect that you try to do it english accent or something like that that's
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.720]   another accent that okay i'm never gonna do that again because now i know somebody who actually
