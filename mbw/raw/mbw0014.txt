[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twit.

[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.920]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 14 for November 7, 2006.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.440]   Hey, Macarena.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   Mac Break Weekly, time to gather.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.320]   Once again, to talk about the Mac and Tunk,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.680]   share with us Mac-a-Tosh Mavens from around the world,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.920]   starting with the East Coast, Brett Larson.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.560]   From channel 2, hey, Brett.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.200]   Woo-hoo.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.280]   Hey, how's it going, guys?
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.920]   It's going really well.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.040]   And all looks well on the way.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.400]   East Coast.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.560]   That's right, because it's late at night there.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.280]   Well, not late, but the polls just closed, I guess,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.680]   about 20 minutes again.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.280]   I think they--
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.440]   Eight o'clock?
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.600]   Is that when they close?
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.880]   I think they closed at eight, but they
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.560]   might have stayed open an hour later
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.200]   because of the electronic voting problems.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.160]   Were there problems already with the electronic voting?
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.960]   There weren't in New York, but there were all the rest of the state.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.640]   Usually in places where Republicans
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.560]   had an opportunity to win because they're rigging the election.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.400]   Now I'm sorry.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.200]   Did I say that?
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   I had to--
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.840]   I'm going to get the mail now.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.520]   Scott Borne is a Republican.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.320]   And if he's not, he ought to be.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   The Thurston Hell, the third of the show,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.880]   all the way from beautiful--
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.520]   somebody's laughing in the background--
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760]   all the way from beautiful Seattle?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.440]   Listen, yes, I'm in Seattle, and my political affiliation
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.600]   is not Republican.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.800]   I won't say what it is, but it's not Republican.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.960]   And I did vote a straight Macintosh ticket today.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.040]   OK.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.680]   True Blue, Alex Lindsay, who is in San Francisco
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:23.520]   and the head and honcho of the P
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.160]   Microisma.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.880]   And if you're laughing at this, you should be embarrassed.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.760]   D&D jokes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.440]   We specialize in them here on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.120]   So top 10-- top story of the week comes to us from Mr. Scott
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.520]   Borne, according to Apple Insider, OS 10,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.360]   significant share gains in October.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.920]   Largest share gains-- one of the largest share gains to date.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.760]   How do they measure that, Scott?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.040]   They just take a look at operating system sales,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440]   and who's doing well and who's not.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.600]   And their clear decision is that the Intel switch
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.040]   was good for Apple, which is not a real hard thing to figure out.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.280]   And I'm glad to say that I bought back into my Apple stock
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.400]   after dumping it, thinking that the options scandal
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.200]   was going to hurt him.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.040]   So I hope this news pushes us up on the market.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   That's great.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.520]   SEC's going to be calling me in the morning.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320]   My name is Leila Port, if you have any questions.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.560]   The only other operating system to increase its share was XP.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.120]   Everybody else was down, including 2098, ME, NT, and Linux.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   You kind of expect that of the first few of them.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.040]   I was really surprised to see that ME isn't just kicking butt.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.200]   But now we--
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.480]   I was not surprised to know that anybody actually uses that.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.520]   When you talk about this OS 10 Intel, though, it's not
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.720]   exactly a massive market share.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.760]   It's a 1.12% share of the market.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.840]   Well, growth, it's the move up that they're talking about.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   0.84% growth.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.440]   OS 10 for Power PC is 3.88% market share.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.360]   So still, more than three times the number of the Intel.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.040]   But given that you're looking at the legacy of a lot of people
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.640]   hanging onto their computers, and so you're talking about a quarter
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.960]   of the Mac users moving over to Intel.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.840]   In just six months.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.440]   That's a single year.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.560]   Yeah, that's pretty fast.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.120]   No, nine months.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.680]   That's pretty quick.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.440]   I'm all Intel.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   Are you guys all Intel?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.720]   Anybody still using a Power PC?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.080]   I have a lot of people.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.360]   We've got eight or nine computers here.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   So they're not all Intel yet.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240]   But in fact, my production computer
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.080]   still G5, a quad G5, because of Photoshop.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.040]   Brett Larson, you said you're still Power PC?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.680]   No, no.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.000]   I have a MacBook Pro and a MacBook.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.440]   Scott, did you--
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.320]   On a Mac Mini, that's Intel.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.800]   Yeah, frankly, I'm all Intel, too.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.720]   I got rid of all this stuff.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.320]   Scott, did you get--
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.240]   You made it off.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.920]   RPC.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.320]   Did you get your MacBook Pro yet, Scott?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.640]   No, but it was ordered 12 days ago.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.800]   And they said shipping in seven to 10 days.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720]   And since I got the 17-inch model,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.840]   it takes a little bit longer.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.560]   But I'm kind of driving by the post office box every day,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.640]   hoping it'll show up.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.520]   You had it sent to a post office box?
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.280]   I'm just kidding.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.600]   No, I didn't.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.360]   No, I don't have a Mac Pro yet, but I do have a shuffle.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   I got the new little--
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   I went out-- I had to go out and run out
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.200]   and get a new shuffle.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.400]   Is that count?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.920]   Is that an Intel-based shuffle?
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.240]   Intel-shuffle.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.360]   Yeah, no, yeah, exactly.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.280]   No, it's not.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.040]   But it's really cool.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.160]   That came out the size of it.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.760]   It came out Friday.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.960]   And you were one of the first.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   You like it?
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.960]   Well, I have the same complaint that I had
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.720]   about my other shuffle, which was-- well, here's--
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.480]   it's kind of mixed.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.200]   Number one is that it's really cool because it is microscopic.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.240]   When Steve said it was impossibly small,
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.840]   it really is.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.640]   My biggest fear is that I'm going to lose it.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.240]   You know, you just said it's so small.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.600]   And I can keep on forgetting that I have it in my pocket,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.160]   kind of thing.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.320]   And the thing that I don't like about it
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.280]   is it doesn't have a USB built into it anymore.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.880]   So the old shuffle you could kind of use as a memory stick.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.320]   You know, so I just moved files around.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.640]   I keep them-- and I'd move them around.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.040]   And now I have to have this little cable that I hook up
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200]   because it doesn't have that kind of hook up which kind of
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.680]   bothered me.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.600]   And then there's the typical--
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.640]   because you don't have an interface for it,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.320]   you have to kind of skip through songs kind of blindly.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.640]   So you really have to create the playlist.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.760]   I don't see any reason for these ever to get bigger than a gig
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.400]   because you have to kind of create the playlist that you
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.680]   know you want to listen to because getting to other songs
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.760]   is kind of a pain in the neck.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.680]   It's really just for putting a couple of CDs on and listening
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.480]   to them either shuffled or in order, right?
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.280]   Well, what I do is it's literally sitting in my locker.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.640]   I just use it for working out.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.680]   And so it's great for me to not have something that I feel
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.400]   like is going to fall off or fall somewhere.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.000]   I just clip it onto my clothes, whatever I'm doing well,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.280]   I'm benching or doing whatever I'm doing.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.920]   And it's just great to be out of the way.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.240]   I just started using it over the weekend and it was very freeing.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.400]   I think they're just made for smart playlists.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.880]   That's the way that we've used the shuffle in the past
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.160]   is I'm a huge fan of smart playlists
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.040]   and where you might want to do something--
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.840]   I mean, I like the kind of complex ones that
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   are along the lines of show me everything with greater
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.960]   than three stars that I haven't listened to in the last two
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.120]   weeks or something like that.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.080]   Well, I use it for pop-up.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.200]   And that can be a great way to say--
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.080]   It's a great way to just--
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.800]   Yeah, I just say fill it to this amount of available room.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   It's as Steve has always positioned it,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.240]   kind of a random thing.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.720]   It doesn't have a screen.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.080]   I mean, how can you complain about that?
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.600]   That's what it is.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.120]   Right.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.640]   No, no, no.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.360]   Well, I mean, as I said, I mean, that's the thing that I find
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.040]   that the only reason I like to go back to my little nano
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   or my-- you know, all the other pop-up, all the other iPods
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.360]   that I have left floating around is because I like the screen.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.280]   I'm not complaining about it.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.160]   I'm saying that's just the thing that I always notice myself
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.400]   going, oh, I want to get to something.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.560]   If I don't really have the playlist exactly what I want
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.160]   on that nano at that moment, it's going to be--
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.200]   like, I never want to mix podcasts and music
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.720]   because then I end up with these podcasts
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.600]   like intermixed into my music.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.240]   But it's really, as I said, as a workout for working out
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.400]   or doing short stuff or things that I'm
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.000]   going to update all the time, it really
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.520]   works.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.600]   So it's fun.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.920]   I like the Smart Playlist, by the way, but I really wish--
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.680]   and I think a lot of us here, since we've done--
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.400]   some of us have done radio, I really
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.040]   wish they would let us do programming style smart lists,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.840]   where you're able to build mini lists
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.600]   and then build a list that accesses the lists.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.120]   Basically, so you could have a hot rotation, medium rotation,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.320]   recurrence, where you could have it actually accessing folders.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.600]   No, you can have-- that's one of the best things that
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.400]   happened a few releases ago is building playlists
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.760]   based on other playlists.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.280]   So for example, I have a playlist called,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.760]   we're way down a rat hole here.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.960]   No, no, this is the kind of rat hole I like to be down.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.280]   Well, I have one playlist that I'm pretty
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.960]   anal about, which is what I call it the musical only playlist.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   And so I say I have a very complex if statement for that,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.120]   where it says it's not a podcast and it's not a stream
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.960]   and it's not a this and it's not a that and so on and so forth.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.520]   And so that creates a kind of pure non-spoken word,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.560]   non-anything, it's not music.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.760]   And then that's what I use to base all of my other playlist
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.400]   on.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.320]   And I don't think I don't want to go to iTunes
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   because I don't want to screw up the podcast.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.080]   But I believe in iTunes, it's one of the--
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.560]   I think it's something-- is a member of playlist,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.520]   less than such.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.000]   So just base your playlist on that.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.800]   It's extremely powerful.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.400]   And you can have additional conditions on that.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.520]   So you could say, is a member of playlist X
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.360]   and I haven't listened to it?
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:25.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.760]   You could-- oh, absolutely.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.400]   Yeah, that's where this gets really powerful.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.880]   And it's the kind of functionality
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   that I cannot wait to see going to stuff like mail.app.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   Or the iPhone.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.800]   Oh, geez.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.600]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.120]   Relatives.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.560]   Thank you very much.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.760]   Relatives I have not called in three weeks.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.200]   And back with the weekly drinking game,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.800]   you may now take two drinks because we've mentioned the iPhone.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.280]   Yes.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.960]   You know, that is, in fact, the only command
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.320]   in the drinking game.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.600]   But Merlin, what I want to be able to do is say,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.800]   build a-- and tell me, this may be possible,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.520]   and I just don't know how to do it, is--
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.040]   so let's say I build six different playlists.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.400]   So literally, I build six individual playlists.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.480]   And then what I want to do is have another playlist that
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.200]   says, OK, play from song from playlist one, randomly
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.080]   select from playlist one, and then the next song
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.960]   wants you to randomly select from playlist two, and then three,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.360]   and then go back and then play another song from playlist one,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.520]   then play-- so I'm basically building a playlist that
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.760]   randomly grabs a song in sequential order
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.120]   from the order that I get.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.640]   I don't know if you could do that in terms
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.600]   of having it go ABCDE, ABCDE.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.800]   But you could say, is-- so just do five playlists for ABCDE,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.200]   and then say, choose from random random from these five
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.720]   playlists.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   Is that kind of what you're thinking of?
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.760]   No, this is the--
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.400]   --you got your face pressed, your squat,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   your drinking water.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:47.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   Here's what you want.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.200]   Like, what I'm trying to do is--
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.800]   It's not like a bad day in the radio class.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.840]   But what I really want to be able to do
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.360]   is just--
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.880]   I mean, with this radio station 101.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.040]   But there's songs that I really want to listen to a lot
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.540]   right now.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.240]   But then there's other songs that I don't want to listen to
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.760]   very often.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.960]   But I want to have a little bit of those sprinkled in.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.520]   It is radio.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.880]   I mean, that's what I used to do.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.440]   It used to program it out.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.520]   So I want that radio station.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   And your A rotation.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.040]   Exactly.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.400]   I want to be able to change all those rotations.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.240]   And then I want to hear a group of songs.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.960]   I only want to hear them once a day.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.920]   But there's other songs that I want to hear all the time.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.800]   This is the craziest Matt, Si, and this playlist request
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.640]   I've ever heard.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.920]   There's one thing that--
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.760]   It's every radio station does exactly that.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.960]   So it's not Matt's scientists.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.520]   It's just that.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   One that you can do a lot of this--
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.220]   I just want to know repeat workday.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.340]   Well, it's the Tuesday.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.020]   So tune in for a little bit of "Skinard."
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.380]   Me and Molly--
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.540]   And now it's time to get the let out.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.580]   It's Molly Hatchet on a thirsty Thursday.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.100]   You know what's funny is that everybody here, except Merlin,
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.620]   has been a DJ.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.980]   And Merlin does right.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.500]   That's funny.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.180]   And Merlin's the one who's trying to explain how to do it.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.020]   So when we went to a quick plot--
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.660]   I don't know if this conversation is so great.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.220]   I don't have this post in front of me right now.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.940]   But one of the best posts on this that I ever read
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.740]   was this fellow writing about how he
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.400]   created his little custom radio station on his computer.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.240]   And he did this thing.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.800]   Now, you have to be like me.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.360]   You've got to be someone who rates songs.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.760]   And they can't all be five.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.040]   But what he does-- the mix that he suggests
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:13.080]   is going in and saying, like, so give me this many songs
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.320]   from things that I have rated three stars and haven't
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.520]   listened to in this long.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.320]   This many from-- that I rated four stars
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.240]   and have it listened to in this long, and so on.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.400]   And you can kind of--
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.240]   it gets you in the habit of rating better
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   because it really does then lead to this better radio station
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.740]   mix.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.940]   Is that kind of what you're thinking of?
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.760]   It's kind of like it.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.800]   I just don't think it's that--
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.840]   I don't think it'd be that hard for Apple to do that.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   And I will say that.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.040]   I think they did it, though.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.640]   No, I don't think this is still not--
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.280]   this is still some kind of random.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.240]   It's an implicit way to kind of go towards that.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   It sounds like what you want.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.080]   I want to hear three songs by Celine Dion.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.040]   And then I want to hear four songs that are three minutes.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.540]   No, no, no.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.040]   I want to hear three songs that have a color in it.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.340]   Yeah, I know.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.520]   I'm not sure what you want.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.640]   I really want to be able to say--
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.140]   I don't--
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.000]   I want to be able to just throw things into my different rotations.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.620]   I want to be able to throw a bunch of songs in there
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.660]   and have them and know that my police songs only show up
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.060]   once a day.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.060]   I mean, I really like the police,
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.100]   but I don't need to hear them all the every day anymore.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.900]   And so they're in my gold rotation in there.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.660]   And then I have--
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.700]   and it's just a simple paradigm of being--
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.380]   I don't want to write all these rules.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.780]   All I want to do is grab the folder
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.540]   and drag them into a playlist one at a time and say,
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.460]   this is the order--
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.700]   I have a pile of playlists that have the songs that I like
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.300]   in the different areas that I like.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.380]   I just want to drag them in and say,
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.580]   I want this one and this one and this one.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.740]   I'm going to make an executive decision here.
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.820]   Alex, forget it.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.820]   Cheese in this place.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.820]   And there's an awful lot of cheese.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.820]   It'd be easy.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   Forget it.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.820]   No, you didn't.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.140]   That's me if I'm still using anything PowerPC.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.060]   I got left off of that one.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.460]   Oh, Merlin, are you using anything PowerPC?
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.620]   It's actually funny you should ask that, Leo.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.140]   You know how you get a new computer
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.540]   and you're all pumped up about it.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   And then you start going, oh, man,
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.140]   this isn't really that much faster.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.380]   What's the big deal?
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.860]   Well, I'm here to tell you.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.940]   I went back and I used Instant Handbrake
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.820]   to remove some video from a fully DVD
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.460]   that I own of some kitty photos.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.540]   But I ran Instant Handbrake on my old 17-inch.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.020]   And oh, my god, it took like four times as long as it does.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.620]   Well, that's a good example of what
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.780]   is going to take a lot longer, absolutely.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.420]   But I'm here to tell you.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.180]   When I first switched, I did not notice that much of a difference.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.340]   Well, you're not kind of with Safari and Word,
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.580]   but you're going to notice a big difference with ripping
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.500]   and transcoding, which is what you're doing.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.940]   Yeah, unbelievable.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.420]   I mean, apart from that, our family is moving.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.460]   Actually, you know what, though?
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.740]   My wife still has a 12-inch.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.860]   That is--
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.340]   You know, many women would be just perfectly content with that.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.140]   Yeah, well, my wife has 12-inch.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.780]   I swelled her.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.180]   I really, really, really swelled her when I got a 12-inch.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.460]   Let's just stop right here.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.740]   OK, please stand up.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.420]   My 15-inch, actually, she's had a 12-inch for a long time,
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.260]   but I'm giving her the 15 now.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.620]   Because I'm just trying to find an excuse to buy a MacBook
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.180]   Pro, to be honest with you.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.700]   Isn't you guys see the post about the supposed--
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.740]   did you see the Gizmodo post about the supposed
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.340]   not 39% improvement in speed?
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.380]   Yes.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.700]   I think that that's, again, it depends what you do, right?
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.980]   If it's CPU bound and it's transcoding,
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.020]   you're going to see a big improvement over a power PC,
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.020]   anyway.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.460]   But it's like 10% over a core duo.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.460]   And I think it's also important about-- yeah, it's not just--
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.500]   it's CPU intensive that also is not too ram intensive
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.620]   or too drive intensive.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.900]   Because the I/O is the same time.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.100]   Yeah, the I/O is slower.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.500]   So you need to have it be something that really--
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.940]   like, for instance, if we're doing 3D,
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.020]   if we do these really high-end calculations,
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.260]   it's really fast.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.540]   But anything that requires a lot of movement of the data
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.980]   is going to slow everything back down again.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.660]   Brett, you wanted to say something?
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.140]   Oh, no, I'm just not agreeing.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.220]   You're nodding, OK.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.220]   I heard the nodding.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.180]   I'm nodding on radio work, so it really well.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.740]   I heard the nodding.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.300]   I mean, Brett Larson actually has a jingle.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.900]   I wish I still had that.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.980]   I'm going to have loaded up right now, of course.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.260]   No, the thing I noticed-- of course,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.820]   I was coming from-- I hate to admit--
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:06.820]   I replaced my dual processor 1.25 gigahertz G4.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.780]   Oh, well, that's slow.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.820]   Book pro dual core, which is I think it's a gig and a half.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.140]   OK, you think I would know.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.100]   [DING]
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.620]   Sorry, I just had to throw that in.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.940]   2 gigahertz, 10.16.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.860]   Speaking of--
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.580]   Speaking of welcome to the real world,
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.340]   Macarena, an actual virus for the Macintosh.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.340]   Or kind of.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.300]   Announced by--
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.300]   I mean, it's by Symantec.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.460]   It calls it a low-level virus.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.780]   They're calling it OSX Macarena.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.380]   Information Week is saying it's a warning of things to come.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.460]   People just really want there to be a nasty virus for the Mac.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.700]   And you know who wants there to be a virus more than anybody?
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.700]   Symantec.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.540]   Symantec.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.540]   That's right.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.540]   In fact, I drove through the cubicle farms
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.980]   down in Hillsborough, Oregon the other day.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.180]   And I was looking at Symantec's cubicle farms thinking,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.020]   I wonder if that's the one where the virus is going to go.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.100]   So now, let's not say that.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.100]   I don't think the anti-virus--
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.140]   You're a kidder.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.180]   I don't think the anti-virus companies build viruses.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.780]   They don't have to.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.060]   There's plenty of guys willing to do that.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.580]   I kid the virus company.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.020]   According to Sophos, you're more likely--
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.380]   this is a quote from a Sophos researcher.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.300]   You're more likely to be struck by lightning
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.380]   than troubled by Macarena.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.380]   Wow.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.220]   Well, there you go.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.300]   Thanks, Symantec.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.380]   They even Symantec gave it its lowest warning.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.820]   It said it's a proof of concept virus.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.820]   I'm trying to find more details on how it actually works here.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.460]   Let me see.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.140]   In fact, other files, when they are executed in the current
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.620]   directory, regardless of file name or extension,
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.580]   it doesn't sound like it really does much at all.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.060]   What is it allegedly?
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.060]   It doesn't really do much.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.580]   I think it's kind of a non-issue.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.860]   They're just excited that they actually found one.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.700]   They're so happy.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.060]   It just really makes me mad now.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.380]   Can we talk?
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.300]   It's all these windows people just dying for there
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.500]   to be a Mac virus.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.460]   And I'm sorry, guys.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.580]   If you're in pain, it's not our fault.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.740]   If we get one, we'll still be like 3.29
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.020]   kabillion behind them.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.100]   I'm going to wait a look at this.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.260]   Personally, maybe I'm just superstitious,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.380]   or maybe it's the fact that I remember the days back
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.780]   in college when every time you popped your disk into the drive,
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.940]   you ended up getting that one virus everybody got
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.140]   in the late '80s.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.620]   Oh, I mean, the first viruses were Mac OS, whatever it was,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.820]   7 viruses.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.860]   Man, back in '60s, yeah.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.820]   But I mean, I guess I--
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.220]   I don't want other viruses.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.980]   I can't shake it.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.740]   So I've never been somebody who personally--
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.740]   I think it's a little bit--
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.340]   No, Sean and Freud for you, Mr. Merlin, man.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.100]   I don't.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.180]   Because there's a part of me that really still believes
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.500]   we're just not a rich enough target.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.460]   Now, having said that, I think all the time, and all scare,
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.820]   I think the way you really learn how this stuff works
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.420]   isn't what the response is.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.900]   And so that's why, to me, that's why I really
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.620]   think the Firefox people have it on the stick.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.780]   Because anything happens, and they are flipping that around
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.140]   as quick as possible.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.620]   If you want to be sarcastic, let's
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.780]   be sarcastic about the fact that Microsoft seems
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.380]   to be patching their DRM faster than they're
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.100]   patching their security vulnerabilities.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.380]   But I think it's a little bit--
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.180]   Personally, I'm never going to be a person who gets out here
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.380]   and makes one of people nenenak as you get viruses.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.180]   Let's not look for the attention.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.340]   Viruses-- yeah, but let's look at what's really important here.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.860]   It's not-- I mean, there's going to be viruses for the Mac.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.860]   And as it gets popular, you want to imagine
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.300]   this is going to happen.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.500]   The real proof in the pudding is going
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.900]   to be how fast they can flip around changes that are going
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.420]   to keep it from mounting, right?
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   And isn't that--
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.780]   No, and I agree, and I shouldn't say that.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.500]   It's really reflected by my frustration
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.100]   because I get a lot of email.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.140]   Because people know that I like-- that I currently--
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.860]   and I'm not saying I'm a fanboy.
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.260]   I currently recommend Macs to a lot of home users, especially
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.620]   saying there's no spyware, there's no viruses.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.580]   This is a good choice for you.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.660]   And so the Windows fanboys just hate it.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.420]   And they cannot wait to rub it in my face.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.620]   And I will get a lot of mail saying, see?
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.740]   There's a virus, see?
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.540]   And instead of them looking and seeing that it is, in fact,
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.980]   not much of a virus.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.220]   Well, and I also think that I think
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.540]   that to make OS 10 a really viable target,
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.420]   it would have to crest over 25% or 30% of the market, which
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.180]   I don't think it actually can.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.860]   I only go with 10% of this point.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.820]   I don't think-- I don't want it to.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.060]   I don't want it to either.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.060]   I think that--
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.940]   It's like people like it are growing right.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.500]   Well, but we're talking about--
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   we're talking about-- it's a great-- but our favorite band,
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.700]   I mean, the thing is, is that you're talking about--
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.500]   Go ahead, get that.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.540]   I know you want to answer it.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.420]   Is that-- is he's answering it?
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.580]   Yeah, put him on.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.820]   Get him on the question for it.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.140]   See if they have a question for us.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.020]   He feels about Mac virus.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.180]   We did that at night last Sunday night, Amber and I,
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.180]   the new live show that we're trying out.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.580]   And she's-- we're on Skype.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.220]   She says, oh, I see Steve Chen, the founder of YouTube,
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:05.940]   is on Skype.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.820]   Let's just call him.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.620]   And we-- we prank called Steve Chen.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.180]   And you know, I can't-- I couldn't get him to answer the question.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.260]   And I wish-- I kind of-- once I'm in that mode, right,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.700]   it's the DJ thing comes out.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.140]   I said, well, how when you get a check for 1.65 billion,
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.500]   does it-- does it come in your inbox at work?
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.580]   Where exactly?
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.700]   How do you get that checked?
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.020]   Is it mailed to you?
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.020]   How do you deposit it?
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.380]   You know, you can't bring it to the bank.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.380]   Say, here's 1.65 billion.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.260]   I'd like to put half in savings and half in my checking.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.180]   Goes in the giant novelty size deposit and all those cash back.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.260]   What do you-- what do you do?
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.940]   You know?
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.820]   But he-- he said, no, no, it's stock.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.860]   I don't see any money.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.360]   And--
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.180]   So Alex, who was that?
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.220]   Was anything you need to handle now?
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.140]   There wasn't me.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.060]   Actually, that was me.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.740]   Steve Jobs was calling to ask me some things.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.980]   So Scott, this Macarena-- actually, I know what he was asking.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.340]   So how do we implement this folder structure that--
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.580]   Alex wants so much.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.860]   Oh, you mock me.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.700]   I do mock you.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.340]   I mock you, my friend.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.780]   I mock you.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.460]   Other top stories for the Macintosh generation.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.780]   The Zoom is coming.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.980]   The Zoom.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.820]   I think that's what it's called, right?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.020]   I heard of that.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.740]   I heard of the Zoom.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.900]   Do you think, you know, more and more, we're seeing--
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.780]   well, there was-- actually, we talked about this on Twitter
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.820]   on Sunday.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:33.020]   Apple leaked a document by accident, a PDF document.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.980]   It was describing some obscure feature.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   You know, how to use notes on your iPod, something-- you know,
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.900]   who cares.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.980]   But in it, it's specifically said, now,
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.820]   if you're using the touch screen iPod--
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.940]   Right.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.820]   Whoa.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.140]   Did you--
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:46.820]   Well, we all know it.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.540]   Did you hear the resolution?
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.940]   No, did you hear the resolution on it?
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.980]   No, what'd they say?
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.580]   Well, supposedly, it was a typo.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.580]   OK, wait a minute.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.180]   Let me just write this down.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.020]   Touch screen.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.660]   Oh, he meant to say--
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.160]   What?
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.020]   --torch screen.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.220]   He meant to say--
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:01.720]   Touche.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.220]   I'm not trying to get all Tony's show.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.020]   Touche, you're screem.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.020]   I'm just saying.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.860]   I'm not--
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.940]   I'm assuming I can find the link.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.420]   But I--
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.020]   Oh, touch, story, and that's the good deal.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.260]   He meant to say touch wheel.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:12.680]   Uh-oh.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.180]   That's a touch--
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.020]   You don't buy it?
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.700]   No.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.260]   You know what?
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.780]   What I find interesting is that the Zoom, you know,
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.620]   as I said, we're all kind of like, oh, we'll see.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.020]   And I was in a meeting with a bunch of media folks today.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.500]   And I was like, you know, and I
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.820]   refer to Microsoft's soapbox.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.460]   And they had never heard of it.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.820]   I mean, they had never heard of--
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.940]   and this is Microsoft's thing that they're kind of putting
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.440]   out in there.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.700]   It's their YouTube killer.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.940]   They're like, kind of their YouTube.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.740]   But I was amazed at how much Apple--
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.780]   you know, Apple has a misspelled--
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.020]   a quote unquote--
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.340]   And they get all this coverage, right?
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.260]   They get all this coverage.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.980]   And Microsoft is this big company
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.340]   that isn't able to get their word out at all anymore.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.860]   Well, I mean, they've got a lot more products in Apple.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.460]   That's true.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.180]   I mean, soapbox is just one of about 800 web initiatives
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.780]   going on right now in Microsoft.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.700]   And it's actually pretty interesting.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.500]   I mean, that's probably more interesting, I think,
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.060]   than Zoom at the moment.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.060]   The reviewer I read-- and I can't remember
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.780]   if it was ours Technica or CNET, but liked it.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.900]   So it's pretty good.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.940]   There's no thoughts on it.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.980]   Yeah, there's nothing on it.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.500]   No, no, no.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.140]   But I like the structure of soapboxes.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.620]   It's actually, I think, much better than YouTube or a lot
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.820]   of other stuff.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.220]   Well, it's much easier.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.700]   You can be sorting through other videos
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.100]   while you're watching a video.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.380]   So you're not stuck in the YouTube interface.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.700]   Very modal, yeah.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.820]   And so this one, you can be looking through stuff
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.220]   and sorting it and thinking about what you want to do next
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.540]   while you're watching the video that you're watching.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.100]   And there's not much on it right now,
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.500]   but it's the big issue.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.980]   But it's in beta.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.660]   But ultimately, whether it's my space or Facebook, YouTube
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.060]   or soapbox, it isn't about design, ease of use.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.860]   It's about what's on there and who's on there.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.340]   In the end, absolutely.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.500]   And there's the key is--
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   Guys, eat, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.820]   That's all I care about.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.180]   That was the big story was that I think these Mentos guys
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.020]   must have shopped their new video around
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.140]   and they got a deal from Google so they didn't go to Revor
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.060]   this time.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.980]   And Google announced, yeah, we'll do revenue sharing.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.260]   And I think that was their way to get the diet Mentos guy.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.020]   They're the fresh makers.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.380]   Fresh.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.260]   So has anybody played with a new Mac mail?
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.740]   I had--
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.900]   I played with it.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.420]   What do you think?
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.500]   That's awesome.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.220]   It's awesome.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.380]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.460]   I mean, I have to--
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.780]   It looks just like Apple Mail.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.300]   It's just like Apple Mail.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.380]   I didn't even--
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.860]   I mean, I understand the whole Web 2.0 and AJAX
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.420]   and all that stuff.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.540]   But it was amazing.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.060]   I mean, I couldn't believe how much it was like the new Mail.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.900]   I obviously--
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.300]   You'll have to have a .Mac account.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.140]   And if you do, you can go to Mac.com
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.940]   and you can sign in and you'll see when you go to your mail,
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.740]   a whole new interface.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.100]   It looks just like Apple Mail.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.140]   I didn't use the Mail on the .Mac Mail on the web,
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.300]   just because it just drove me--
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.620]   Web Mail drives me absolutely crazy.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.800]   I just won't use it.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.240]   It just makes me insane.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.880]   And now I'm actually using it a lot more because of that.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.740]   It's actually a much, much better interface.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.100]   I hate to bring on your parade there, Alex, a little bit.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.560]   But one of the big holes in it for me
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.720]   is that you don't have a way to mark junk mail like you do
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.660]   in the regular Mail like now.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.120]   There's no junk button.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.720]   And since all of us on these podcasts get lots of junk mail,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.400]   that was problematic for me.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.880]   Now, do you know that you can separate your mail?
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.960]   I haven't done this with this yet.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.080]   But you know, I have a--
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.200]   you can build aliases within the .Mac account.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.600]   So if you have a .Mac account, you
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.040]   can have, I think, up to five aliases.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.320]   And so I have one that's like junkola@mac.com.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.280]   And I just use that for everything that I want to be able to get
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.240]   the mail and respond and put it on and sign up for something.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.880]   I'm kind of surprised that it doesn't have some sort
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   of junk mail filtering.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.960]   That just seems like kind of unnecessary these days.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.480]   I mean, Hotmail's got it.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   Google's got it.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.000]   Well, what do you think?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.200]   So back in the days in my web design days,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.240]   we used to have this one guy in the office who we always
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.520]   called Mr. Just a Button, because he always came in and said,
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.240]   oh, put up a button.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   Just have a button.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.360]   Let's people buy things on the site.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.120]   Just put up a button.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.600]   This is the guy who designed Eudora, no doubt.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.720]   But what is the junk in your notional edition here?
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   What is the junk button hooked up to?
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.680]   Well, it doesn't even need a junk button.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.400]   It needs at least junk.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.040]   It's spustering filtering.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.880]   Well, OK, but that's the question I'm getting at.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.040]   Are you saying is it just a glorified delete button
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.920]   with a pretty trash can?
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.080]   Or what's the functionality?
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.360]   You know, you're just so cynical, young Merlin.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.320]   Am I Scott?
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:26.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.000]   You know what?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I invented sarcasm.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.040]   Dot mail.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.320]   There's a junk button.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.360]   And you have a regular--
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:32.840]   Yes.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.480]   The mail app.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.440]   You have a junk button.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.600]   The same functionality so that you can mark things as junk.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.080]   And then in the future, when mail comes from that address,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.920]   the mail client is smart enough to say, don't make Scott.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.440]   Look at it.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.200]   OK, so it's just a blacklist.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   It's just a bore.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.880]   No, but Scott, you're smarter than this.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.160]   Is it adding it to a blacklist?
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.320]   Or is it using it as fodder for a system?
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.440]   Scott, you're smarter than this?
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.760]   Scott, I would be insulted if he said that.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.720]   Well, that's the funny thing is that's probably the closest
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.360]   I'm ever going to get to an actual compliment.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.400]   Scott, you're smarter than that.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   No, wait a minute.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.160]   Wait a minute, Merlin.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.480]   Let's talk about what Gmail does.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.800]   Can I just say something?
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.040]   Well, you guys were talking about that?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.320]   I just want to say one thing is that I actually
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.520]   added a folder in the .Mac mail and called it junk.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.600]   And it immediately gave me a junk icon.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.560]   Like it immediately identified that as junk.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.480]   Ooh, Easter egg.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.840]   And so--
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.360]   You're right.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.000]   It does say it's junk.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.520]   It immediately gives you that.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.320]   So I don't know whether-- I have to get some junk mail now
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.600]   to know whether it's actually working.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.000]   Google Mail, Gmail has two-stage junk filtering.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.080]   One is it has pretty good spam filters in it.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   And that's what I'm thinking.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.240]   Not Mac Mail is lacking.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.160]   It's just built in spam filters.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.840]   You could do a fairly good job of that.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.080]   And automatically sends things to a junk filter.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.680]   The other thing Google Mail has is a report spam button.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.960]   Now, who knows if that's wired to anything.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.880]   My presumption would be that it's
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.200]   using some sort of collaborative filtering like Brightmail.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   And then when you report something as spam,
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.040]   if enough people report it as spam,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.560]   it has now become spam and has added to the filter list.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.440]   Let me look at the code.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.320]   It says everything there goes to Leo at Leo.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.520]   It might be what happens.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.560]   It might well be what happens.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.640]   But Google has pretty good spam filtering.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   Well, it's--
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.720]   It's not great.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.600]   Yeah, I think I'm just trying to-- because I've
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.440]   taken a bunch of different approaches over time
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.360]   in trying to deal with this problem on the client level.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.320]   And so Leo, for example, have you used--
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.800]   we talked about this a little bit--
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.280]   on Fast Mail, have you used the Civ functionality?
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.040]   OK, so I mean, there's several ways you can do this.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.600]   There's a kind of overt ways where you go in and say, OK,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.480]   here is the level of false positives, for example,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.280]   that I can tolerate.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.640]   So I can say, in my case, I've clamped down really hard.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.520]   It's worth it to me to potentially lose some kitty photos
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.720]   if it keeps a lot of the biacra out.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.000]   And I think in the case of Gmail, what it's doing is saying--
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.840]   I suspect what it's saying is add this to the big THE big pile
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.280]   of spam that we use to improve our algorithm.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.680]   So I wasn't trying to be snide.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.800]   I'm just saying that, for example, in Mail.app,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.640]   it's adding it to the Bayesian equation.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.360]   It's saying include this in the corpus
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.880]   that we use to--
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.380]   That's right.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.240]   --the Bayesian filtering.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.160]   So my question was-- the apparently snarky question I asked
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.720]   was, what does that button do when you hit junk?
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.160]   Is it just black listing it?
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   Or should that add it to a sieve corpus?
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.120]   It should add it to a sieve corpus.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.080]   That's an excellent response.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.880]   I'll take B, Alex.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.480]   It should add it to a sieve corpus.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.560]   Can you phrase that in the form of a question, Scott?
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.520]   Yeah, can you tell me what the heck a sieve corpus is?
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.040]   Thank you, guys.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.080]   Anybody else use spam sieve?
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.960]   Bayesian corpus.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.480]   He's talking about a Bayesian corpus.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.200]   I use an app.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.040]   I use an app like--
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   Hey, this in habeas corpus was just ruled illegal by the question
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.480]   that is a sieve.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:46.980]   All right.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.880]   I'm going to go on time.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.000]   All right, let's explain.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.480]   I'll tell you the best way to handle spam.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.960]   It's a three-stage filtering technique.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.600]   Think of spam as sewage.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.320]   So you've got to get the lumps out first.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:01.960]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.160]   OK, that's the settling tank.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.480]   You have to put it in a city park on Riverside Drive.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.680]   That's right.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.760]   Just for fragrance.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.640]   And then it's important to chlorinate.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640]   What do you do?
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.240]   What do you do at the lumps?
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.800]   Once you get them out?
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.040]   Can we just not go there, please?
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.360]   Is that a facetious question?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.440]   Or do you really want to know?
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.640]   I'm just begging you, man.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.200]   They go into the lump corpus.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.480]   I'll owe you one if we could just not go there.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.800]   What I use-- and I think this is--
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.880]   I have actually very effective spam filtering,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.680]   and I need it, because people like Scott give out
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   my email address all the time.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.240]   And so I've had Leo at LeoVille.com for 10 years.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.200]   So I get-- and get ready for this, kids--
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.000]   1 million spam messages a month.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.600]   And I know that, because my service provider tells me.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:51.720]   Of all my email, only 0.01% is actual mail.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.240]   I get--
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:52.880]   That's awful.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.840]   It's really bad.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.680]   So I get--
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.880]   So 30,000 good messages a month.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.920]   999,970,000 bad messages a month.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.600]   And the way that I handle it is I have a service provider that
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.080]   does this kind of gross filtering.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.920]   They just get the stuff that's so egregious.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.240]   There's no chance of a false positive.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.800]   There's no chance that it's my mother sending me an ad
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.160]   for a big-breasted Latinas.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.720]   And to do that, they're relying on a lot of information
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.760]   to share between thousands of apps.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.080]   Collaborative filtering.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.440]   Real-time filtering.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.720]   Real-time collaborative filtering.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.760]   That really works.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.480]   If enough--
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.000]   It works great.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.840]   And this is how Bright Mail works.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.200]   And there's a number of other services.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   Only my email is a good one.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.280]   I use mail route, which is actually commercial.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.840]   It's not available to end users.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.280]   I've told you about island mail, I think, Merlin.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.720]   That's one of the companies it uses.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   But what that does is very effective--
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.840]   I don't know what the algorithm is.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.360]   But let's say nine people say this is spam.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.280]   It's spam.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.960]   There's no question.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.160]   It's spam now.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.840]   It's saying anything over a 15 is or whatever.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.760]   It's saying--
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.520]   Now you're talking about using spam sieve or spam a sassy--
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.760]   Well, it's whatever the--
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.200]   Exactly.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   Or whatever it's equivalent version of that.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.360]   It's saying, gosh, it's really, really unlikely.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:08.600]   Right.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   That, yeah, exactly.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.640]   And I've planned to use spam assassin a little bit,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.000]   setting the scores high and low to look at what you get.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.520]   And it's true.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.360]   Anything over in spam assassin, anything over a nine or 10.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.040]   There's no question.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.680]   It's just--
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.440]   Is your second level on your mail server?
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.280]   It's then it's fast mail.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.440]   It's spam assassin.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.640]   OK, sure.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.920]   And then I use spam assassin when I--
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.040]   now it's scoring.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.840]   And I'll say, OK, well, I'd like to see anything above--
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.000]   I mean, I want to see everything below a five,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.440]   I want to see.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.640]   Actually, it should be below a six.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.160]   I get occasional false positives in the 5/6 range.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:38.960]   Anything above a six.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.480]   I really don't want to see.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.160]   And then I use spam sieve locally.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.680]   So I have three stage filtering.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   And it works pretty well.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.240]   Anybody else here using spam sieve?
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.760]   Spam sieve is excellent.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.320]   I've been trying-- yeah, Michael Sy.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.080]   He does great stuff.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.200]   I've been training it over time.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.080]   The nice thing about spam sieve is it really exposes
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.920]   the corpus meaning all of the email
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.680]   that it's using to make this determination.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.400]   And so you train, like with the Bayesian stuff in mail.app,
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:03.920]   you train it.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.160]   And you say, this is a good message.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.920]   This is a bad message.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.680]   And you try and keep that balance of what Leo, about 60/40.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.920]   You want about 60% spam.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.440]   Well, yes.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.040]   Close as you can get to 50/50, I think, is ideal.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.520]   But if it gets too much in one direction,
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.960]   then you have less--
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.760]   This is what I love about spam sieve.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.040]   Once you've used it for a couple weeks,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.480]   you can go in and look at your corpus.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.600]   I'm looking at my corpus now.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.040]   It's really fun.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.480]   And it's really cool.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.080]   So you'll see all this stuff that you never, in a million
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.480]   years, could have groct on your own.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.080]   You'll see these weird--
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.160]   there's some words that, for whatever reason,
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.840]   they seem like a perfectly normal word.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.960]   You can sort by the probability of spam, for instance.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.480]   Down to a probability of one.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.840]   If I have quite a few words that are a certainty,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.760]   that if it has the word hack and sack in it, I'm not kidding.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.640]   If it has the word--
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.520]   That's the hack and sack in it.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.160]   Now, see, to me, that's spurious.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.880]   Because what if somebody sent me an email
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.160]   with a word hack and sack?
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:54.880]   That's the beauty part.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.600]   Because then you've also got a whitelist.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.200]   And you've got a whitelist to fight with.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.920]   And it goes, OK, if it's from, less than such person,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.400]   or it has this kind of header in it.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.880]   So anyway, that's what's smart about it.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   KitchenAid also is a certainty of one.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.760]   KitchenAid.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.560]   But now remember, this is my email.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.800]   And that's the other beauty of this.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.000]   This is totally tuned to what I get.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.320]   Not anybody else.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.680]   That's right.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.160]   And we were wondering why we didn't have very many New Jersey
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.760]   lists.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.600]   All the hack and sack listeners.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   But this doesn't-- now, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.440]   But I think, Merlin, that just because that word has a probability
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.440]   of one doesn't mean that that's going to be flagged as--
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.200]   I mean, I barely understand this.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.080]   I don't understand how the water gets in my house.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.840]   So I certainly don't understand how spam filtering works.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.400]   But the part of this that I do understand
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.560]   is that the beauty part is that each one of these words
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.640]   is evaluated separately.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.600]   And then it makes a determination based on the net facts.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.240]   I mean, if there is stuff in there that's really good,
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.360]   and it's--
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.240]   that's the neat part.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:46.760]   It's learning.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.400]   It's an algorithm.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   It learns, it learns, it learns.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.880]   And whenever I get male, for instance, to Leo's hair
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.400]   at some address, it's guaranteed that, no, I'm not
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.320]   going to keep you laughing, I get several thousand messages
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.040]   a month to Leo's hair at leoville.com.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.560]   So I would say one thing.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.920]   If you're running a shared account that has basically a catch
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.840]   all, I used to love having a catch all, which just
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.080]   means anything at thusandsuch.com comes to you.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.300]   One of the best things you can do is to shut off the catch
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:12.920]   all.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.840]   Because right now, spam was reward dialing, basically
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.840]   dictionary, attacks to spam you.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.560]   So that's one of the very first things you can do,
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.960]   is come up with some kind of a nonce word that is actually
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.720]   your true email address.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   So you're saying, don't-- oh, I see.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.880]   So anything that comes to leoville.com at all, I'll take.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:33.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.640]   I absolutely do that.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.120]   But the thing is--
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.160]   anything that doesn't have a Leo's hair, for instance,
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.000]   is immediately goes to the bit bucket.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.440]   That's right.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.280]   That's right.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.760]   And just throughout that URL, Michael Sighs--
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.440]   is that how you pronounce it, Michael Sighs?
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.440]   Sigh, yeah.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   Sigh.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   T-S-A-I.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.360]   T-M-J-T-S-A-I.com.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.920]   You can learn more about spam.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   Spam-Sighs is--
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.000]   I mean, I think it's the best program for the Mac.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.520]   I don't know of any better program.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.240]   And my corpus is massive.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.400]   In fact, it warms me frequently that I have a giant corpus.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.840]   At least a 17-inch corpus.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.560]   Since your corpus is so big.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.520]   I was just waiting.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.800]   I was counting down for that.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.320]   Now, do you ever prune your corpus?
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.560]   Well, it sounds like it'd be painful.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.480]   Yeah, well, my family was raised Protestant,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.920]   so they didn't need to prune my corpus.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.440]   But--
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.800]   It's a tradition in my family.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.440]   Well, for hygienic reasons, I sometimes
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.040]   like to get in there and really just lean it out.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.240]   But you know, if you prune your corpus,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.880]   greatly reduces your chance of catching a disease.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.440]   Now, the news spams have just came out.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.320]   I see that there is no prune corpus command.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.080]   There's a reset corpus, but you can no longer prune your corpus.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.400]   Now, I mean, like all these things,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.360]   it's worth saying that this will take a little bit of time.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.280]   You do need to train it.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.160]   But that's just true of the junk mail as well.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.400]   Are you guys pretty satisfied with your junk mail
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.320]   on your mail apps?
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.520]   Yeah, mine's about 90--
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.320]   I'd say about 99% accurate, but I still
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.520]   go through my junk folder once a day to make sure I'm not
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.040]   missing anything.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.760]   Yeah, I suspect that so much of that
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   is what Leo described at that very highest level.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.680]   I think this has become such a business problem.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.080]   I saw a stat-- I forget where maybe in the week.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.040]   I saw a stat that now it's 91% of the email out there
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   is spam.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.400]   Oh, my god.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.200]   And so this is a business problem.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.760]   You know, if you're AOL or for that matter,
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.560]   if you're fast mail, that's your page for just--
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.360]   Well, and what's fascinating is that what I didn't realize
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.760]   until I was talking to Ben Durbin here
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.440]   is that there's this whole thing where you get these images.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.200]   You know, like I didn't realize a lot of the spam
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.160]   was getting more images of stock, whatever.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.240]   That's the big one right now.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.480]   That's the current scan.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.760]   And what they'll do is--
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   Your way over is Alex way over modulating.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.360]   And can you turn it down?
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.360]   I don't know what happened.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.760]   It went up.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   You got excited.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.280]   Is that better?
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:46.880]   Yeah, you got excited.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.840]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.160]   No, I dragged something off the desk
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   and then put it back on.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.680]   Stop fiddling.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.920]   I just fiddled around.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.000]   I just moved and it fell.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.280]   I didn't fiddle anything.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.200]   So anyway, the--
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.440]   Nelikilun.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.040]   So one of the things that Ben was describing
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.280]   is that they had this--
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.520]   there's images.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.000]   But a lot of the stuff you'll see
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.040]   is there'll be a bunch of good words
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.080]   and a bunch of coherent stuff, sometimes--
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   Right.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.200]   Stuff from Shakespeare, stuff from--
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.960]   All these things that--
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   Very hard to filter.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.800]   Yeah, I get a ton.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.360]   Only reason--
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:14.920]   Well--
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.240]   If you keep on telling your junk mail that that's junk,
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.560]   it actually is--
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.240]   I have a trick for that.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.120]   --uses the junk mail.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.040]   I have a trick for that.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   That would be hard for that.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.600]   Because I would like to--
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.320]   --have a trick for that?
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:24.840]   Yes.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840]   Yes.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.440]   I either got--
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.600]   Yeah, it's brutal.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.480]   I either got this.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.120]   I know I got this from Howie, Matt Howie,
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.320]   at a whole lot of nothing.org, which
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.600]   might have previously come from Life Hacker.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.440]   But the trick is you want a mail rule that goes thusly.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.200]   If all of these things are met.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.120]   Number one, content type contains
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.680]   multi-part slash related.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.160]   And any attachment contains Jeff,
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.920]   or you can also screen on for JPG.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.520]   And the sender is not on my previous recipients list.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.280]   And that multi-part related thing appears
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.520]   to be a big part of catching it.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.960]   And I have-- so far, I've been--
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.760]   What is multi-part?
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   It's not related.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   I've never heard that's a mime type.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   But I've never heard of that mime type.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   That's a mime type.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.040]   And apparently, it's-- I don't know.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   I followed the recipe.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.960]   And this has helped me a lot.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.760]   And so what I did was I said, move it in junk mail
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.680]   and make it a crazy, super dark red.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.400]   And then I just go in and review that periodically.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.160]   And so far, it has not yet been anything that's been useful.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.880]   This is unfortunately kind of a necessity with--
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.680]   Totally a hack.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.040]   But--
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.720]   Well, you have to do this because what happens
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.560]   is the spam filters work well until something
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.400]   like this comes along.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.800]   And then the whole thing collapses.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.440]   Spazian, whatever, it just doesn't work anymore.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.400]   And you might have to have an ad hoc rule or two.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.440]   That's kind of the irony of it.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.800]   The idea behind spam assassin is that it's all ad hoc rules
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.400]   or mostly.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.360]   Well, that's what Alex pointed out that makes it so brutal,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.560]   is if it's got any kind of sensible text in it at all,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.800]   you end up screwing up your own filler.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.840]   That's why you sometimes get an email with three pages
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.160]   from Moby Dick in it.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.760]   We should get Michael's sayon sometime and really ask him.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.640]   Because anybody who's in the thick of this
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.040]   probably can tell you a lot about what spammers are doing
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.800]   right now.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.080]   Be interesting.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.480]   If they're putting in Moby Dick and pieces from books,
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.440]   I actually think that's something that's really spam,
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.720]   because no one writes emails like that.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.560]   You know when I do--
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.040]   Proper pros, everything.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   How do you filter against proper pros?
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:10.960]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.880]   I'm just--
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.960]   Oh my god, the punctuation filter is going off the--
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.800]   I mean, what are you--
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.720]   Anybody else have an effective spam technique
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.080]   that they'd like to share with the audience?
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   I have an assistant.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.200]   I wanted to use the Google email address thing,
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.000]   where I have an email address I give to friends,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.640]   and I have an email address I use publicly.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.000]   And that has worked very well.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.200]   Except after a while, no matter what you do.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   It's out of the bag.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.240]   You know, Steve Gibson--
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.200]   Steve Gibson for years.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.120]   Really?
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.720]   Yeah, I've never really had a problem.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.600]   And like Alex was mentioning, I use an alias every now
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.080]   and again, and I just turn the alias off.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   Yeah, I have--
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.960]   Once you start to get a heavy amount of junk mail, it's like,
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.280]   all right, I've got to turn that alias off
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.680]   and move on to the next one.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.160]   And I have codes that I get to tell people
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.360]   to put this in the subject line.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.200]   And if they put that in the subject line, it's sorted.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.600]   It's the first thing that happens
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.480]   is it gets sorted into a folder.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.360]   And I only get maybe--
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.000]   you know, those are things that are important.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.160]   And I only get maybe 15 emails a day that go into that folder
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.360]   at maximum, oftentimes no more than two or three.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.200]   And so people really need to get a hold of me.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.840]   A lot of times they'll use those--
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.160]   Yeah, that's what Jerry Pournell does.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.760]   He has kind of a random phrase if you put that in the subject
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   line.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.760]   Mine's not even random.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   It's initials.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   And you know, it's these initials.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Fastmail supports that.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.960]   You can-- and it's nice because you can change it anytime you want.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   Yeah, I use that.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.120]   And that's part of the--
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.240]   Fastmail has a great filtering language, Civ.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.000]   I wish it were more widely supported.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.480]   And what's nice is if you do, regardless of whether you do
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.760]   a fast mailer, whomever, you can go out there and there
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.760]   are these recipes that are amazing.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.000]   And you just basically pop--
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.200]   If you had proc mail access, you could do it as well.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.960]   It's just-- it's this really sophisticated if--
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.280]   you know, ifs ands ors.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.200]   It's, I guess, kind of basic Boolean logic of saying,
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.680]   if any of these things happen.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.040]   And what's beautiful is you can actually also make these really
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.080]   sexy autorespond filters to say, if any of these subject lines
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.360]   come up automatically send this response and so on.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.680]   It's really powerful.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.120]   I haven't played with as much as I'd like to.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.960]   But I have, for instance, a vacation message that I'll use.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.280]   But I also have a--
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   if you send me something more than 3 megabytes,
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.360]   you'll get a special message that says, you know, I don't take
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.640]   that, but please use this.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.880]   It is-- it seems like that could be very handy
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.400]   if you really know what you were doing with that.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.120]   So Scott, what do you do about email?
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.560]   I have an assistant named Lisa who takes care of you.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.680]   Yes, Thurston just hires people.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.200]   You know, I find human-- there's no substitute for human labor.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.080]   And it's so cheap, don't you find?
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.520]   Well, they obtained me some by Agra.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.080]   I am interested in all of your Viagra emails, by the way.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.920]   But beyond that, actually to tell you the truth,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.200]   this has been a very helpful conversation for me
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.280]   because it's an area I don't have time to pay
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.240]   a lot of attention to.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:54.720]   Most people do.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   Most people do.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.240]   Most people do.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   Most people do.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.200]   And so I have to admit that I probably
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.360]   have far less skills in this area than our average listener.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.080]   But given this painfully long--
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   But I have a conversation.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.200]   I'm going to take some new steps.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.160]   Sorry, Scott.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.600]   Let me make you feel better for you.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.280]   iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.080]   Thank you.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.600]   Thank you.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:14.800]   Thank you.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.240]   There is no iPhone news.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.960]   I've been looking desperately for you.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   Oh, no.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.560]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, just hold on a minute.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:20.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.840]   I actually have some.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.840]   I have some.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.080]   There is iPhone news, Alex.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.680]   Is the NS--
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.800]   is the iPhone in the Holy Grail of podcasting?
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.240]   I don't know if it's really news.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.800]   It's some guy in it.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.880]   It's some blog that mentioned iPhone.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.680]   But it's an excuse to talk about the iPhone.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.880]   I just got a new phone from a T-Mobile called the Dash.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.040]   It's an HTC.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.680]   I like HTC's phones a lot.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.400]   It's the tornado, I think.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.360]   And I'm liking a lot.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.880]   It's Windows Mobile.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.280]   But it does-- Windows Mobile now
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.440]   syncs pretty well using missing sync.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.720]   I've been pretty happy with the results.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.360]   Yes, it does.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.640]   I use the 3125 on Singular.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.440]   It does the same thing.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.200]   It's very well.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.400]   I think they're finally getting it
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.920]   so that you can actually use a Windows Mobile
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.240]   machine with a Mac.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.360]   I hope you got a short contract, because soon and very soon--
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.480]   They'll be the iPhone.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.240]   I know.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.240]   I showed it to my daughter.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.120]   She said, OK, I'm waiting for the iPhone.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.000]   I just keep on swearing at my trio.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.160]   But you know, I--
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.480]   Scottborn has a lot in common with a 14-year-old girl
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.000]   named Abby.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.600]   I just want to point that out.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.240]   Thank you so much for sharing that with you.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.400]   Now you know why I've changed my picture, Scott.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.040]   Maybe you should change your picture.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.600]   They both have my space pages to claim they're 15.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.040]   No, thank you so much.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.400]   Let's see.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.440]   What else?
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.480]   What other stories does anybody have?
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.120]   Anything of great interest?
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   Have we really concluded the--
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.760]   I think yes, we have the spam.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.640]   I think we've beaten it into the ground.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.800]   We have run that into the ground.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.200]   People are interested, though.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:52.760]   I mean--
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.120]   You know, it's the thing about spam.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.360]   This is--
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.240]   I don't deal with it.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:55.680]   We do.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.560]   And part of the problem with spam is it's one of those things.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.040]   There's those old kind of skenarian things
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.560]   you can do with attention where--
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.360]   it's sort of the way that you get people
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.920]   to gamble because it doesn't pay off all the time.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.600]   I mean, if a slot machine paid off all the time,
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.720]   no one would ever use it.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.000]   It wouldn't be gambling.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.800]   And I think there's a similar kind of thing
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.640]   in a much more nefarious way happening with spam.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.520]   It's stealing these little micro slices of our attention
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.360]   on a frequent enough basis, this kind of mad name.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   It's paying--
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.160]   But you're being nibbled to death.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.800]   It's not like--
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.440]   I think I'm really starting to take that whole approach.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   I think we should really take a more Islamic approach of--
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.240]   if you're sending out more than--
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.360]   let's say, well, we'll make the number high-- a million spam,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.840]   a million emails a month, which is more than I
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.440]   send out significantly.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.200]   I think someone should just come to your house
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.120]   and cut one of your fingers off.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.200]   And every time you do it, they just cut it off.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.320]   And after 10 months, you're pretty much--
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.400]   You're done.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.360]   You're done?
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:56.720]   You're done.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.200]   I really think that that would be very effective.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:58.960]   I think if you did it--
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.160]   We can't find these guys.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.320]   That's the problem.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.480]   A lot of these guys are.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.720]   They just can't catch them.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.120]   I have some non-spam related news.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.600]   All right.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.080]   There's been a rumor on one of the rumor sites
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:16.840]   that the MacBook, the MacBook Core 2 Duo, is available.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.240]   And there's a site taking pre-orders from it,
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.480]   one of the online media--
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.400]   No, that's an error.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.280]   That's got to be an error.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.440]   Don't you think that they should keep the MacBook
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.480]   of Core 2 so that it's very clearly distinguished
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.640]   from the MacBook Pro?
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.320]   That was always the problem with the MacBook Pro.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   I'm simply telling you the MacBook Pro.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.440]   There was very little difference.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.320]   Although the Intel part probably isn't much more expensive,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.800]   so why not have everything be Core 2?
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.520]   I'm starting to really regret the anemic video in my MacBook.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.720]   Well, in the other news here--
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.560]   This is where you were having the presentation problems.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.760]   It was kind of going too slow for you.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.840]   I love the form factor.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.720]   And in a way, I would like a MacBook that
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.000]   had a faster processor and a fact.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.040]   Because I like the form factor.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.840]   I like the size.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.360]   I wish that it had a PCMCAA slot so I could put it.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.440]   Yeah, I really--
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.960]   That really burns my butt.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.080]   What would you put in there, Brett?
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.400]   What do you need to do?
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.160]   Well, I have the Verizon Express card for my MacBook Pro.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.360]   So whenever I travel, I can pop on and get online.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.960]   That's their EVDO high speed.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.440]   Yeah, there's--
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.120]   And that works with a Mac?
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.040]   Yeah, somebody was asking me that because I think
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.600]   the singular does not.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.080]   The Verizon does.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.360]   It certainly doesn't support it.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.200]   The Verizon One, their Verizon connection manager software
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   has always worked with the Mac.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:30.640]   Oh, that's good.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.560]   It works great.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.880]   And it's fast.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.120]   That's really good.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.080]   I love the Black MacBook.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:36.800]   I think it's a slick--
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.320]   I do too.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.880]   You're very happy with it.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.120]   Unless you're guaranteed a Wi-Fi, you're not
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.840]   going to get online.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   Right.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.000]   Right.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.800]   Yeah, a lot of PC laptops are coming built in
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.840]   with the singular or the Verizon EVDO in it.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.560]   Singular edge or the Verizon EVDO in it.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.280]   Automatically.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.120]   Just cool.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.840]   You know all this talk we have about the new core to dual MacBook
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.400]   Pro and potentially MacBook, we don't
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.840]   want to forget that one of the big changes to the MacBook
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:12.440]   Pro is 33% more RAM capacity, which is important to some of these.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.000]   I mean, you know, go to three gigs instead of two gigs.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.360]   Yes, which is very important.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.080]   Seems an artificial barrier though.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.000]   Why three gigs?
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.480]   Why not four gigs?
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.840]   Well, I don't know what addressability problem.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.320]   No, I think it was helping.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.120]   I believe it was actually an Intel infrastructure problem.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:27.920]   Oh, it is then.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.680]   I haven't read it in front of me.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.520]   Yeah, it was an infrastructure issue.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.720]   It's a motherboard issue.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.040]   With what it could address.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.280]   All I know is it's more than two, which is better.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.640]   Hall.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.600]   Hall.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.480]   It's for me.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.040]   It is better.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.640]   It's better.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.760]   It would be better for me.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.720]   I just ordered a--
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.200]   I haven't actually sitting here by my computer.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.400]   Now I have to have enough time to do it.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.080]   I just bought a new 160 gig drive for my laptop.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.160]   Because the 100 gig is just like--
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.920]   I have like two gigs open all the time, which
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.320]   is not really good for the drive.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.280]   And so because the boot camp, which I need to use--
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.640]   I know that everyone likes parallels,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.160]   but I need to use it for some of the graphics applications
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.240]   that won't run in parallels or won't run well.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.760]   So I give up 30 gigs to my--
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.040]   to the windows.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.880]   And then I have--
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.400]   so I'm getting this new thing.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.680]   But having 160 gigs makes a big difference,
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.160]   as much RAM as I can pile into almost any computer I get
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:21.920]   is pretty much.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.880]   But of course, that's because I do graphics.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.800]   And I think for the average person running around,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.520]   I think that there's not a--
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.520]   I don't know if it's really that important.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.640]   But I know for me, for graphics, the more RAM I can throw it in.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.920]   RAM is one of the fastest-- one of the easiest ways
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.240]   to speed up your computer, at least in graphics.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.760]   But anything that uses big files,
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.960]   RAM will speed up your computer more cheaply and more quickly
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.800]   than almost anything else out there.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.560]   That's all I have to say.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.060]   That's my story.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.560]   I'm sticking to it.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.560]   One thing that I forgot to tell Brett
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.600]   that we've started doing on Mac Break Weekly
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.920]   since you were on last is come up with a--
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.320]   No, I think actually we did it with you.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.160]   A Mac pick, a software pick that each of us--
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.640]   I think we've run out of stories.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.040]   So I think it might be time to do that.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.540]   OK.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.440]   Run through our quick self-verb.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.040]   Is that my turn?
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.920]   Yeah, I go ahead, Alex.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.320]   So there is a new application that was just released
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:16.800]   for the Mac this week called V-Tor by a company called RealViz.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.280]   And this is not particularly a cheap application,
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.680]   but it's a really cool application.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.320]   And they have a demo.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.400]   And it's worth just downloading it
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.120]   so you can play with a demo.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.160]   What V-Tor does is it lets you actually
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.840]   build a 3D environment.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.640]   You can build a 3D model out of a single photograph.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.240]   So yeah, it's really cool.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.640]   If you go up, it's realviz.com.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.040]   And you go up there.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.920]   And I just got it.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.720]   But we've had it on the PC for a little while.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.800]   And you literally take a photo.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.720]   And it's not really for doing out mountains or anything
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.520]   or organic.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.440]   But if you're in a street or your house or a room,
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.760]   you simply have to identify the corner of the room,
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   something that has a right angle, a couple right angles,
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.520]   where the X, Y, and Z would all meet somewhere.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.200]   And then you identify a couple lines that
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.520]   are parallel with those.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.560]   And boom, it figures out where the camera is.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.800]   It figures out what the-- and then you
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.440]   can start building walls and building pretty complicated
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.200]   models out of it.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:10.880]   It's--
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.120]   We've got a question on Google Earth.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.200]   You can.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.400]   You can export it out to Google Earth.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.960]   You are correct.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.760]   So it doesn't do the import export out of Google Earth
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.820]   that SketchUp does, where you can export a location
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.300]   from Google Earth into SketchUp and then back.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.720]   But you can export directly to Google Earth
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.360]   and then move it into place.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.920]   That's actually one of the big cool things that it does.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.140]   And it's a really nifty--
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.180]   I mean, they have other programs that are a lot more
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.100]   complicated and significantly more expensive.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.980]   But this one is just a really cool eye can.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.280]   Even if you never buy it, it's definitely worth checking out.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:50.780]   All right.
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.760]   That's my pick.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.460]   Say the name again.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.580]   It is called V-Tor.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.780]   V-T-O-U-O.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.780]   V-OR?
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.660]   Yep.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.900]   And it's at realvis.com.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.100]   V-Tor by Realvis.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.060]   And how much is it?
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.180]   I don't know what the retail is.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.300]   Everyone just sends me software.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.780]   So I think it's like 500 bucks or something like that.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.280]   Oh, OK.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.260]   Oh, whatever.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.260]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:11.780]   It's just money.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.460]   I don't know.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.300]   It's not my money.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:13.940]   So it's--
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.940]   It's money.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.900]   You know, it's just that it's a really--
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.420]   as I said, there's a free demo.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.020]   It's worth just checking out.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.580]   If enough people email them and say,
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.100]   I'd really buy this at $150.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.340]   Maybe they'll make a version that will work at a lower price.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:33.660]   Mr. Scott Borne, do you have my friend a pick?
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.580]   Well, I do.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.380]   And it's a tiny bit self-serving,
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.780]   but it's kind of exciting.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.300]   ApertureTricks.com, as you know, Leo,
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.260]   been going strong since way back to before the last Mac
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:46.180]   world almost a year now.
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.180]   Before they fired everybody on the Aperture team.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.260]   And they've heard about that.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.500]   They got rid of them all, didn't they?
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.820]   Anyway--
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.020]   Marilyn, you're stuck in the fire.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.060]   My blog has been absorbed.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:57.900]   What?
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.740]   It's been absorbed the Borg.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.100]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.700]   I'm proud to announce that in partnership
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:07.220]   with O'Reilly Digital Media and with the help of Apple,
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.900]   ApertureTricks is now part of Inside Aperture,
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.700]   which is a whole new big blog because big guy is not just
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.420]   me doing it.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.860]   O'Reilly's doing it.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.660]   And if you go to the apple.com hot news page,
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.460]   you'll see they're writing about us there.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.740]   Is it Inside Aperture.com?
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:25.900]   It's no, it's O'Reilly Digital Media's the place to go get it.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:26.900]   And then there's a link to it.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.020]   You can just get the link right off the hot news.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.620]   Apple.com/hotnews.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.860]   You'll see the link.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.660]   And we have put together the best photographers in the world
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.860]   in terms of people who understand Aperture.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.580]   And there's tons of tips and automator workflows,
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.460]   including some that our friends Sal has put together.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.620]   There's all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.140]   It's probably going to be the world's number one resource
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:47.780]   for Aperture.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.420]   So if you're into that, I'd like to invite you to stop on by.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.020]   Well, I will put a link in the show notes to it.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.780]   It says you said digitalmedia.org/aperture.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.540]   But that sounds great.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.420]   So no more Aperture tricks.
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.700]   Well, Aperture tricks is actually a small part.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.260]   There's a little feed on the right that
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.460]   says other Aperture news, which is actually
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.300]   fed via RSS from Aperture tricks.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.100]   But all of my postings now will be there instead of an Aperture
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.460]   trick.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:13.940]   Cool.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.060]   Very cool.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.140]   Anything for us, Brett?
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.460]   I don't want to spring this on you.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.180]   I forgot to warn you.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.660]   We do this.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.740]   Listen.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.140]   I am very happy to say I got a beta release of the sling player
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:24.940]   for the Macintosh.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.420]   Ooh.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.980]   As a longtime lover of the sling box,
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.940]   and I just recently got the new one, the sling box pro,
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.820]   I have to say, the sling player for the Mac,
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.740]   definitely awesome.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:36.780]   It works.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.020]   It works perfectly.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:38.380]   Yay.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.820]   It controls the video quality is excellent.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.500]   It's been nice, especially since I've
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.220]   had to do a couple of business trips lately.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.460]   And it's so nice to sit in the lonely hotel room watching
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.220]   the Simpsons.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.020]   I like sitting in the lonely hotel rooms, too.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.300]   Isn't that funny?
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.700]   I don't know if I like it, but I spend a lot of time doing it.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.820]   Well, I'm going to do mine, and then we'll give you a chance,
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:00.020]   Merlin.
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.660]   I like to end with yours, because they're always so wonderful.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.820]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.700]   I'm just trying to make it hard on your hair.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.540]   This is--
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.060]   Certainly.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.380]   Go ahead.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.260]   This is something I found.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.540]   It's an 1895 shareware called Menu Calendar Clock.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.220]   I-Caladition.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.260]   It's from Object Park Software.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.660]   Normally, I don't like to add too many things to my menu bar.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.300]   Although, if you look at my menu bar,
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.300]   there's quite a bit of stuff in there.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.820]   But this one is really, really useful.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.740]   Object Park.net.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.460]   You can try before you buy.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:31.900]   I've been looking for--
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.020]   basically replaces the clock in the toolbar.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.420]   Customizable clock, by the way.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.580]   You can add--
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.220]   you can actually easily-- unlike the Apple
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:42.820]   clock, you can easily modify what's in there in the clock.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.780]   But when you click on the clock--
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.260]   by the way, next to the clock, there's
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.780]   a little calendar icon with the day of the month, which, by itself,
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.540]   saves me a lot of time.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.340]   What is this called?
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:56.580]   It's called Menu Calendar Clock.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.980]   Menu Calendar Clock.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.940]   Wow.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.020]   So you get a little icon with the day of the month next to the day.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:04.860]   But then if you click on it, you get the month calendar
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.100]   and you get your I-Cal schedule for today.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.140]   You can have your to-do items in that as well.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.140]   And it's just very slick.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.020]   I just really find it very useful.
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.140]   It's one of those little applications
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.780]   that now I find it hard to live without.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.420]   And it integrates very nicely into--
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:26.220]   I've actually mapped it to F-15, but you can have a special key
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.860]   or you can just click on the icon.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.380]   And it's like 18 bucks.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.020]   Share where.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.340]   And now, my friends, the best--
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:34.860]   Drumroll.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.420]   Drumroll, please.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.020]   The best is yet to come from--
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.620]   just trying to get Merlin a hard time.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.460]   From Merlin, man.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.460]   What is your pick, my friend?
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.020]   Oh, man, that has lots of live up to.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:46.620]   You know what?
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.380]   Screw it.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:48.780]   They have not-- they have not--
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.780]   Not a--
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.260]   No, my mind is modest.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.940]   And it's for you edge players out there
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.660]   who don't mind getting a little bit of blood on your hands.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.020]   But there's an application--
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.100]   I don't know if you-- gosh, I don't even
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:58.940]   even call it an application.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:03.100]   There's a utility that I swear by that is called Applejack.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.060]   And Applejack is basically you run it and you install it.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.820]   And what it does is it installs a little bit of a script
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.220]   that you can run in single user mode.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.100]   And if you've ever had your computer go bye-bye,
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.020]   you know that single user mode is about the greatest thing
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:16.380]   in the world.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.820]   You start up and hold down Command S, Apple S,
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.500]   to bring up a screen that lets you do some Unix utilities
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.300]   to fix your dead disk.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.780]   This is not a really super sexy one,
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.140]   but there's this--
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:26.980]   No, but you know what?
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.820]   I would agree with you.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.220]   It's a must-have.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.140]   Everybody should have it installed.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.700]   Applejack is just terrific.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:32.900]   And here's what it does.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.740]   Let's say something's gone horribly wrong.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.300]   Let's say there's those weird kind of things that happen
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.380]   where sound can get messed up and even your monitor might not
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:42.060]   be working quite the right way.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.780]   This thing starts up in a shell.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.540]   It's just pure bash comes up.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.780]   And by typing in Applejack, return,
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.900]   you expose some of the basic tools for fixing some
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.580]   of the kind of low-level problems with your hard drive
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:57.500]   and with your system.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.940]   So it'll repair your disk.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:00.900]   It'll do it basically in FSCK to check
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:01.980]   that your disk is working OK.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.780]   And if you kids are out there crashing more than a couple
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.020]   of times a month, there's a pretty good chance
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.820]   you've got just tiny bits of disk damage that
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.220]   might be hurting your performance.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.740]   So it'll repair your disks.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:14.380]   It'll quote unquote repair permissions.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.620]   It will clean up all your cache files, which can end up
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.540]   taking up a lot of space, especially if you've gotten low
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:19.180]   on disk space.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.220]   You probably generate some inefficient cache files.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.660]   It'll check all your preference files.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.260]   And it'll remove your swap files.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.820]   So one stop shopping.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.740]   And now the reason I mentioned it, it's not a new app, but--
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.300]   Now with Intel support.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.820]   It's just gotten its first Intel support.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.180]   It is a bleeding edge.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.340]   There's big red letters on the Mac update page
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.180]   warning you to-- this is not for ordinary everyday users.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.380]   But if you're like me and you've been dying on the vine waiting
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.660]   for Applejack to get updated, for me,
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.220]   this is a must-have application.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.580]   Any time I start to have any problems,
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.060]   I do not open disk utility.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.780]   I simply restart and run Applejack.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.220]   And--
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.540]   Well, the advantage is because it's running
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.580]   in single user mode.
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.300]   It has absolute access to everything.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.900]   And I think it's just a better way to run those utilities.
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.660]   So you've had good luck with it.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.460]   It's 1.4.3 RC3.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.420]   And if you go to MacUpdate.com and search on Applejack,
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.260]   it'll turn out--
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.420]   It's a source for its project.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.540]   It's open source, GPL.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.780]   So it's absolutely free.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.300]   And--
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.300]   You've had good luck with it?
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:14.800]   You know what?
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.700]   It's one of those tools that I think
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.620]   it's kind of a must-have troubleshooting tool.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.620]   And anybody who uses a Mac should have it.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.540]   And I haven't used it on the Intel--
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.340]   I mean, I haven't installed, but I haven't used it
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:25.340]   on Intel.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.340]   I haven't had occasion to--
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.180]   It was working on mine.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:29.700]   It's just that I couldn't do the repair disks,
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.340]   or excuse me, the repair permissions.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.980]   And if you know again, who knows how much of this stuff
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.340]   is waving rubber chicken around.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.100]   But if you feel like you've been having some of it,
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.340]   the repair disks thing I swear by.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.980]   I can't tell you how often people are getting--
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.420]   I see people getting beach balls.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.580]   And it turns out it's because they've
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.140]   got a tiny, tiny little bit of usually a catalog problem
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.060]   that needs to get fixed.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.860]   Well, I think repairing your disk or FS check
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.580]   doesn't-- you really need to run it in single user mode.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.380]   That's the way to do it.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.300]   It's the only way to run.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.420]   You can't trigger it.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.500]   It's not easy to trigger.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:02.020]   So I think this is a very simple way to do it.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.300]   Good.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.020]   I agree with you.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.460]   I think Merlin, that's a must-apple jack.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.860]   Did I live up to all the--
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:07.380]   You did.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.780]   He lived up to the hype, my friend, in your face.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.900]   We try every week to stump Merlin man.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.380]   But no, he's good.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.260]   He next week.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.740]   He's real good.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.060]   So when I was in here last week, did you guys come up
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.060]   with a suitable close-up?
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.140]   No, we didn't.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:28.260]   Well, Chris Breen had an excellent one,
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.980]   but we had to bleep it.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.980]   So it was pretty bad.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.340]   By the way, I have one programming note.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.420]   For Mac aficionados, this week in media,
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.860]   which is going to go out about the same time as this show,
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.940]   because I'm just about to compress it here.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.060]   This week in media, it's the longest this week in media
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:49.420]   ever.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.900]   It's like an hour and 55 minutes.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.260]   Now, the real show is only an hour and six minutes.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.260]   So if you go to 106, if you don't care about media,
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.380]   then just listen through all.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.700]   You can just skip to 103, 106, something in that range.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.940]   The rest of it, we got into this kind of--
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.060]   I just didn't turn off the tape.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.340]   And we got in this long discussion about our use of Macs
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:08.660]   and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.860]   But there was a lot of really interesting trivia
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.540]   from Kenji about Old Macs.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:17.700]   And John Foster gets into how the final cut team was formed
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.740]   really in the dobe.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.780]   And in going to Mac or Media and how it got started,
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.100]   which is really fascinating.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.540]   He also talks about the making of the bin there,
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.060]   done that t-shirt, which for those of you
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:32.820]   who are really into Old Mac trivia is an interesting story.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.700]   Anyway, so if you're really into that,
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.900]   you just want to check out the end of that this weekend
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.460]   media that's coming out this week.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.700]   So definitely check that out.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.100]   So, Twim will be out today.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.780]   This show will be out today.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.020]   These are all Tuesday releases.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.580]   And we also have the new Net at Night is coming out tonight.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.460]   So there are going to be three big podcasts at twit.tv.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.060]   Plenty for you to listen to no matter what you're interested.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.060]   What about the tagline?
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.380]   Are we going to do-- is there anything
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.900]   we're going to keep working on?
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.740]   Should we get help from the kids on this, maybe?
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.620]   Yeah, any idea for how we show you now?
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.700]   The only show that has a tagline is
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.540]   another twit is in the can, which is pretty crappy.
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:08.380]   Frankly.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:08.860]   Frankly, I'm excited.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.780]   Yeah, so if you got something for Twit,
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.900]   do we use that?
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.020]   Anything you got?
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.060]   And don't work blue.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:14.860]   Don't work blue.
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:15.860]   We can't use it.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.660]   This is a family-friendly podcast.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.780]   Kind of like Mark Foley, actually.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.620]   By the way--
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.980]   Friendly to the older members of the family, OK?
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.580]   It's just the right age.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.380]   Anybody who has a suggestion for the show,
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.900]   a story that you think we should be covering,
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.300]   we're starting to do this with all the shows now.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.940]   Tag it on Delicious, MBW Ideas.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.980]   One word, MBW Ideas, it'll show up in our list.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.620]   And we'll give you credit and a big thank you
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.420]   for helping us out.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.660]   Make sure you put your whole name in your notes
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.460]   if you put it up there.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.380]   Yeah, that way we can get you.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.500]   Because otherwise we'll just get you--
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.540]   we get kind of a link.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.580]   We get your handle.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.540]   Yeah, we get your delicious handle, which is fine too.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.180]   Thank you very much, Chunky Lover 69.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.180]   You demand.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.860]   I think we found our closeout now, ladies.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.260]   And gentlemen, thank you very much, Chunky Lover 69.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   We'll see you next time on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:13.140]   I'm going to go right now and do a podcast about this show
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.700]   that we just did.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.420]   I might want to interview some of you guys
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.500]   and find out what kind of equipment you're using.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.140]   And then what I'm going to do--
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:20.900]   if I could just finish.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.060]   Then when I'm done with that, I'm
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.260]   going to interview myself about how that show went.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.060]   I'm talking about the equipment that I used.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.380]   And that should be up-- I think that'll
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.500]   be up a little bit later tonight.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.860]   I'm going to start with the third podcast.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.380]   And then do the second one, release that.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.820]   And then eventually what I'll do is a summary show, right?
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.820]   I actually am able to go in and--
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.460]   And then how about a best-o?
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.340]   Yeah, I'll have a best-o.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.620]   Then I'll do-- there'll be some bonus segments where
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.140]   Scott and I will have commentary about the need
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.100]   of doing myself about my--
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:48.940]   It's a new network.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.500]   It's called This Week in Merlin.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.180]   Well, as I said, Leo, the show that I want to do for Twit
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.420]   is called 4P4, a podcast for podcasts
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.700]   or 2P podcasts about podcasting.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.140]   And I feel like there's a lot of interest out there in podcasts
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.340]   and there's a lot of interest in podcasting.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.700]   But there's really-- there's a dearth of information
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:11.620]   for podcasters who do podcasts about podcasts or do podcasting.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.940]   I think we need more.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.940]   We will.
