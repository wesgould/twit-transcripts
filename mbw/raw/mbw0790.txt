[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.880]   I am in for Leo LePorte today, very excited to be joined
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.680]   by the three gentlemen who are here to talk to you
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.320]   all about the Apple news and everything in between
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.040]   and occasionally offer some tech-supported vice popcorn picks
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.680]   and lots of nerdy geeky wonder.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.840]   Up first, it's WGBH's Andy and Otko.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.680]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.520]   Hello, Micah.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.280]   Sorry to start that Leo's not here,
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.480]   but you are an affable and wonderful surprise for us this week.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.800]   Well, I am happy to be here with you all.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.760]   We've also got Alex Lindsey here joining us.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.640]   Of course, Office Hours, 090 Media.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280]   How are you, Alex?
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.720]   I'm doing well, doing quite well.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.200]   Excellent. You're coming in quite clear
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.080]   and you sound great, you look great,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.600]   per usual, you're all a little jealous.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.880]   Well, you know, the funny thing is,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.680]   you know, Office Hours, I'm kind of middle of the road.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.880]   Like, I just try to keep up with everybody else.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.800]   So it's a hard set of Jones just to keep up with.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.120]   I'm trying to imagine what's after,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.640]   is it a hologram that's above you?
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.480]   I can't imagine.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.960]   Yeah, we started this week,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   we started testing streaming Office Hours
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.800]   in high dynamic range.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.320]   So we're streaming at HDR10 to YouTube as a test.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.200]   And we suddenly realized we're going to have to redesign
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.880]   all of our backgrounds because it doesn't,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.520]   it just, some of them look amazing
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.760]   and some of them don't look so good.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.640]   And so we were like, oh, this created a whole new site.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.400]   We set a problem, which is like designing sets for HDR,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.800]   turns out to be harder than we expected.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.480]   So that's why I have more blue color in my background
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.880]   as I was trying to see what was, what would happen there.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.800]   But I'm going to have to think about rethink the whole thing.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.320]   So it's quite a thing.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   But well, you're going to have to redo the whole thing
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.240]   for the metaverse anyway.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.280]   So I mean, yeah, exactly.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   It's time I'm so excited.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.960]   Yeah. You don't want to look like a,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.920]   like a, like a, like a, like a neirdo well or something.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.040]   Not having a metaverse plan.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.880]   I know. I know.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.440]   I don't remember.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.360]   Joining us from the wilds of Canada is Renee Richie,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.400]   youtube.com/Renee Richie.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   Welcome Renee.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   I mean, you've got a background ready for HDR.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.240]   I do. I do.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.920]   And you know what? First, as much as I miss Leo,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.720]   I do love my Micah break weeklies.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   They are, you know, always special, special to me.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.040]   But don't let Alex fool you because he came on my show last week
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.680]   and he made me look pixelated.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.880]   He was all 7K, you know, black magic, raw, boom.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.760]   And then he explained how it worked.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.800]   That's the thing, like he'll come in looking better than you
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760]   and then explain how compression and everything else works
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.880]   to make him better than you.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.520]   It's amazing.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.640]   Fantastic.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.480]   Well, so I actually want to start off this week
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.280]   with a very important update, some follow up.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.480]   A certain person on this show continued over and over and over
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.360]   to tease us about going to the opera, wearing a costume
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.400]   and not revealing too many secrets.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.640]   And so I am curious to hear about Andy and Otko's opera
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   pictures.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.160]   Visit.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   The real book of Boba.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.920]   Yeah, yeah, well, it's on my Instagram if you want to see it.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   I just so I so I attended a performance of of the Metropolitan Opera
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.480]   is Torin Dont has it where with Christine Gurke,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.680]   one of my favorite sopranos dressed in a Boba Fett costume.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   I felt as though the time was right.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.840]   I don't know if I was the first to ever attend the Met Opera
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.280]   as Boba Fett, but I was definitely the most recent.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.720]   And yeah, it was it was something that you I thought of like a
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.880]   bottom month ago when I realized that my tickets for Halloween
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.120]   weekend because I was joking with a couple friends of mine that
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.120]   oh, yeah, I should wear that that like that think geek.com Boba
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.040]   Fett like Blazer that you've seen on my I wore once on the show
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   like last year.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.960]   It's just a green blazer with like a little tiny little
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.160]   Mandalorian crest on it.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.360]   I said, oh, how you as I should wear that to the Met.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.600]   And then I just a month ago, I just thought that actually it's
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.920]   Halloween and I'm going to have to wear a mask anyway because of
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.080]   like the mask and vaccine protocols.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.520]   And I kind of thought how how close how much of a Boba Fett
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.000]   costume could I put together so that I would look so the people
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.400]   who are not very hip would just think, Oh, he's dressed
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   interestingly.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.040]   Whereas anybody who is familiar with the camera would with the
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.320]   character would go.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.920]   Dude, but I think I hit it.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.360]   I made it the only the only non off the shelf clothing item
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.960]   that I that I incorporated was I had to make I had to make the
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.200]   the sunglasses because I felt as though if I were just wearing
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.760]   like red framed glasses that would be a cop out.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.440]   I also made like a mint.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.080]   I figured out how to get the actual armor in there.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.480]   You know, there's a on the breast the breastbone part of the
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.240]   of the armor is like a separate sort of like diamond sort of
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.760]   thing.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.480]   So I bought like a replica of a casting of that painted up and
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   made it like battle scarred and everything and wore it as a
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.920]   pendant.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.080]   Unfortunately, it's like slid off to the side there.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.880]   But yeah, it was it was a lot of fun because for every single
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.320]   every single one of like the biggest like Boba Fett costume
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.280]   elements, I was trying to figure out how can I represent
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.640]   this or quote this or incorporate this without necessarily
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.440]   actually wearing like a blaster jetpack or without actually
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.160]   having to have like forearm blasters.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.640]   So right when I realized that actually I could just I could
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.080]   just like put like leg like warmers of the of the right
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.160]   color on my forearms and that'll work.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.880]   And then if I wear like gray gloves and I if I have a
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.160]   gray blazer, it will kind of look it'll get the effect of
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.440]   Oh, he's Oh, it's an entirely like gray flight suit he's
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.800]   wearing the wearing I'm wearing matching gray slacks underneath
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.160]   that the there's the for the helmet though the helmet was the
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.880]   difficult part because again, I can't walk in wearing a Boba
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.040]   Fett home I could if you there's a there's a really great
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.160]   Instagram account called last night at the Met where there's
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.840]   a photographer who like looks for people who are dressed sort
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.080]   of extra and normally we mean by extra that they're dressing
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.520]   like they're presenting an award like of the 1984 Oscars.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.360]   And you're wearing the dress that share rejected as being a
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.760]   little bit too much, but we're not talking about like science
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.160]   fiction cause play.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.360]   So I realized that there the helmet was the hardest part and
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.960]   I realized that okay, how about if I wear like a kangle cap
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.800]   like a wool cap about the right color and then I've got the
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.360]   glasses and then I even when the running when the running
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.320]   stories in this development was putting together something or
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.480]   selecting something that was too dead on and then realizing I
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.720]   could dial it back a little bit.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.640]   So I did I did buy commercially you can buy, you know, face
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.240]   masks like breathing masks that are have like they're actually
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.560]   printed to look like the lower half of the Boba Fett or Mandalorian
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.320]   helmet and then I decided I had it on I decided that that's
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.240]   too on the nose.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.520]   I look like a dude who decided to buy some stuff and put it on.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.080]   I'll the what what came to what really tied it all together
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.440]   was when I came up with my own like little rule rule book and
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.600]   rule story about it, which is what the look that I'm going
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.440]   after is like imagine that the Boba Fett character has been
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.160]   written but hasn't been like designed yet.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.240]   It's still like early in the production of Empire Strikes
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.120]   Back and the costume designer at Lucasfilm hasn't decided what
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.080]   the look is going to be.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.320]   He has all the notes.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.920]   He goes out to the Metropolitan Opera.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.120]   He sees someone who just went out dressed the way that he
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.960]   wanted to dress and thought, wow, the color palette the elements
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.400]   of that.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.040]   I think that's like 60% of what I want that character to look
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.040]   like. So I took a picture and then he reinterpreted what this
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.520]   person was dressed as what was dressed like as the costume.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   So that that was every single rule that I had the other the
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.640]   other part was that as I was like acquiring like normal clothing
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.280]   like I found the right jacket that I wanted but then it
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.680]   arrived and it fits so beautifully and I liked it.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.160]   I liked it so much that I discarded the idea of yes, I know
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.560]   you spent like $11 on this beautifully embroidered patch of
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   the Fett family crest.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.200]   You intended to sew it like on the sew it into the jacket but
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.760]   it's too nice a jacket.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.360]   Let's just like not have the family crest on there could we?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.640]   So I might revisit this.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:12.120]   There's a last Comic Con of the year is on Saturday for this
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.280]   one or maybe PAX East on March.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.640]   I might continue to develop it and like fix things that I wish
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.360]   I could have fixed if I had more time because I think I'm not
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   the sort of person certainly not the sort of build that can
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.640]   really pull off wearing a excuse me who would feel comfortable
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.240]   wearing Boba Fett armor.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.440]   Whatever your body is, whatever your costume is by all means
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   go for it.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.960]   I wouldn't feel comfortable dressing as Boba Fett but I like
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.920]   the idea of walking around Comic Con thinking someone thinking
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.960]   that oh that person must be a presenter because he's wearing
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.560]   a jacket and tie and then when they get closer that son of a
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.640]   just worrying like a norm core Boba that son of a.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.120]   Well, I'm very very happy I did get my picture took a couple
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   times I did not get thrown out even once so on that basis.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.680]   There you go.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.880]   You succeeded and I think yeah the sort of look you were going
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.680]   for pulled off entirely I've been I was waiting for the
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.280]   Instagram I was happy to see it there.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.440]   All right, let us move on to the Apple news.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.320]   The first thing I wanted to talk about Renee I saw you got a
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:17.160]   chance to check out I believe Apple's new Beats Fit Pro.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:24.600]   These are the kind of beats side of the AirPods headphones and
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.080]   apparently they are perhaps better than the AirPods 3 than
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.440]   the new generation of AirPods.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.320]   What are your thoughts on these Beats Fit Pro?
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   Well first I would show them to you but a mutual acquaintance
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.360]   who I will not name but his name is from me yesterday because
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.120]   they were she said they were pink they were lavender they
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.600]   were purple stone purple or something was the official color
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.920]   and she just took them and left so I can't point them out to
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.440]   you but I did use them for about a week and they are really
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.480]   good they're more analogous to the AirPods Pro because they
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.960]   have active noise cancellation transparency mode they do all
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.120]   of that as well.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.920]   $200 or they're more expensive than AirPods 3 not quite as
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.280]   expensive as the AirPods Pro no inductive charging case so you
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.600]   know they're saving a little bit of money on there but what they
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.680]   have instead of the stems on the side they have a little wing
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.040]   that goes up and secures under the top of your ear as well so
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.600]   they basically have two points of contact and that's where the
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.320]   fit part of the name comes in because they stay in place way
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.400]   better like I famously have Jujitsu mangled ears and everything
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.760]   falls out like the left ear is better the right ear falls out
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   a lot AirPods Pro are okay but those were the best fitting
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.520]   buds I've ever used and they're still light and they still
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.960]   out pretty much every feature the H1 chip so they pair they
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.680]   propagate they do everything AirPods Pro do just without the
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.160]   inductive charging case and 50 bucks cheaper.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.360]   Now are they are they bassy are they sort of the beats sound
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   profile?
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.680]   No you know the beats got sort of toned that down they got
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.280]   amplified several years ago I think when Jimmy Ivine and Dre
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.560]   were escorted out they forgot about Dre basically and they've
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.960]   made much more balance like they still have a different
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.760]   quality than the AirPods they are a little bit the AirPods are
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.000]   really jack-of-all traits like they're meant to sound good no
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.600]   matter what you're doing you know music TV talk everything
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.800]   like that the AirPods are I'd say a little bit more music focused
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.280]   you can talk the microphones are really good but
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.240]   they're a little bit more musical so a little bit more bass a
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.160]   little bit more high-end that kind of thing.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.960]   Gotcha gotcha yeah coming in at $200 and offering
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.800]   most of the same features that the AirPods Pro have is a really
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.400]   good price point there yeah I see the green accent.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.720]   Of course they did I those are the ones I was eyeballing they
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.240]   don't have the stem that sticks down which we had seen some early
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.480]   rumors about Apple's next version of the AirPods Pro
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.360]   one of the things that they were kind of struggling with was
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.320]   having good microphone quality despite the fact that they don't have a stem
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.640]   so it's interesting to hear what you were saying about kind of
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.320]   sound quality for speaking on phone calls with these
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.280]   given that that may be what Apple's experimenting with the next version of
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.680]   AirPods Pro. Yeah and we saw that with the Beats Studio Buds like the Beat
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.640]   Studio Buds are essentially just the tops of the AirPods Pro and I have them
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.160]   actually I have them here. These are really neat because they do
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.440]   they do lack the stem but they have they're impossible to get out because
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.800]   they lack the stem but they really are just these tiny little
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.880]   stemless buds that go right in your ear and the I like to think that the
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.480]   shotgun aspect of the stem really helps the microphone but I did a test in my
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.240]   latest video I did a test with the AirPods 3 AirPods Pro
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.760]   the Beats Studio Buds and the Beats Fit Pro and why are all these names so
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.600]   complicated? I don't know. Exactly. And they all sound roughly analogous so
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.520]   I don't think you lose anything by losing the stem. The stem is just nice because
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.000]   absent the stem you have to do that Beats button thing where you're pushing in
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.680]   your ear like the original AirPods. I find that hell annoying so just
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.040]   squeezing the the stem I find is a much more civilized approach from them.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:00.760]   I much prefer that the force press to the the tap. Now Alex I would like to
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.280]   hear some follow-up actually from all of you gentlemen. These of course have the
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.080]   the spatial audio feature. Have you Alex been listening to
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   spatial audio for music? I'm sure you've been doing it with
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.440]   different shows but I'm curious if you've given the music anymore of a try and
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.120]   kind of what are your thoughts right now with spatial audio particularly given
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.080]   your experience doing video conferencing. Renee had just talked about how there's
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.360]   going to be some spatial audio and FaceTime coming up. Do you think that would be
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.480]   a great experience for for office hours? That already exists in
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.440]   that already exists in blue jeans. Blue jeans has it in video conferencing and they kind of
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.520]   spread you out a little bit and it actually makes it a little easier to understand who's
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.920]   speaking when because it does now the it kind of randomly decides who those people are and where
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:53.720]   they are in the in your kind of spatial area. But if you have a recent Mac book even it'll start
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.200]   it'll sound like they're in different places which is really fascinating. I think that from the
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.160]   music perspective the spatial makes a huge difference for me. I've had the opportunity to listen to a
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.960]   lot of it and and for a couple years before Apple went into that and so I think that once you
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   start getting used to it there's what it does is it gives you more places for those instruments to go.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.120]   Now one thing that Apple's doing beyond just supporting spatial is they're kind of faking
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.000]   spatial. So they're actually doing a bunch of processing to even stereo. So if you have regular
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.720]   stereo they're actually still doing some processing that kind of creates more of a space. So what I
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.840]   have found is that if I'm listening to something on just stereo it really sounds flat now compared
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.640]   to what is coming out of Apple Music because they're kind of really expanding all of it.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:49.560]   Even this regular stereo then when you have the spatial applied to it when they're actually mixed
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.280]   for spatial it just to me it sounds a lot more full and it sounds like the instruments are a
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.840]   lot further apart. So my mind can kind of hear them. They can hear the symbols better and they can
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.160]   hear this little and you know some other little triangle or something else that's been placed
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.080]   somewhere else that I couldn't hear before. It was just kind of part of what was mixed into
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.200]   right or left and now there's just a lot more places to put it. And so I think that you know we've
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.000]   been starting to play a lot with Logic's new you know Apple released of course Logic's Logic with
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.160]   a spatial audio and we're starting to play with it a lot and it's pretty amazing.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.840]   It doesn't work by the way as a note if you have an M1 Mac Mini your AirPod Pros and your AirPod
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:42.760]   Macs is we'll just hear mono. So it works perfectly in my it went completely the other way because I
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.320]   was super excited and I opened up Logic and I started playing with Logic and I started moving
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.520]   trying to move things around. I was like wow I want this to work but it doesn't really sound
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.560]   like it's working. Maybe you know like I was worried about that. Yeah but it was like I was like
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.360]   because they can't tell wait they don't know where the screen is the same problem they had with
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.720]   the Apple TV it for a since they didn't like you could have it in a closet you could have it in
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.640]   front of the TV you could have it across the room so they couldn't count on the position of the box
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.240]   to determine where the spatial audio should be. So what they started doing with the Apple TV and
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.680]   I think they're going to do with the Mac Mini is they start to see which way you're staring most of
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.800]   the time and then they assume that what you're looking at is the display and then they make the
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.520]   the FaceTime does this really well FaceTime group calls now and they just assume that's the
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.760]   display that's that's the center for your spatial audio. And you put regular headphones in it works
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.160]   great. So it's just it's just a view but if you have the ones that are in their position and I
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.200]   have to admit that I have learned I do a lot of testing because a lot of my work is in atmos
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:44.120]   and and so so I test streams all the time and I'm looking at stuff in in spatial and the thing that
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.520]   took me a long time to get used to is I'd be I have my AirPods on testing them and I'd be looking at
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.800]   my iPad and I'd turn away and then I think oh no there's something wrong with the left channel
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.360]   and then I'd look back now it's fine oh no it's broken it's fine it's broken you know and so the
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.840]   first couple weeks your brain is disconvobulated by that process but anyway it's I think it's going
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:08.120]   to be I think it's going to continue to be a big deal. I had that same experience. Oh good Andy.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.360]   Yeah no no I think I think you and I were about the same about the same about the exact same thing.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.840]   That's the thing that really just screws with me when it comes to spatial audio that there are
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.520]   times where I really I don't necessarily want to be having experience where you Andy you have an
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.720]   AM radio that's located here inside your office and here's where all the sound is coming from.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.560]   I like the idea that when I'm wearing headphones no the sound is relative to wherever I happen
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.440]   wherever my head is so that's the thing that kind of I like the idea of sitting and comfortably in
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:46.760]   a chair and hearing a more dynamic of audio field with spatial audio I don't like the idea that
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.320]   I kind of feel as though I have to turn my head to say but to feel as though I'm listening and
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:57.000]   focusing on this one person. The other thing actually before I let you continue the other thing is that
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.760]   like I have a hearing loss in this year and much stronger hearing in that ear that's a problem if
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.360]   I turn this way I'm used to in conversations sitting so that my good ear is facing the conversation
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.840]   it would be a problem for me now I have to like sit at my desk like this because that's kind of the
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.080]   only way to make sure that I have to make sure that I stay focused in the sound field so yeah it's
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:25.800]   I agree with you I really love spatial and I've grown to not really like the inertial part of it
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.160]   you know so it doesn't need to be you don't need the inertia to have spatial you know it could just
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   be spatial whichever way you're looking and you know like if I'm in if in my my house my living
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.480]   room is seven one and you know I don't want to know where I turn my head it's still coming from
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:47.800]   where it's coming from so it's so I think that it's anyway so I think that I think I'd rather leave
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:54.360]   it in spatial and not have the inertia inertia than than than with it because it I find it more
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.840]   is more problematic than than than useful most of the time yeah I agree it's it's one of those
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.120]   things that I turn off the head tracking part of it and just leave on the spatial audio part of it
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.480]   and that's what I've come to do it took me long I kept on thinking I was going to get used to it
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.920]   and then I just never did turn it off.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:17.880]   Folks we've got a lot of the effort love your energy but no thank you.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:23.240]   Yes there you go it was a cool feature at first it was fun to try it out but we're we're gonna let
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:29.480]   it go. The spatial though is amazing yeah yeah the actual spatial even just adding reverb I that's
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.400]   what I've been playing with just just adding reverb to a regular track it just feels bigger because it's
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.760]   now feels like it's coming from around you so it really takes very little to really feel it expand.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:48.440]   All right we're going to take a quick break before we talk about even more this is of course

[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.600]   Break Weekly we're back from the break and we got a lot to talk about but I want to talk first of
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.960]   all this is a quick mention uh Apple announced that the HomePod was going to be coming out in
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.400]   some new colors Renee did you get review units of the new colors do they are they tuned differently
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.760]   depending on what color you get no this doesn't sound more orange it just looks more orange and
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.200]   it was perfect for Halloween and bar goes as well it just and also for your branding yeah
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.800]   yeah I think you know that's well which I should hold it on this side though so it looks it's more
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:42.440]   contrasty that's what the kids say I think I keep I keep wanting to light it it looks like a
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:47.880]   decorative candle yes well I think the smell wouldn't be as good as the incense that you might
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.280]   get off something from Beth Beth Beth and beyond but excellent point they're just there the only
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.040]   issue is that it's really weird because like those we're just talking about the beats um
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.640]   the beats fit pro those those have purple and green options where these have orange and yellow
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.240]   and blue options and I feel like did they split the colors up could they not just do all colors
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.560]   for all things that they make them choose it's so odd to me I want purple and I know you want green
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.520]   I do I want great if they would have done because the whole time I'm saying look the HomePod I
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.360]   just wanted to fade into the background so the black and the white makes sense of space gray and
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.160]   white makes sense but if they came out with a green one my silly self would definitely buy a
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.760]   green one um but I do wonder sort of I was talking I can remember I was just the other day I was
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:35.640]   talking kind of it's not that I need it to be logical or that I need it to make sense but I
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:43.320]   wish I could just clandestinely join uh Apple's marketing team so that I could hear the internal
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.880]   reasoning behind their different color choices and as soon as I heard the answer I'd be like okay
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.120]   two weeks gotta see you later I just want to know I guess it doesn't have to make sense but like
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.600]   well this is like watches this year in odd colors there's no just sort of standard normal
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.080]   color with the watch this year and and so yeah go ahead you were talking about skews no there's
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.600]   two issues those are actually two separate issues one is they always try to predict what the
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   hot colors are going to be some year they end up picking what ends up being like Pantones color
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.040]   of the year they have like I forget her name I'm totally blanking on her name but they have
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.240]   one of the uh industrial design department um members she just focuses on color and
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.160]   yes famously a word Johnny said no no no that looks like frat house competing we're not gonna
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.560]   go with that orange you know so like they have those those really pretentious discussions
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.960]   but they just come up with all the colors and then marketing decides how much demand there is
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.480]   and you for some products they know there's gonna be a ton of demand so they can make every single
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.520]   color and then they balance how many of each they produce because you know usually silver or
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.920]   white and black or space gray are by far the most popular colors everything else they have to sort
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.280]   of demand forecast and then they try to see if like two colors sell we'll try five and a five
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.520]   sell maybe we'll try all of them or maybe one will be a spring color like there'll be a purple
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.920]   home pod like there was a purple iphone last spring so they try to it's a whole bunch of different
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   marketing levers that they can prove they can pull to make sure they don't have like a color
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.320]   nobody buys but also have like a color winner product is not getting another update and suddenly
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.520]   it looks fresh because they painted it yeah you know it's kind of it's kind of odd that a lot
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.840]   of companies haven't really decided to have a colorway that is just simply primed metal or
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.560]   primed surface when you buy when you go shopping for like built-in speakers or patio speakers
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:29.080]   oftentimes even like major manufacturers they will sell an option that is simply you get your
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.480]   black you get your gray get your whatever worry we will sell you an unprimed speaker grill and
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.200]   your decorator or yourself can paint it whatever color is going to match your gay core so wouldn't
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.360]   be interesting if they will if there were a way that they could sell a housing or even if it was
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.000]   a clip on the simply says here is it will accept whatever cryo on paint whatever home depot depo
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.520]   spray paint you want because it is kind of insulting say we we won't we won't sell this in this frat
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.800]   house color well maybe maybe i like frat house colors i have no taste but it's my house so i'm
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.360]   sorry johnny let's not be paid to redegregate you can exactly you can you can pay any
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.920]   cigarette left to beer and beer cap uh became a place yeah Alex i think we're going to we're both
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.200]   going to take the the fabric covering off of our home pod minis and uh diet you can make anything
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.360]   you want you can you know we we just finished we just finished dying or i don't know we haven't you
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:22.120]   know we have we can die anything right my uh roblox got turned off and my my uh daughter
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:28.920]   started pain rocks i was you know i thought about really good at it yeah i thought about your
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.000]   daughter whenever the roblox because you mentioned that she's like an interior decorator on the game
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.960]   and i saw that was down for a while and i thought oh no Alex so i was wondering what do you do when
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:44.600]   roblox is down apparently you paint rocks she painted uh like 12 rocks and really was so well done
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.320]   that i have to admit like with my kids if they if they show any interest or capacity to something
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.800]   i just go what can i get you you know like like how can we how can we fuel this you know and um and
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:29:01.000]   so i i bought like i think two collections like thick and thin of these acrylic pens and a magnifying
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.560]   glass with the light in it everything else she's all set up now so so i i said talk to your aunt
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.960]   your aunt your aunt makes a living on edc so you talk to your aunt here's your stuff and then i
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.520]   just get out of the way so so it's hopefully she'll be able to pay for a college you know that's
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:21.960]   the big plan well i guess we're going to start up uh the spoke home pod mini uh decorating edc i
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.800]   think i think i can handle one and have her once she gets a little into this maybe i'll just give her
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.120]   one of the one of my little home pods minis and have her paint it and then we'll show it on mac
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:37.560]   break uh let her let her please not be cool like cusanky eggs yeah i do wonder about the acoustic
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.120]   transparency of acrylic paint though we might have a problem there what were you saying Andy
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:48.760]   i know that that sounds like a really interesting like etsy shop where i i will i will send you
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.560]   something and please put your wonderful little style on it i i don't i don't know if i i
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.600]   true shoes are a big deal there's there's a whole shoe thing where they people paint their shoes
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.640]   or paint other people shoes when they get sued by Nike where's that that's only if you include human
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.320]   blood in the shoe that's the only i wasn't gonna go there mike i'm sorry but thank you for bringing
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:13.960]   that home big no big no yeah sorry but uh i am a trampiracy they trying to control our freedoms
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:21.240]   it's just not right it's just not right uh okay let's move on we've got still so much to cover
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.400]   uh but one of the things before because of course apple earnings will be coming up we'll be talking
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.520]   about that shortly um but i did want to talk rene i think you're a good person to talk to anytime
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:37.160]   these uh these these issues come up because one it's interesting to hear if you have experienced
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.480]   them what you can do with them but also kind of what you've heard and who you've talked to about it
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:49.400]   on nine to five mac they reported this issue uh about apps having this application memory error
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:56.120]   the thing pops up and it says your system is run out of application memory and then it shows you
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.800]   a bunch of different apps and it says quit any applications you aren't using now one of the
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:08.040]   interesting things about this is first of all in it uh the application memory is kind of high
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:15.880]   mail was taken 56.4 gigs of memory and then final cut pro which i'm less surprised about uh was
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:23.400]   taking 24.2 gigs of memory uh now interestingly at first it seemed like it was an apple silicon
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:29.560]   thing but later on as more people were starting to talk about it it seemed to be that intel and uh
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:35.560]   and apple silicon macs were both experiencing this issue i'm curious had had you seen this thing
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.360]   popping up on your own devices did you see it kind of out in the wild and what do we know about what's
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.960]   going on here yeah so i haven't seen it um but i have seen people who have seen it so i have second
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.840]   hand seen it uh you know mail is one it's it's just it's basically like a memory leak like there's
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.680]   there's some error that's causing the memory just grow and grow and grow and grow i've seen it with
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.400]   adobe which is probably not a big surprise adobe after effects is trying to go m1 they have a beta
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.040]   but they're also in rosetta and i've seen astronomical amounts of memory being consumed and these are
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.960]   people with like 64 gigabyte m1 mac system so it's not a lightweight by any stretch of the imagination
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:16.200]   and because it's on intel it maybe it's like a really weird um monoray bug that's causing it
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.840]   or some interaction between those apps or is the way that monoray is handling memory in general
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.680]   there was another one this weekend i don't want to get off a side tangent but it does relate
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.720]   where you know a bunch of people in canada woke up an hour uh late for for school for work
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.440]   because their their iPhones and their android phones were suddenly on the wrong time and
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.640]   you know that's famous famous ios has had this problem famously since 2012 and android
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.880]   occasionally as well but this was an apple this was like bell had done it and it turns out there's
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.240]   like three different ways your phone checks for time and some of them fail over and you know like
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.040]   there's just there's a complexity of modern software where it's not everyone has a problem it's the
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.000]   unique interaction on your circumstances that cause these problems so mail is fine for me i don't
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.920]   use after effects myl cut is fine for me but there are definitely people experiencing this
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.880]   some i'm anticipating a monoray patch i thought it was something that i was doing to be honest
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.680]   like i just like well i must be not glibing enough hard drive space because i've run out i've had
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.960]   a couple memory errors in the last uh probably three or four in the last three weeks and i'm just
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.920]   like i don't know i've never had this before and suddenly it's all a thing so so evidently it is a
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:28.440]   thing so i i've definitely experienced it that's interesting see that's that tends to be where i
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.680]   go with it to alex is like what did i do wrong it's my fault yeah like i must be doing something i
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.840]   don't usually assume that the operating system is having a problem managing memory so i usually
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.640]   assume that i've done and i've got so many experimental things on my on like especially my mac minis that
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.960]   have that have moderated they're not my work they're not my day-to-day work machines and so i'm
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.840]   constantly like the newest of everything and beta is of all kinds of stuff and yeah and so i just
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.120]   if it breaks i'm like oh that must be i must be doing something wrong i usually say oh it's beta it's
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.560]   the beta i'm running i'm running some beta somewhere it's because of the issue
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:05.800]   um yes it's a it's a sense of it's it's offensive because we because like you know we're we're
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.480]   dealing with a situation where nesley wants to own all the water now we've got corporations owning the
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:16.760]   owning time we don't get to have our own sense of time yeah we're all gonna have to set up our own
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.120]   nuclear or at a time o'clock i mean i think i think i think i think there's some somewhere in this
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:27.240]   conversation is a discussion about the totalitarianism of daylight savings like this whole shifting
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.360]   our schedule around you know like any any i just i'm just waiting for somebody to run on just that
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.240]   platform like i'm not gonna tell you anything else i'm gonna do i'm just gonna get rid of daylight
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.680]   savings i vote for that person i mean i just lost the vote i you got my vote yeah or or at least all
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.480]   i all i want is to come up with a descriptive name that actually gives me a sense of daylight savings
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:50.440]   well am i saving it at the beginning of the day am i saving it at the end of the day because i
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.960]   i know i always every single time that an app or i'm setting up a device or a new watch
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.920]   and asking always daylight savings time on or off i have to google it just to know is daylight savings
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.040]   time on or off i know i know i spring forward fall back but i don't know what it means right which
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.200]   ones which exactly i just say p t like other people send me pst and i'm like i remember one time i
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.600]   said pst and someone said pd t and i was like p t and that was it i never used them again that's
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.840]   exactly i just refuse to put yep exactly i'm not gonna guess
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.440]   yeah i found the new street was the province of elberta the power province of elberta voted yes
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.320]   to floride no to removing daylight savings time and their split on equalization payments what
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:44.760]   is happening to this world oh my goodness uh well uh one of us as well hopefully correct the
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:51.960]   daylight saving time issue anyway um let's move on this is an interesting uh story that had me kind
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:58.440]   of thinking about the way that i've had to do uh returns or replacements or repairs with apple in
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:06.040]   the past um reportedly apple is going to start offering the iphone 10r as a loner device if you
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.000]   have a lengthier repair time so if you bring in your phone and you have a repair time that might
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.720]   take some watt may might take a while apple may start to offer you an iphone 10r to kind of
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.600]   carry around with you until it comes time for you to be able to get your actual phone back and
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.360]   this made me think of uh the time when my macbook pros battery started bloating and i had to take
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.840]   it in to get uh you know replaced or whatever they did they did a bunch of stuff to it um and
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.760]   of course i had my work computer but i thought man if i didn't have my work machine it would really
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.120]   be complicated to get any work done or if you don't have a you know a company that you work for that
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:55.160]   also provides a machine then you would have that issue so uh the 10r is kind of a in-between
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:01.960]   loner is not a bad idea uh but i'm curious if you folks have done repair replacements before and
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.320]   what your experience has been with getting or not getting a loner and uh you imagine that we're
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.080]   like iphone se person who's like getting the iphone 10r and they're like i don't there's no home
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.520]   button i don't know i've been avoiding that for three years and you're doing this to me now and
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.720]   then the person who's on an iphone like like 13 pro macs i mean what is this what is like this
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.840]   just nobody's going to be happening like yeah it's really it's really going to be a test of faith
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:31.480]   and apple however because when you consider uh not even beyond the amount of personal data that is
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.160]   synced to your phone when you need to use it day to day but now i'm like okay i know i've read
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:43.800]   every single technical paper about the secure enclave but now i'm about to enroll in like an
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.640]   unlocking mechanisms biometric unlocking mechanisms with this i am now about to enroll and tap to pay
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.920]   on this device that i'm going to be sending back that i'm only using for like a week i hope
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:02.680]   it's uh it's there's it's like there's a difference between trusting in a technology that a technology
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   works in the abstract and say no even better like you know that uh that physics demonstration uh
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.800]   where you where a demonstrator dunks their hand in the middle of like molten metal but because
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.400]   they coated their their hand with water they it flat there's a there's a there's an effect where
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.800]   it flashes to steam so quickly that it provides an insulating layer it's like wow what an
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.680]   interesting phenomenon and then when someone's oh well actually we have a pot of molten lead right
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:36.360]   here why don't we spray up your hand and you can demonstrate it it's like oh maybe not you know i
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.440]   i i realized i was thinking about this question i realized i've never taken my computer in for
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:46.280]   anybody to ever repair in the history of computers for me you know and i and i think it has to do with
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.600]   because of some of the some of the stuff i've done in the past i i i don't
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.760]   the idea of having my hardware out of my control is a problem for me and so so like for instance i
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.960]   i work with some companies that uh i we've worked with some companies that if you not me but their
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.760]   employees will unload everything that there are overseas they'll unload everything and because
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.560]   if if customs ask for their computer they just give it to customs and they walk away like literally
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.280]   like this is yours you know like you can't they don't want it back you know and so so when they do
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.840]   that um i it makes me you know it gives me pause and um and so if i have a computer that breaks i
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.680]   have to admit that i try to get it to work or i unload stuff off of it but i've never actually
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.360]   taken it in because i don't think i could use it again like i would worry about it all the time
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.040]   you know and so so it's the same thing with my phones as i've broken a couple phones but then
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.600]   that's just the end of that phone you know i guess i don't take it in because i'm again i have a i
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:47.080]   have a huge i didn't think about it in the consciousness until right now but um that i just don't feel
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.320]   comfortable having someone else have my hardware and then get it back and keep doing what i'm doing
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:59.480]   yeah interesting now i i so i have taken a mac break a mac break as i said a mac book and in before
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:05.800]   to have it serviced by apple you know took it to the apple store and uh they sent it away and
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.520]   replaced the battery and i think because of whatever year it was they also had to replace the keyboard
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.960]   and all that stuff um and got it back and everything was fine but i before i took it in i completely
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:21.560]   wiped it it was just a fresh mac book pro uh because yeah there was no way i was going to send
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.920]   it off with my stuff on there and i think at minimum minimum you want to do that you know and
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.560]   and it's actually the funny thing is is i i still buy computers thinking i might take them in someday
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.000]   um you know because i buy them with very small hard drives mostly so that it's just system
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.800]   information on it and then all of everything else is on some external drive that i could just
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.160]   unplug and then just give you the hardware so i i do it in that plan i just never take it in but the
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.520]   i think it also speaks to some of apple's reliability that i don't need to you know like i haven't
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.240]   i've had very few that just break on their own usually i did something to them to kill them um and
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.160]   but i think that um uh you should definitely not take a computer into any repair store
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.440]   with things on it you know like that's you know things that matter uh that that would that would
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:12.200]   be a bad idea absolutely Andy you were gonna say something but uh but yeah this is a great
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.160]   policy though that for people who want to have access to that sort of thing it's it's always
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.000]   advisable to keep your old phone just in case but a lot of people especially with iPhones how
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.240]   durable they are they they've already passed them down to another person in the family but
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.880]   but you're kind of you're kind of screwed if you have absolutely nothing to nothing to to
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.760]   transact with and you can't afford to borrow a replacement for somebody and one of the things
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:41.160]   for me is that you know i have i have a uh i put i have a protective cover you know face plate and
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:46.440]   then i have this thing that's kind of a wallet that is also a protective case and i do this
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.120]   immediately like within a day of having the phone like i had this one for like two days and i i
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.400]   was like i can't take it out of the house because it hasn't been it hasn't been put in a case yet
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.280]   and so um so once it goes into the case you know it's it when it when you pull it out it's in mint
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.440]   condition the whole time so i don't and i did that because i bought one i bought one a couple
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.920]   years ago maybe five or six years ago and immediately dropped it like two days
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.640]   and then it didn't break it here's the worst part is it didn't break it enough to replace it it
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.440]   just had a little chip in the upper corner and i just and you're just like oh like i can't believe
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.800]   that you know like every time every time you look at it you're just like chip in the corner
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.560]   really you know and so chip in the corner again we are brothers from another mother my pixel six
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:35.800]   pro arrived two hours ago the very even before i i i i put in the swim before i i turned it on for
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.920]   the first time i put it into this new case that has been sitting around for about a week because i'm
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.000]   i'm like you i've never i've never dropped a phone and broke it almost immediately but i would be
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.160]   so upset with myself i i have dropped a camera like the very first time i took it out uh i had it i
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.600]   was using it above a concrete surface and it didn't and just like you said it didn't break it enough
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:01.560]   to like actually break it but it broke enough so that for the past five years every time i swap out
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.640]   a battery or a memory card i have to unpeel the little piece of gaffer's tape that's keeping the
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:12.200]   battery covered close and reminded how incompetent i was like with us eight eight day old six hundred
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.000]   dollar camera yes we had we had somebody in our office they dropped a sixteen thousand dollar
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.120]   lens taking it out of the box oh no it was like it was like it was like it was this this cabrio lens
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.840]   and they took it out they dropped it and and i just looked at it i was like well that's what's
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:32.680]   insurance is what what what monastery are they living at right now what what denominations
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.960]   they said excited we like to call it i'm on a stereo but there's bars and animals and
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:46.360]   he does spend time it he does he does live in what's called a cell alone most of the time living a very
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.320]   simple yard he goes out to the yard but he stays he stays in the corner because the lions are in the
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.600]   yard and you know it's this alex is painting is never and every time every day he's every
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.040]   day he says to himself but you know what that's fair
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:06.600]   yeah exactly yeah you drop that yeah exactly you drop that lens you're like you know what i belong
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.720]   here my bad yeah exactly we got to take another quick break but we'll come back with more including
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:19.080]   uh conversation about apple's earnings report uh and lots more to come this episode of mac break

[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.920]   userway for sponsoring this week's episode of mac break weekly uh before we headed to the break
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:19.400]   we were talking about sending your device in for repair uh or replacement and one of the things that
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:29.480]   uh just happened is i fix it recently tore down the new macbook prose and in doing so have determined
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:36.440]   that the latest version of apple's macbook is a little more repairable uh than previous versions
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:42.200]   in fact it's a little bit easier to replace some of the internal components then they have made
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.680]   it before and i thought it would be a good time to chat a little bit about that you know Alex you
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.560]   were talking about how when your machine goes down you don't tend to take it in have you ever
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:57.640]   upgraded your device on your own repair your device on your own or do you just kind of go okay
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   this one's done time to get a new one i did that a lot with um my i had a lot of mac mac
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:08.280]   a mac prose you know the old cheese graders i had a lot of those and obviously we were constantly in
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.160]   there you know putting cards in taking cards out doing other things uh with them so i think that
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:18.760]   that was something that we we tinkered a lot more i did attempt to fix uh or to upgrade some ram
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:24.280]   and my laptop once and i i don't do that anymore uh you know that was you know i got another computer
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:29.960]   like it was it was i destroyed it so um so i i think i probably didn't have the right tools from i fix
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.440]   it is probably it i i do think that uh although i you know i did notice that they they also
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.480]   reviewed the repairability of the of the apple polishing cloth and it became very bad
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:44.600]   it was it did not it's not fairly nearly as well as the macbook pro it turns out when you take it
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.640]   apart you can't there's no way to put back together yeah and no user replaceable battery in it for
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:57.080]   some reason i just thought wow the most involved you know i i it's i'm i'm here also every time there's
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.320]   a device without a headphone jack to complain bitterly about it as though my mother just got
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:07.720]   just got into a traffic accident so yeah no headphone jack what's up the most involved repair i did was
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:14.680]   of a battery uh for one of the macbook pros of yesteryear i got the i fix it kit this was for a friend
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:19.880]   they needed a new battery and so i said okay yeah i'll do that for you so i got the i fix it kit with
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:24.680]   the bat well they bought it and uh had it sent to me i fix it kit with the battery and all the stuff
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:31.720]   you needed part of it was adhesive remover so you had to put on these uh you know i think it was
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:38.520]   what night trial gloves or whatever and take this squeeze bottle and squeeze this this adhesive
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:44.680]   remover all over the battery and then slowly but carefully remove it after you took apart pretty
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:50.200]   much the entire machine and then built it back afterward after you installed the new battery
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.040]   it was a really involved process but what was kind of nice is that while i was taking it all
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:58.760]   apart then you could clean out the inside even better than you know you normally would so
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:04.440]   able to get all of the dust out of the uh the fans and it was like a brand new machine afterward
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.720]   with that brand new battery in it um Renee do you do repairs of your device or have you done any kind
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.280]   of repair replacement stuff with your device i know that these days it is hard like uh Alex was
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:19.320]   saying it used to be there was a little bit easier more to do more you could replace no um i mean
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.800]   for two main reasons i used to when i had when i built my own pc's and i'd make my own tower pc's
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.240]   and i'd swap out cars and things like that but you know like my father can
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:33.800]   not today but like back back in the day he would rebuild cars and he would um you know he built
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.640]   homes you know like he was just incredibly handy he would build whatever we needed and then it got
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.880]   to a point where like he opened a hood and looked at a tessel and went i have no idea what this is
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.600]   anymore um and i was like that way before i don't have his technical acumen i don't have his his
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.360]   talent when it comes to understanding physical things and repairing and replacing them
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:56.040]   so that is something i am perfectly perfectly content to outsource to a manufacturer or a
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.360]   you know a qualified service representative i would rather they do it well than i do it poorly
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:06.200]   just at a point of pride or uh or speediness they do make good stunt stunt laptops once you've
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.840]   broken one i broke the screen on one of them at a titanium and i used to use it in the before
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:15.080]   in times when i used to go to actual conferences it was really fun to be up and you want to wake
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.920]   everybody up you just walk up to the front of the room and accidentally drop your laptop but drop
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.440]   it like with in epic proportions like trip and let it go and let it like fly dinner and the whole
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.680]   crowd just goes oh and then and then and then you pull out another one you go that's why you have a
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:35.800]   that's why we have backups and then it wakes everybody up you know you get at least 15 minutes out of
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:43.160]   that you know of adrenaline exactly yeah not bad not bad um yeah so i'm glad that these ones are
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:48.360]   seem to be more user-appable user-applatable for the folks who want to do that i tend to like to do
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:53.960]   that not it's not out of pride or anything like that it's just out of curiosity uh certainly when i
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.040]   was a kid i would take things apart and then of course the classic is that you don't put them back
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:03.560]   together and uh if it was something that didn't belong to me i did put it back together something
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:08.520]   that belonged to me sometimes i wouldn't put it back together but you had three screws left where
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.240]   did those three screws go from where do they yeah what were these four it's it's one thing it's one
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.840]   thing when a key it does it and you know that they just put a couple extra screws in there it's another
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.080]   thing when you took the thing apart and then you put it back together and all those pieces were
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.480]   there before and now they're not and now you know you're like you're you're something wrong yeah
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:32.680]   i've always been in the habit oh go ahead go ahead Andy no that uh before we move on that that it really
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.200]   is most significant that they've made the battery so much easier and simpler to replace because these
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:43.400]   are we're not just talking about repairs now even though that is significant that is as
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.800]   a lot of us have been saying replacing a battery is one of the most transformative
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:53.960]   things you can do to an old rechargeable device but also we're confronting a lot of issues in the
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:01.560]   communities where things just get tossed out and you have these lithium let's not call them bombs
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.520]   but things that can start runaway fires and if you've got them in a pile of recycling
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.560]   recycling stuff in your community that here is a whole bunch of lithium-powered things in a pile
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:17.080]   once one of them goes off because let's say there was a there was a there was a a flood or something
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.240]   in that basement or whatever once one of them goes off you've got a huge problem that involves
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:27.560]   like you know toxic fumes and stuff so the ability to at least for at least whoever it is at a very
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:33.240]   very safety conscious recycling center if they can easily pop off the bottom immediately just pull
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.040]   a couple of tabs to release batteries without having to god forbid subject them to heat to
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.480]   release an adhesive and get rid of or recycle all the other parts but put the the battery in a place
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:49.480]   where it can't do that much damage to the property to other people that's a huge huge thing forward so
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.040]   that is of all the things that are that are important about right to repair or about repair
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:55:00.920]   ability or about these iFixit scores the ability for just a barely trained person to safely get out
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:06.040]   a lithium battery and recycle that separately and safely that for me is a huge huge step forward
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:13.000]   i'm glad to see evidence of this in the new macbooks yes i agree i agree um the one last thing
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.120]   i was going to say is i have a habit of anytime i get a smart home product uh i typically take it
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:26.920]   apart just to see what all is inside and uh that behavior was reinforced one time when i got this
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:35.480]   product and i took it apart and hidden behind the frame was a microphone that wasn't mentioned
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:41.720]   anywhere yeah in the features of the device rene you probably remember me talking to you about this
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:47.880]   and uh so i thought um what is going on here and ended up reaching out to the company and they
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:52.440]   were talking about how in the future they would think about adding you know feature with a microphone
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:59.000]   etc but i just took it and unplugged it from the the main board and took the microphone out and put
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.600]   the thing back together uh but after that like now every time i don't care what company it comes
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:09.080]   from if it's a smart home device i always will take it apart just to see what's inside and put it back
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:15.880]   together so i i love having my kit of screws that aren't you know the standard ones but uh it's nice
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:22.040]   that this stuff is as repairable as it is and i know the i was called the free phone um
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.280]   or something like that uh that lets you it comes with fair phone i think screws and fair phone
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.440]   fair phone thank you the free phone is probably some creepy uh uh
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   straight wing right free of phone yeah exactly yes um rene you sound like you were about to say
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.760]   something no no oh okay i was i remember this when we went when you first discovered this i remember
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:48.280]   we were trying to figure out what was going on there yeah that was pretty wild stuff all right let's
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:55.080]   move on i wanted to talk about the app store um this is an ongoing conversation uh the
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:03.960]   the idea of making money in the app store and the way that people see and value apps and services
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:12.280]   uh notability is a really popular app for ios iPadOS and in some cases MacOS that
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:17.560]   lets you take notes and loads of different ways and you can use it to record things you can use
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:22.920]   it to sketch you can use it to add photos it's an it's an incredible app one of the top rated apps
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.600]   that on ios today uh rosemary orchard and i end up talking about uh rather often depending on
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:35.080]   which episode we are covering and notability just recently announced that it was going freemium
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:43.000]   meaning that it is available to download for free with many of the uh built-in features and then
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.640]   you pay a subscription to use the more involved features the there the you know the deeper features
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:58.680]   and with that came a whole host of people very upset about notability going uh freemium and
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:07.560]   even going as far as trying to uh submit to the app store complaints about the because apple
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:15.000]   recently added a like a option to report scam apps again they added that back and people
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.840]   reporting the app saying that it was violating the app store guidelines i wanted to talk to all of
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:27.320]   you about the history of the app store the cost of apps in the app store and you know all of us i
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:33.240]   think at the very least have colleagues and friends who are app developers and in many cases have
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:37.160]   developed apps ourselves that have been published in the app store and have worked in app development
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:47.320]   in some way it's kind of wild for me when i am speaking with uh with folks folks i know outside
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.040]   that aren't steeped in tech and talking to them about apps and i say oh yeah this is the perfect app
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:57.240]   for this specific thing that you're asking for and then they say okay cool i send them the link it's
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.920]   a dollar ninety nine in the app store and suddenly they don't want it and you try to explain to them
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.480]   you know that is actually a very very good price for this app so i'm just curious about your
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:14.120]   experiences and it sounds like uh you'd like to kick things off sure just that's the you're
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:20.840]   rarely talking about huge companies that are trying to figure out that i i'm tired of having to buy
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.760]   the or buying the the synthetic yacht wax i want to buy the yacht wax that's made from endangered
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:31.880]   species bones because it just upsets me you're really you're talking about small small shops as
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:37.240]   professional as these apps look as professional as the website is as professional as the fact that
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:42.920]   you can email tech support and get a real human responding in less than an hour hour and a half
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:49.240]   oftentimes you are talking about a one person shop or a two or three or four people who hire a
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   good designer who who hire people to put on that really really great face and it is so so hard to
[00:59:55.240 --> 01:00:00.440]   make money off the app store every single time that we talk about the the revenues that keep
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.760]   increasing increasing increasing in the app store every time that apple very very proudly tells
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:09.080]   developers how many billions of dollars they've paid out and how many people they've hired we have
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.720]   to remember that we're not talking about these two or three four four person shops that are doing
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:19.320]   to do list managers most of that money narrowly all of that money is going to in app purchases in
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.960]   games and there's a very very small sliver of people who use the app store who are actually paying
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:29.480]   that money so they need to find ways to make sure that they can sustain this product and so
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:35.080]   it's it it I think that the you know money is money is valuable that's why they call it money
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.680]   and so every time that the the payment model or of a favorite app changes that you've gone from
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.160]   well I paid twenty dollars for it or five dollars for it three years ago and now I own it I never
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.800]   have to buy anything ever again once they start saying that by the way we're not giving any more
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:56.200]   updates to this it's now going to cost you 80 cents a month to give give us 12 give us 10 bucks
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:02.280]   a give us 10 bucks a year for continued access to it you have 10 bucks is 10 bucks think about it but
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:08.440]   realize that that is what's happening to continue to make your your favorite app get better and better
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.840]   and better every single time that I've switched that a favorite app of mine has switched to this
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:19.320]   model I to have grumbled I've never considered review bombing the site because I won't say that
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:24.360]   I won't I'm not a monster I'm just not that kind of monster absolutely but to but at some point you
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.640]   realize that the the benefit of this is that instead of this becoming an abandoned product in two years
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:35.160]   time instead of at some point I buy a brand new iPhone and now this product won't work on it because
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.960]   it's not compatible with all this all this new hardware not only will continue to be compatible
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.360]   but they can continue to put better and better features in it and furthermore I'm helping this
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:50.440]   person to get paid for the work that they're doing that I appreciate so yeah we we the more you
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.920]   understand about where the money goes in the app store the more you understand how the app store
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.880]   all in not just the apple apple app store but others have sort of trained the market that apps
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.080]   should be free they're going to be supported by ads they're going to find a way to steal
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.280]   data from us and use that what used to pay for the app the more that goes on the more we're being
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:16.280]   trained not to pay for apps and that is absolutely not sustainable for anybody who's making anything
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.960]   of value if it's a value anticipate paying for it if you like it show you show your love not just
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.360]   by sending an email saying I love your product say I love your product here have some money that's
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.880]   how that's how you it works yeah and I think that if something's free I either feel like they're
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.840]   taking something that I didn't that I don't know about or or I'm afraid they're not going to last
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.120]   you know like it and you know there's or there's something there's I always look looking around the
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.640]   corner like what's going on here if it's free and I don't have a problem I mean I think that I'm
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.120]   I'm probably pretty insensitive I don't buy as many apps as I used to I think I probably bought
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.840]   two or three apps a week for a long time and now I kind of like oh I don't know if I need that or
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:59.240]   not or I'll buy a whole bunch in one area that I'm looking at but I you know two three four I think
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.360]   once once I get over four ninety nine I go I really need this app like like that's the thing and
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:09.400]   then I have to admit that I'm super sensitive to subscriptions because they just sneak up on me
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.000]   you know and I suddenly I suddenly realized there was some point where I realized I had like a hundred
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   few dollars a month going out in subscriptions to stuff that I wasn't using anymore and I just
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.160]   hadn't noticed so now I'm super so like if I have a one-year subscription I a week after I sign up
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.600]   for it I usually just go into the apps I go into my my management tool and I just in inside of you
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:35.400]   know the I you know your profile and I just cancel it and then I just go when I get if I get to the
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.320]   a year and I remember or a month or whatever the the the iteration is and I'm still using it I'll
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.040]   fix that but otherwise I want it to automatically just turn off you know because otherwise at all
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.840]   because I definitely spent hundreds of dollars with some companies that you know and so I think
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.160]   that the subscription thing I become super sensitive to I mean I think it's a I think it's I think
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.480]   it makes sense in a lot of ways for a lot of companies but I think when you get you get over
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.280]   subscription you know and and that's the that's the real problem with it I think notability the
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.760]   hard part with some of these is if you don't have a real niche you know I've had notability since
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.000]   it was released then I still think the problem is is that it competes with notes for me like you
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.040]   know I have notability or I have notes which is on everything you know that's and it's seamless
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.800]   and Apple seems to spend a lot of money on it I mean developing it because it keeps on getting
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:29.320]   better so so I so the I think that that's the the hard part is getting people to to turn the corner
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.640]   on something that already kind of exists in the OS I have some friends that have built apps that
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.920]   just keep making money and they don't they don't do that much to them they just they just
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.600]   come up in a search because there's only two or three of them in the world that do it you know
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.480]   you'd be surprised at how many there's not that many apps that show you how to make certain things
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.120]   and so so it's it's a and they just keep you know and it's not it's not enough money to retire on
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:58.200]   but it's enough money to pay the lease in your house so so so it's so it's so it's so I think
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   it just depends on what market you get into as well.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.360]   One thing I've been saying about this for years is and it's gets me a lot of hate and it's really
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.080]   unpopular but I think it's still true is that we've gone from an like and an app store is
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:16.680]   of absolutely accelerated but we've gone from an age where apps were extremely scarce and extremely
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.560]   valuable and you bought them every few years and they cost office cost of fortune Adobe cost of
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:27.640]   fortune Final Cut cost of fortune most at like I remember on the palm trio my uh sticky notes app
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:32.360]   was 50 bucks you know and like it was they were all major investments because they were so
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:39.000]   scarce and so new and app stores have hastened the transformation of apps from this scarcity to
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.200]   abundance they've become pop the same way music has the same way films have the same way like
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.760]   there are very few musicians who make significant amounts of money there's very few bloggers I mean
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:54.040]   we have destroyed a lot of the value of news and we've we've seen this it's totally commoditized it
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.920]   and anybody can sing anybody can make a video but a lot of people do not make any significant amount
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.400]   of money from these things and I think there was a real dissonance in the understanding like there
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.800]   was a gold rush in the beginning of the app store in the play store where we saw stories about
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:12.280]   developers making hundreds of thousands of dollars a week and that's because this was all fresh and
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.520]   new but then you know developers started racing to the bottom customers learned if they waited
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.920]   things would get cheaper Apple kept creating more and more kept commoditizing more and more apps to
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.560]   create more and more value about hardware created this vicious cycle that I think was inevitable but
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:31.880]   was vastly accelerated and now we're at an age where yeah like p-calc is wonderful it's a $10
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.440]   calculator app there's very little room for other $10 calculator apps maybe another $4 one
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.520]   and then the rest have to be like you know free or very very inexpensive and category after category
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.760]   have followed that pattern there are some where there's still a little bit of robust competition
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:51.480]   especially if you can get enterprise you know money into what you're doing but otherwise there's just
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.160]   so many millions of apps and people can download them and they're supported by venture capitalists
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.400]   or by massive social networks that don't have to make any money off of it and that just makes it
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:07.240]   incredibly hard to compete you have to do exactly what what Alex said and that is like there's medical
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.480]   apps there's aviation apps there are things where people it's literally time over money and they
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.600]   will pay you a small fortune to do something incredibly important to them but those those again those
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.040]   aren't the the big apps that you see everywhere the big apps you see everywhere they're free to
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.280]   download the netflix's and all of that thing so I think it's just it's something we have to come
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:30.600]   to terms with I love I love love our indie developer friends but I also love our indie blogger friends
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.400]   our indie youtuber friends our indie musician friends and they all face the same problem now
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.240]   and it's not going to get easier you've just got to get more and more creative and you've got to
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:47.960]   catch that zeitgeist when you can I think that's well put I think that we I do think that a lot of
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:54.200]   talk is made about community which I talk about a lot that I work on is the developers you know
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:59.000]   are we're moving for all for everyone we're moving out of a time when you can make this work with
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.720]   advertising alone we're moving out of a time when you can just put something out and sell it you
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.760]   really have to figure out how you're going to engage the audience that you want to you know to to
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.440]   interact with you know and so I think the developers have to figure out a way they become part of a
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.360]   community or build a community around what they're doing you know I know that we have some developers
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.920]   that are within you know within the office hours community and you know they're responsive and
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.680]   they're figuring stuff out with the community and they're making adjustments against it and you know
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.840]   what happens a lot of people buy their software you know like they they're buying their software
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.040]   because because they know that they've got you know they're getting tools you know the community
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.680]   is actually the developers who are being responsive and they're being part of the they're part of our
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.760]   sometimes they come on office hours they're in after hours answering questions they're on our
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.560]   in discord talking to folks about it making adjustments and putting out new things and at that point
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.160]   everyone feels like well that's the that's the person I should be I should be using that software
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:55.880]   over another software that looks the same because I have a relationship with that that person and
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.840]   you know a lot of us have gone to certain restaurants because we've relationship with the you know the
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.600]   owner comes out and says hi and the waiter knows what you want and you know there's all these other
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.640]   things that you have and you go there above everything else because of the service and because you feel
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.920]   connected and I think that as things need as things continue to separate I think that the developers
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.880]   that kind of figure that model out are going to do much better you know over time than developers
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.520]   that think they can just put out a product and just have it work you know like just just just
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:28.600]   sell it by itself you know all of the stuff all the products that I've sold in the last 20 years
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.360]   evolving based on having a large community that was already connected to to me or to my company
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.880]   that bought into it when they when we when we sold something that when we were selling
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   db mat back in the the aughts that was all people who you know knew what I did you know and I think
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.840]   that developers thinking that they can just develop it and not and just survive on that because
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.760]   it's going to get harder that that hill is going to get just keep getting steeper so
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:01.000]   agreed all right a couple of other things there's a report that suggests that apple is cutting back
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.160]   on iPad production in order to meet demand for iPhone shipments so due to I mean we just keep
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:18.840]   hearing about the supply shortage shortages rather and apparently in order to reallocate the components
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.960]   to the iPhone they're cutting back on on iPad shipments so that seems like what is being said
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.400]   is that you know the components that would work for both the iPad and the iPhone they're taking
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.080]   those and saying okay you're making them let's make sure we have enough iPhones on stock to get
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.320]   those out which I guess you know it's kind of nice you can always tell which you can always tell
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:44.920]   which one has more margin you know what this one will put this one off a little bit or which
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.840]   one's making the most the most money for the company and so the iPhone is still the winner of that
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.840]   and they need to make sure that people aren't going getting frustrated and not able to buy a
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.600]   phone then go buy something else yeah they did they did say that explicitly during the
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.440]   they did say that explicitly they're saying anything please go ahead go
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:07.080]   yeah that they they said that they expect iPad sales to decline year over year I don't remember if
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.520]   they said specifically we're reallocating our capacity so much as they just simply said that
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.640]   well we've got supply constraints but they also promised that they also promised that oh but
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.480]   other categories are going to grow and are well protected so I can't I didn't listen I've been
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.560]   trying to recall transcripts that didn't actually watch it live but yeah so they did acknowledge
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:32.280]   that directly and it's not surprising yeah they didn't say they were feeding they were you know
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.080]   taking from iPad to feed iPhone right they just said that the iPhone had been supply constrained
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.320]   and the iPad was expected to be supply constrained next and I think there was some confusion because
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.280]   Apple said they were being hit by shortages but they once again said legacy nodes and that
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:50.520]   confuses people because they start to think oh it's Intel like why is Apple blaming Intel it's not
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.800]   like Intel is also leading edge node legacy nodes are all those little controller chips when you're
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:00.360]   talking about a leading edge node Apple's not constrained they buy so much of the five nanometer
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.240]   process and the seven nanometer process still that Taiwan semiconductor is putting out you know they
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.080]   basically prepay the whole thing they get it off the ground but there's all these other components
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.880]   that are still like on 90 nanometers and more that just there's little switching communication
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.080]   chips and controller chips that are and all the other components that Apple uses and those have been
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.320]   heavily supply constrained there was even a comment that like yes cars are facing a
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.240]   car a chip shortage but it's because they won't pay for the the modern stuff they really want the
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:33.000]   cheap legacy stuff and that's still highly constrained so I think it's just it's a reflection of the
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.560]   legacy nodes still not reaching coming back to capacity yeah got it uh the other one I wanted
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:46.200]   to mention before we take a quick break and come back with our picks um Apple has it can can use to
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:53.720]   work on its uh Apple podcast subscription service uh in fact Twit is one of the folks who was is
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.840]   one of the groups that has subscriptions for each of the audio versions of our podcast on Apple
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.280]   Podcasts I think it's two ninety nine a month you can subscribe for an ad-free version of the
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:14.840]   audio podcast um now Apple is working with the BBC and with Slate bringing some extra features
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:24.680]   via those two uh those two folks I guess those two groups uh so BBC studios and uh Slate itself
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.360]   it says the show five minutes on already exists but if you were to try to access the landing page
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.440]   you'd get an error message it um BBC studios is calling these previously localized programs
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.800]   exclusives and there will be more coming soon so these were kind of region locked before and so
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:47.080]   you could only play them in the UK now they're going to be available to people outside of the UK
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:53.560]   through this subscription service and then Slate it says that it has launched its own Apple podcast
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:14:02.360]   subscription and you could get uh ad-free listening and bonus content which is uh it's Slate+ program
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:10.680]   so some shows that aren't available elsewhere or shows that have ads you can get without any ads
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:18.040]   through Apple's subscription service so continuing to see some players play in the space I am curious
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:24.360]   have any of you folks checked out the subscription service through Apple podcast is that something
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:30.920]   that you you know could see yourself doing or are you more you know more likely to go and subscribe
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.400]   and the way that our club twit for example is set up where you've got kind of a member full
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:41.560]   subscription does this in app thing work for you my my big issue uh is that I don't use Apple
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.960]   podcast as my main podcast app and so for me it's easier to use one that generates kind of a link
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:53.080]   on its own but I think if I did use Apple podcast I could see why I would use your your you're
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.760]   absolutely right I don't like being locked into one one player because on every single device that
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:05.000]   I own Apple uh Apple windows Android everything it depends on what device it is what mood I'm in
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.160]   so that really doesn't work for me also I would much I realize that I'm asking creators to do
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.800]   things the way that I want them to do it but I would much rather they have a patreon or some sort of
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:22.280]   their own like self self funding uh membership thing where I can just simply go to their patreon
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:27.240]   decide how much money uh how much money up a month I want to give them uh if they if they say that
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:32.280]   hey by the way if you want to continue to get our podcast like the day that their release as
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.360]   opposed to access to the archives we're gonna need five bucks a month for many podcasts I would
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:40.840]   absolutely do that because the the great thing about services like patreon is that it's not just
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:46.440]   about as I said before I love your I love the thing you created here is some money to validate
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:52.680]   exactly how much I like it uh it's also you're becoming part of a more well connected community
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.760]   of people who support the show more valid private discussions around these shows so I don't think
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:03.960]   that subscriptions through Apple podcast or Google podcast or through YouTube memberships I don't
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:10.600]   think that they create all of the value that a a creator can get through trying to find a way to
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:18.760]   do that more independently well said uh Renee what about you I you know I have I have much
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.640]   the same feeling uh as Andy I and I say this is someone you know full disclosure I have a service
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:29.800]   called nebula that I helped found that has podcast without advertising in it um and then when you
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.400]   subscribe to that you get all the podcasts without advertising and I find like that that's the sort
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.240]   of thing I'm gravitating towards I'm even getting annoyed by streaming services because they all
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.920]   have different shows and I want to watch a bunch of those shows and I got to subscribe to eight
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.920]   different streaming services now just to watch the shows I want where like this is a solved
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.200]   problem for music whether I want Apple music or Spotify uh previously Spotify now they're you
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.480]   know well thank goodness they're ripping off Joe Rogan I don't have to listen to him anymore but
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.760]   their shows I do want to listen to um you know they're becoming exclusive and I hate that I
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.800]   would much rather they come everyone had similar content and I got to I got to pick which service
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.280]   best suited my needs but I realize we don't live in that age anymore and this is much the same like
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.880]   I love that Apple and Google and everybody is patronizing you know podcasts uh to a certain degree
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.560]   but it means you have to have eight different apps and eight different services and eight
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.720]   different subscriptions to get everything you want and I think that's ultimately worse for the
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:30.120]   consumer I agree Alex any thoughts yeah I mean I know I have to admit that now that I'm used to
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.120]   live conversation the whole time I don't listen to as many podcasts as I used to I think that that
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.960]   I think that I think that's the hard part I listen to some of the twit podcasts I listen to this
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.440]   American life I listen to a you know handful of other ones but my time frame is so constrained
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:48.360]   because I spend a couple hours a day in office hours that I don't I realize that all my time that
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:54.040]   was that I had before um listening to podcasts and NPR and everything else have been you know
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.280]   the because office hours runs 24/7 now if I want to listen to something I just turned on
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.320]   just I just play I just open up zoom and I just listen to it and there's some geeky conversation
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.800]   going on in the background that isn't what I find interesting about that is not organized and it's
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.120]   not uh you know written and it's not there's no structure to it it's just people talking about
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.720]   geeky things and it's not always about media either but it's kind of geeky discussion and so I found
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.280]   myself I was thinking about it well and in Renee we're talking I was like what do I listen to and
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:28.040]   I still listen to a handful but it's really gotten down I just don't I haven't found any new ones and
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:35.320]   I and I will admit that I'm painfully uh particular about audio you know at this point and so I
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:41.640]   right right if if someone's podcast isn't done with a really I mean with really good audio I don't
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.880]   I just can't listen to it I can barely listen to NPR at this point like you know it's like it
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.600]   like the phone the phone the phoneers drive me crazy you know like I just it just like I just
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.520]   like I don't I don't want to I can't do that so I so I um uh so I think that that's the other thing
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.440]   is that I'm kind of used to just hearing good audio all the time and I have a hard time listening
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.560]   to bad audio for very long more than a couple minutes so I mean it's as enjoyable because my
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:11.160]   my schedule is so tight that I uh it has to kind of be just right and so I've noticed that I just
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.000]   haven't listened I'm surprised at how many podcasts are done by people who don't pay attention to
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.040]   their microphone like we've been doing this for a long time like we've been doing this for it's
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:25.960]   been 15 years now like yeah you know like if you're gonna spend the time to put something on on
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:32.360]   podcasts you really need a a radio mic that's you know and I like like act go at what we can say
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.600]   I was just a thousand percent agree yes I don't understand like I don't understand like it's
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.360]   not they're not that expensive but I I'm just like I turned someone's podcast on the
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.520]   me oh I got this new podcast and I'll check it out and I turned on I'm like no like I like it like
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:50.840]   you know like I'm not by I'm not gonna like I don't get what you're saying I just can't hear it so
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.440]   so I think that um I know I've noticed it and I think definitely after 15 years at the beginning
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.480]   we were just happy to get something online but after 15 years the tools have gotten really good
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.600]   and I'm always amazed that someone thinks that making a podcast with bad audio would be
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:12.600]   you know okay you know or even viable so it's just and still it's still I would argue 90% of the
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:18.360]   podcasts are bad audio so wow and they just keep making more
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:25.160]   but most most of them are good enough but I much I'm more swayed by content than by so
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:30.440]   so it's all it's all it's all it's all the audio is at least a C or a C plus I'll stick with it
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.480]   it's the people that are like hi could you I know I know that you're using your phone's
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.960]   microphone but could you like take off the kazoo that you've taped to the microphone maybe that
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:45.560]   would help me hear a little bit better yeah I just got a tape over my microphone girl
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:51.080]   all right let's take a quick break so I can tell you about coinbase week before we come back

[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:38.760]   picks of the week and eenie meenie meenie mo Alex we're going to start with you and your pick
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:47.000]   oh we got you muted again sorry uh so i had the opportunity i've become super someone mentioned on
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.120]   on twitter that that i they can hear me swallowing so now i i'm constantly muted but they drink
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.960]   constantly muted and i finally like i just want to thank the person whoever did that
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.120]   it's been 800 dollars on this little box that just showed up last night so that i don't until i
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.880]   can push a little button that mutes me and and then lets me do a bunch of other things to it so
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:11.480]   thank you very much it's very expensive twitter follower so anyway anyway so you know i was like
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:17.880]   oh anyway so so the um i just had the opportunity to do a pretty cool project in cinema 4d and i
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:22.760]   just wanted to recommend it to the new versions out and it's just such a powerful 3d application so
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:27.800]   for those of you who don't know what cinema 4d is it's a it's a 3d application and in the broadcast
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:32.360]   world it has kind of taken over so there there are lots of you know there's blender blender's free
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.800]   and then some people model in moto and then there's mia and hudini and there's and on the other end and
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.560]   and there those are kind of high-end more specialized tools for for large facilities but for the day
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:49.640]   to day i want to do a great broadcast graphics when we talked to some friends that of mine that
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:55.240]   work in broadcast everybody's using cinema and so this is really and the you know the new version of
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:00.040]   course just gets better there's some you know some modifiers that are really cool they have some
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.720]   spline imports and capsules but the bottom line is is that's more of an excuse just to talk about
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.800]   the fact that i've been using this app for like 20 years and i kind of went away from it for a
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.560]   couple years and came back and played with it i was like wow this thing is powerful and it's just
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.320]   so much like when you want to be when you're really serious about i want to actually do some
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:20.840]   3d work it's just got a lot of bells and whistles that are that are really great and they've got a
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.360]   subscription now that you can get so you don't spend the i don't know thousands of dollars that it used
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.240]   to be you can spend i don't know 79 bucks a month or 50 bucks a month or something like that to get
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.240]   you know to get cinema if it's something that you think and they have a trial version of it and i
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:38.440]   just it's just such a pleasurable app to work in and and we're getting really into it because we're
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.680]   using it as part of our pipeline we're going to talk about it tomorrow in office hours
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:51.240]   moto and cinema are the two places that we're generating are 3d models for USDZ and USDZ of
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:59.240]   course is apples kind of internal 3d tool that you know 3d format that is being used to you can
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:04.280]   open it in preview you can open it in motion and final cut and i think that that market's about
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:09.880]   to explode like in a massive way and so if you're trying to figure out what you're doing next and
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.320]   you have some interest in that i would definitely download it we're going to be talking a lot about
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:20.600]   it in office hours but it's one of the key apps to generating the geometry and making that work so
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.520]   anyway it's a great application if you're thinking about 3d that's i mean i think blender is a great
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.920]   place to get started but as soon as you have more less time and more money the cinema is the next
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.720]   step because it takes a lot less time to get a lot more done so blender is great because it's not
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:41.400]   it doesn't cost as much it just doesn't have the the same feature set and so so it's uh it's a
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:48.360]   really powerful application and i'd recommend checking out well inquiring minds would also like to know
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:55.080]   about your mute switch uh i know it wasn't your pick but i was gonna recommend it next week
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:01.880]   and you know so that's fine this is the mute switch that i got um so this is a uh so this is my
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:09.560]   my i won't use i've used up to now um this is a studio technologies uh it's called a model 205
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:16.360]   and so what this does is this has this runs off of Dante so this is a PoE so power over ethernet
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:23.240]   takes in it sits on a Dante network Dante is the um is the audio now it's an it's an audio over IP
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.760]   network that i use in my home studio and so it passes all the audio that you would have normally
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.600]   with cables it just passes them um over ethernet and you can reroute things to lots of different
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:40.120]   you know functions and so on so forth and so so anyway so this has a Dante uh Dante port on it
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:44.440]   and then it also takes you know you can have a mic loop through it and what it does we've used
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:49.400]   i don't know i've had many of these this is the smallest one i've ever bought um at least expensive
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:57.000]   which is very scary anyway so wow um uh so uh so yeah so this one was i think about seven hundred
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.400]   dollars but what it does is you can program it to do a lot of different things now it over Dante
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:08.200]   i have i can have three sources and three inputs and so i have my uh talk button but i also have two
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:14.520]   talkbacks so um these talkbacks are so that if i have comms if i have comms in the show so i can
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.400]   hear other channels so instead of just getting one channel in my ear from the headphone jack here
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.880]   instead of having one channel i can have two other channels going into my ear and what's nice about
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.160]   that is that i could have a producer somewhere else talking to me about the show and i can hear
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.320]   that and i have independent control over the the volume of what those are so those are they're not
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:39.240]   mixed into my show um audio they're separate so i can control the volume of each one of those
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.840]   also i can set up things where i if i push down talk back it turns off my mic
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:50.440]   so so you can push you can set different ways for this to work together um so i can i can have
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.120]   some control over it and um but then so it's it's a little it's a lot more than a than a um you know
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   kind of a cough button and this is a this is really a uh um this is an announcer panel and you see a
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:10.760]   lot of these when we um work in broadcast you know high-end podcast uh studios um for big companies
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:15.720]   and and also for uh broadcast you see a lot of studio technologies boxes like this and again this
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.920]   is a i know this is a tiny one uh i've had ones that have you know three or four of these buttons and
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:26.040]   it's much bigger and does all analog and um what i was really kind of excited about is that it sits
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:34.520]   on uh Dante so i'm i'm slowly rewiring all of my uh office into a x uh baron direct 32 that has
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.360]   lots of channels and processing but it's all over Dante i don't want to deal with all the cables and
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.320]   so so having just something over Dante that lets that work to it so that's that's what this is it's
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:51.000]   it's the most geeky cough button ever so yes indeed so anyway so but and it it's pretty quiet i can
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.560]   still hear it but but it's it's not too bad so so anyway so that's uh so i'm gonna but i'm kind of
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:02.920]   i'm in the process of remodeling my uh or just planning and all the gear keeps on showing up
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.640]   where i'm about to re kind of rebuild my my studio and um and so i'm this like not this weekend but
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.000]   probably another two weeks from now i'm probably going to tear it apart put it back together you
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.800]   won't notice anything it'll all look the same to you but the front end up for me will be completely
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:22.680]   changed as i as i work in it that's just part one of the tools anyway that's it let's do
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.520]   new technologies model 205 well thank you for that extra pick i'm sorry i stole one for me for next

[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.040]   hurry all right so my pick of the week uh you know we were talking previously and he was saying like
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.880]   he likes to support creators directly if you have a patreon that's always a great way there's
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:23.320]   memberships on youtube there's all sorts of ways one of my favorites is merch just because you get
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.040]   to see creatives being really really creative and one of the things i picked up this week because i'm
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:34.840]   always looking for new and fun ways uh to support people is sarah dichy's new peachy air pod uh case
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:39.320]   and it's hard to tell on this but it's got a bunch of little peaches on it then it says
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:45.400]   stay peachy on the back of it uh which is just a hell of cute you can get it in pink you can get
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.520]   it in black mark has brownly like if this is not your style mark has brownly has a case he has a
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:55.960]   watch band now as well i've got his rubik's cube which even i can solve it's just ridiculously
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:01.160]   easy for anybody who wants to to get this right but there's just such like there's t-shirts that
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.080]   everybody always has t-shirts but increasingly we're getting much more interesting stuff yes
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:11.160]   you know iphone cases are an obvious one but air pods cases and bobblehead figures i don't
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.880]   want to have it here but they have you know alana pierce has a as a bobblehead figure available now
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.880]   is just so much really cool and interesting stuff so i love this i love that i support
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:24.280]   creators directly i love that they're working with companies to make really cool interesting
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:28.360]   versions of the stuff that i'm going to use and buy anyway so why not do it in a way that helps
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:34.040]   support them as well yeah that's awesome moment reach out to me so we can create an all of green
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:41.080]   air pods pro case my case oh man yeah that's though that's super cool that's super cool all right
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:45.960]   andy and not go tell me about your pick of the week you know it's it's kind of interesting that
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:51.320]   we were talking about subscription apps today because this was i had the great example of why
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:56.440]   subscription apps sometimes work because my pick of the week is adobe lightroom mobile as
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.720]   especially because of the update they just pushed out a few days ago this is what i this is when
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:06.680]   subscription apps work great that's not just well you get to use the same app you've always been
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:11.640]   using except for now you have to keep paying for it every single month that's not an easy sell
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:16.760]   what i am hoping for is that i'll get an experience like i've had with lightroom where just i'm
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:21.960]   i'm taking a selfie in front of uh in front of the metropolitan opera house i don't i don't have my
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:26.440]   full costume on i have the civilian version of the cloten none of the accessories that make the
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.760]   looks so to speak and i just i'm about to post like a really really happy self hey i can't believe
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.160]   after 18 20 months i'm finally like in new york i'm finally at the metaropa i'm finally hey i'm
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:40.840]   really really happy and i i'm about to and i maybe want to do a couple quick edits to it i'm not
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.120]   i'm not an influencer i don't want to have i make sure that that porcelain skin make sure that i have
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:50.920]   like the eyes like twice as big i get i'm not an influencer i just want to look at i just want
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:57.800]   i i i influence bad people to do worse things but thank you for a kind but but what i'm getting
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   at is that i like i enjoy uh lightroom on mobile because it allows you to do simple things that
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.960]   make into a better picture and usually i'm talking about just simple things like well i want to sort
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:12.680]   of just get the background a little bit lighter a little bit darker so i it was it was an overcast
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.440]   day so i didn't really pop from the background a little bit so open up lightroom so by the way
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.680]   there's an update with new features okay fine i've got time to kill update with new features
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:29.480]   the new features include these amazing new object mask modes where uh now the the simplest
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:34.600]   one the most dramatic one was that it uses ai and it'll basically it's kind of selfie i just took
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:39.480]   was oh i see there's a human being in front of something else i could automatically create a mask
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.040]   for the human being so if you want the human to be lighter or change the colors or change the
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.640]   detail you can easily do that and it's in beta it took like about you know maybe half a minute to
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.200]   download it and update it but as soon as i did without knowing anything about how it worked there's
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:59.480]   obviously a quick little tutorial but i just you just tap a button saying get you select the
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:04.120]   foreground figure and then here i am selected and all outlined in red and then great make this a
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:09.320]   little bit brighter and i'm a little bit brighter and i'm like oh my god this will save me so much
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.840]   time and there are lots of other things they've done to it that would take me a long time and
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.560]   to be really remembered i've got really really enthusiastic about it and give you and now in our
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.520]   number two let me talk about how you can now subtract masks and lay masks just these simple
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.760]   things on a phone where once again you don't necessarily want to make this a studio looking
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.000]   portrait it's not that you're getting a hundred thousand dollars for an ad placement and so you
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.880]   want to make sure that whatever this is that you're mashing up against your face like this is sponsored
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:42.120]   by sony battery you want to make sure that that that you look as good as possible but sometimes
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.760]   it's just like gee this could be a better a better photo gee i really don't want to i but it's not
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.880]   worth the time to just mask off my entire my entire body just to make that make it pop a
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.640]   little bit more but in terms of like type tapping on a new button that puts all the masking features
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:01.720]   and then typing on tapping on please select the foreground figure or please select the sky
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.240]   absolutely sign me up so this is this is why i continue to spend like 10 bucks a month for light
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:13.160]   room mobile it makes it the i keep saying that the the most uh i don't really have any games on my
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.680]   phones because the most fun app i have is light room mobile taking a snapshot and in the time it
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.160]   takes for me to wait for my bus or the time that i'm taking on the commuter rail trying to turn
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.800]   that into a real photograph just for the fun of it and just seeing what i can turn this thing into
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:32.760]   and light room mobile really does it for me but these new features just elevate what you can do
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:39.160]   on a phone for god's sakes to a much much higher level can i just add that i took the pixel core
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:45.080]   course and i learned from Alex Lindsey and everybody how to painstakingly uh composite your avatar
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.720]   like take the background away and have like a perfect version of you with no background and
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.800]   now like you press a button a neural engine spins up and it just does it better than you ever could
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:36:01.080]   and you feel hard because we get it yeah this is your normal because it's like i i i i now a lot
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:06.360]   of the presets in light room and not so much instagram but but in many apps it's like ah thank
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.400]   good i'll post it because i've just taken like an hour and a half to get this i want to get the
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.800]   color grading correctly and i want to get the light sources exactly how i want and i want to maybe
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:20.280]   put give it some more and then i've taken again my train is pulling to the station so i hit send
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.000]   and then like as i'm putting myself together oh gee i wonder what these presets do like oh i took
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.480]   that took a half a second and it's like ten times better than what i just spent 90 minutes.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.600]   There's a little fine here button now.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.440]   Again you press a button and it does the hair for you.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.720]   Reduce goofiness put that push that slider for me all the way to the right.
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:44.120]   You know i i i'm always just amazed i've been doing this long enough i think all all of us have
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.800]   been doing this long enough that you just are amazed at what's possible and people complain about
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.120]   it you're just like it's going to space like i mean like it's just like you have no idea you know
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:56.840]   like what what we used to have to it's it's it's it's a magical time you know like when i think
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.280]   about the photogrammetry and i just pick up my phone i'm like oh i want i'm 3d model of this and i just
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:07.000]   go i just wave my phone around i mean i did this in the 90s where i had to do it by hand from photos
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.320]   i had to build 3d models with boxes and we'd figure out the parallax and we'd do a thing we didn't
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.440]   know where the lens you know it was it was a thing like a block would take i don't know how long to
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.360]   do and now it's like oh i wave my phone around and i have a 3d model it's just it's amazing.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:30.840]   all right folks my pick this week is so first of all i gotta i gotta say everybody pronounces
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:38.760]   this company's name differently so i went to the actual youtube of the company and listened to them
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:46.200]   say the name a thousand times to make sure that we got it right this is satachi's latest adapter
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:52.920]   and it's the usb c hybrid adapter and i mean already on its own i really like satachi's products
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:58.520]   because they make a lot of great sort of color matched and theme matched products for your apple
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:08.040]   devices it's got usb c on one side and on the other side you get an hdmi you get two usb a ports
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:15.160]   and one power pastor port so i could plug this in i could have hdmi out from an ipad and i could
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:23.240]   also have uh two standard usb devices to plug into it but that's not all this this thing does
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:30.760]   on the back of it is a little thing that pops open or closes and inside if i can pop it open
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:42.440]   is space to drop in an ssd card so i can well ssd drive i can slot in and yes and m.2 ssd drive
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.680]   but it's the sata right it's or the ssd drive not the nvme
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:53.080]   that is correct it does yes it does not do the nvme so not just only because if you i'm just
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.960]   letting you know that if you try to force an mvme into that space uh it will work it will it will
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:03.400]   go in with enough pressure it just won't work not not that not that i've ever done that before
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:09.640]   not i was gonna say that's good to know maybe from experience yeah so they show on the back of
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:16.200]   it it plugged into a macbook uh so you could imagine you know expanding your storage space if you want
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:22.680]   to or passing this between different devices uh we were i think you gentlemen were just talking last
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:29.080]   week about kind of one of the things with taking um video on the iphone is how long it takes to get
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:36.200]   it over to the macbook after order to the whatever computer you're using for it uh and yeah some
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.120]   some ability to get that transferred faster is quite nice uh this i just think this is a super
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:47.560]   cool idea where you've got kind of an all-in-one device that makes it easy to move between different
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:53.880]   computers or devices depending on if you're working on an ipad or your mac itself so just plug that
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:00.200]   into the side and it's good to go uh reswas is asking in the discord if it's um if it's
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:07.560]   thunderbolt no it is usb c uh i'm not sure which version three times as much and get a thunderbolt
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:14.760]   version if you want there you go yes exactly so this one is available for 90 bucks um and it's a
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:23.720]   nice smelt little adapter that has multiple usb ports hdmi out and that usb c on the side again
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:30.040]   sat on not on the end sorry does it does it but does it work if you don't have a storage card
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.000]   inside there so can i can i buy it and then like in the future inside in the future when i want to
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.120]   add like a terabyte to it i can add to it that is a good question and yes yes you can use it without
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:45.400]   having to slot in storage so yeah that's kind of how i bought it was it's it's future proof
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:50.840]   not 90 bucks is not cheap but it's but it's such a i would spend a little extra for this version
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.480]   to know that in the future i will have one less damn dongles with one damn less thing to
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:01.080]   plug in someplace yeah i have the i think i've recommended the satachi um the base for the mac
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:04.920]   mini it's very similar to that except it just sits as a base underneath it's formed around the
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.280]   mac mini and i put the the sata drives in first i put one of the mvme's in then i then i learned
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.520]   that's what the sata drives in so i was like yo i just want to keep on saying that because i was
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.760]   like i didn't even know there was another version because i i build nvme drives all the time like
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.320]   little enclosures you know for them all the time so i just thought oh it's an mvme and i just ordered
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:31.000]   i ordered some mvme's and yeah it doesn't it wasn't the same so in fact it's kind of funny on the back
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.440]   if you look very closely uh at the photo you can see that it's the sam san
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:44.520]   840 evo or 860 evo they have there's there's a version of both of those and the problem is is
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:50.280]   that on the one that's in the in the satachi one it still only has the one plastic pin instead of
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.160]   the two that the sata so the sata has two plastic pins but they're only using one and so that's why
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:59.320]   when i looked at it i was like wow that's me and so it's a little it's just a little and they fit
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:05.960]   they will it will fit with them i was just i just thought it was being difficult so i but it did
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:13.560]   it did work but it didn't work i mean it did eventually go you know so but uh yeah anyway yeah so be mindful
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:20.200]   folks be mindful so let's say that all right that brings us to the end of this episode of mac

[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.640]   miss anything i just mentioned you don't listen to mac break until the weekend or whatever but tomorrow
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:32.840]   we're talking about usdz so we're gonna break down how how we just used usdz to build a model and
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:38.360]   the pipeline that actually works you know because that's been a process to figure out hundreds of
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.640]   hours of us well in one hour we'll save you weeks of work if you decide you want to do that um
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:50.520]   we're also in this process of moving on i know to 4k htr immersive with this giant engine that
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:56.440]   that does the editing for us it will partially allows anybody to edit the show on a ipad or or
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:01.160]   a web interface and so on thursday we'll talk about how it's working and what's working what's
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:06.360]   not working and where it's complete open projects so we're just showing you exactly how the calculations
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:10.440]   are made and how we're using isadora for this and universe for that and you know we're tying into
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:14.520]   an atem and we're doing all this stuff it's really cool so it's it's a really cool moment to watch
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.520]   what we're doing um and then friday we've got someone coming in from zoom talking about events
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.600]   and conferences and so uh so we'll be doing that and then of course saturday we have educators
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:28.760]   coming in uh we're also we're we've educated education on saturday we're cooking um some spicy
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.560]   scrambled eggs which should be really good and um and then we're going to belfast for a concert
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.880]   so we're uh so we're virtually taking over a thing so it's a very wide range of
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.600]   wide range of things that we're learning so something about the way that and we'll be
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:47.320]   and we'll be and and chef tell we'll be coming in to show us how to make a spicy egg deletion
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:52.280]   it sounds like you're doing like a regional morning show now it is it is what what's funny is is it's
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.600]   so it's so the love of the like to come in to find out how to put the spice back into your relationship
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.280]   this thanks yeah yeah so it's it's amazing we have domnianti gajar who's who's in south africa and um
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:07.000]   and she's showing us these indian dishes from south africa and so we're doing these these mixes
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.440]   and so it's it's technically it's garam masala mix you know and how to put that into yeah and so
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.760]   we make it together and what's interesting is we're finding i really feel like we're in the beginning
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:21.800]   of like then a new generation of cooking because when you watch cooking on shows they cut it all
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.760]   together so fast that you couldn't actually do it it's it's really more of a passive experience
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.920]   we're going at a speed where we're talking about it and we're doing it and we're figuring it all out
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:35.400]   and we've got everybody's got multiple papers so so it's a it's a different it's only a handful of
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.400]   us doing it but it's a it's a it's really a show and i was talking to someone this morning about it
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.440]   and they're like you know i i watched a lot of cooking shows but i never i'm never tempted to
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.120]   actually try to cook them and they're like this one i was like oh i think i can do that you know it's
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:50.440]   much more approachable and so but what we're really doing is experimenting with it's just an easy
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.800]   thing that everybody does that we can experiment with the idea of collaborative learning
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:46:00.360]   using zoom you know like how do we do that a global collaborative learning project and cooking
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.240]   is just the context for it right now but um so anyway yeah it's it is funny though when i when i
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.600]   list it off i always realize how absurd our Saturdays are so because then and then we're going to
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.880]   Belfast for a concert where everyone takes over all the hardware from all over the world so you've
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.040]   got one person calling the show in Boston another one cutting it in Jamaica another one you know doing
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.520]   the doing the uh they're literally running the lights over DMX from somewhere else in the world
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.600]   and so it's uh it's a it's a it's a very eclectic day we call it the long day because it starts at
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:36.040]   five in the morning and ends at like two or three in the afternoon so anyway awesome awesome and
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:45.640]   of course Andy the opera nato uh when can folks find you or listen to you on wgbh Boston and
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:53.400]   anything else you want to pitch uh i'm usually on Fridays this week i'm on at noon go to wgbhnews.org
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.920]   and you can stream it live or come back a few hours afterward and you'll they'll have the show
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:02.360]   posted and usually my segment also broken out and so you can listen to it later i will say that my
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.400]   a it's always great to have you as as the host love speaking for you love doing anything with you
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:13.080]   uh the one little one little thing is that uh so i did mention that i did have my my my new pixel
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:20.520]   six pro every time i have said like uh hey mica it's assumed that it's hey google and so now i have
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:26.520]   so many little i have so many little like snippets of like things that i have just said like again
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:36.440]   like here we are that is really interesting why my name well it's it's hey and then data the
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:43.240]   to staccato sort of so perhaps also maybe it's just that powerful i don't know or maybe it's just
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:49.080]   screwed up who knows one of those things you're all right well word mica
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.360]   exactly again again it gets everybody's attention even even uh digital assistance
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.640]   there you go uh well i'll have to be very quiet with several digital assistance behind me listening
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:05.480]   uh folks this is now the end of this episode of mac break weekly thank you for tuning in
