[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Lots to talk about. But before we get into the news of the week,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   we've got to talk about what we're going to see next week at Apple's WWDC.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   It's a very interesting predictions. We've got the finalists for the Apple Design Awards

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And there's no news, which is why this is always a fun show.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That's Andy Inaco from WGBH in Boston and points East.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Hello, it's great. The pressure's off.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   We don't have to have any facts ready.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   We don't have to have any understanding of complex issues, how they relate to one of the world's most influential tech companies or the society that cowards at its impressive might.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   We can just see where it goes. We can improv. We can riff.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I think we just did, actually.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   How much did that eat up?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Good 45 seconds.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We're on our way.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Perfect. We're well on our way.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Also with this, of course, Alex Lindsey from 090 090.media.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And it's so nice to not have me encumbered by facts and all we need is opinion.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So it's good at that.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Completely opinion driven.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Got that down today.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Renee Richie, who is, of course, always on the panel, is going to be a little late today.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He said he has some briefing by some company.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I don't know what that could be.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That's fine.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So we've apparently a briefing by some company that he has a very good type of relationship.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's more important to him that our relationship to our listeners.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So I apologize on behalf of the panel.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So the reason we are jesting today is because we are less than a week away from Apple's
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   WWDC keynote.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I want to just ask you, I want to say that I've scanned through it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Because Sundar Pichai decided to do it pretty much the same as you would do it if you had
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   a real audience.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   They had, of course, a limited socially distanced audience at the Google campus.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But he came on stage, and it was live.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   He threw it as some prerecorded video, but not much.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And it really, it fell flat, I thought.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.180]   You know, like we just, as a viewer, as viewers, I think we've moved past the live presentation.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.840]   And I don't think the people are going to be able to go back because it's just, it's so
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   slow.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   It's just so slow.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.000]   And it fell slow, didn't it?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Well, it did.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.160]   Well, the difference there is that this was a really developer-focused keynote.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.640]   It wasn't the zip boom bah that you get during an Apple thing where they're going to give
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.100]   you a flyby of the brand new Apple store.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.760]   And they're going to keep you on Tinder hooks by leading you on about the new Mac OS and
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.580]   tell you about the new phone.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.240]   This was a really sort of technical sort of thing.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.880]   And I think that the reason why it fell flat was A was nearly two hours long, but also
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.440]   that this is sort of like the worst of both worlds.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.880]   You have, when you have like a big, big audience in front of you, you can sort of build from
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.260]   the energy, from the live audience, if you've got a thousand people there to play in front
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.680]   of, but they decided to have it live, but to again, a socially distanced crowd of, you
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.360]   know, here we are in the middle of like a field in the campus and about maybe a dozen,
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.800]   two dozen people on lawn chairs spread out.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.920]   Now we're going to cut live to this other place where we've got maybe eight or nine
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.440]   people around and we're going to cut live to another place where there's no audience
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   whatsoever.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.240]   And every time you make one of those cuts, it really, whatever it is you're building up
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.840]   just kind of dissipates.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.540]   So I'm sure Alex is right and a lot of groups are now going to be thinking about, well,
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.560]   how much are we, what are we gaining by having a couple of 2000 hyper oxygenated, like Ellen
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.100]   Show audience people in front of our CEO?
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.020]   And what do we, what do we gain by being able to just really pre-record everything and make
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.540]   this as tight as possible?
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.300]   Well, and also I think that, you know, I think live events make a lot of sense.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.720]   I think that, you know, because they're very intimate and VIP level type things.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.740]   And I think that online events make a lot of sense because you can cut them, you can
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.060]   either cut them as close video or you can interact with the audience.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.740]   The hybrid is kind of, you know, if you think about your, your in person events as like
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.980]   a car and the virtual events is like a boat.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.100]   Hybrid is like a, is like an amphibious unit.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.900]   You know, it's not, it does both things, just none of them well.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.020]   So, so it just is kind of like, man, we're just going to make it horrible.
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.940]   You know, and so the thing is that it just comes down to like vehicular comparisons where
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.420]   the back is a truck, the iPad is a, is a, is a, is a, is a bus.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.660]   But, and I want to have a toaster in either room.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.740]   I think that the issue is, is that, is that the hybrid, as soon as you put a person into
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.180]   the audience, you put everybody watching it kind of on the outside and, and, and you've
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.740]   also slowed it down to that pace.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.540]   And so I think Apple's gotten really good at Apple and I think frame.io, you know, their
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.820]   last keynote has just really shown us that we don't really have to watch these live.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.780]   They're just, you know, you can really make it exciting and much more interesting just
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.020]   to make it a show, just a one hour show.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.900]   But I do think that they want you to watch live because I think they want to get the news,
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.820]   you know, the headline breaking news out of it.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.500]   Streaming it live still makes sense because you're sinking the whole audience.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.100]   Everyone finds out about it at the same time.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.500]   Everyone tweets about it at the same time.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.980]   So the streaming part live makes sense.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.780]   It's just that it doesn't necessarily make sense to present it.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.940]   If you want to present your story, it doesn't make sense to necessarily do that live.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.940]   Good.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.140]   So it's interesting because in between Google I/O and WWDC, there was also Microsoft Build
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.260]   Conference, their developers conference, and they chose to do what Google did in the past.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.780]   They've used build for other purposes.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.740]   But this time it was really, in fact, so I'm sorry, Satya Nadella came on and basically
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.460]   read a synopsis of what's going to up the show and left.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.540]   He didn't even set the stage, didn't do it much at all.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.620]   And they certainly didn't announce any products.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.020]   So maybe this is a trend that developer conferences will be more developer focused.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.860]   Apple really, though, likes to use these big stages to at least announce some products.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.620]   We're going to do, so since it's a Monday and we don't have anything else on the schedule,
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.860]   I think what we're going to do is start with the public announcement, which is really a
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.860]   product announcement.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.780]   It's much less for developers and much more for press and the public.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.900]   But then there's the State of the Union for developers that afternoon.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.660]   I think we might stream that as well.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.500]   Just because I think that that's going to be the developer part.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.340]   And Apple really is making that clear distinction.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.180]   And then we're office hours is going to do our own thing.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.900]   But what do you do?
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.980]   So we're pulling together some developers.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.460]   Renee is going to join me and we're going to pull together some developers.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.100]   So we've got a couple really hard core Mac developers that we're going to, or Apple,
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.420]   iOS, everything that are going to, we're just going to take, we're going to do the kind
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.340]   of the office hours style where we bring some developers together.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.420]   We have a lot of people ask questions.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.220]   People can sign up at, you can sign up for office hours or you can go to officehours.global.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.260]   A very simple website at the moment.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.500]   And you can sign up there to find out more about that specifically.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.820]   But yeah, we're going to cover it.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.580]   We want some time to think about it.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.300]   And we also just going to be all Q&A.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.540]   So the viewers can ask questions and we'll relay them and talk about them a little bit
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.020]   with the developers themselves.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   That's what they think.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   What time is next?
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.020]   Like that's going to be.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   That's going to be at six o'clock.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.220]   Six PM East Pacific.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.020]   And in grand office hours style, there'll be an hour or five to six where it's just the
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.700]   panel, like a whole bunch of us just all talking about stuff.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.340]   I'm not necessarily that.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.820]   And then at six o'clock, we'll switch over.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.740]   So six to eight, we'll talk about it.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.980]   And it's just going to be an evening discussion.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.620]   We'll do it on Monday and Thursday.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.780]   So Monday's really about what happens on Monday and Thursday's about what happened the
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.300]   rest of the week of what we saw and anything that we thought was really interesting.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   But again, we're going to pull these developers together.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.580]   And I feel like I want to hear from them as to what they think, but also give possibly
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.900]   a lot of other developers the opportunity to ask questions.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.060]   And so it's a much more, again, what we do in office hours, which is just Q&A.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.580]   So anyway, so it's going to be a slightly different thing than I've ever done before.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.420]   And so we're pretty excited about it.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.020]   Well, thank you for not doing it the same time as us.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.820]   Yeah, no, I like to say.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.380]   No, I specifically wanted to get it out of the way so that you're doing what you're doing.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.380]   Thank you.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.300]   And we're going to hope that everybody who listens to our coverage will then, because
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.140]   that's exactly the kind of thing I'd like to hear is now what developers think of, well,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.380]   at least what they've learned so far.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.900]   It's a multi-day event, right?
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.900]   I mean, it's not.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.420]   We're restructuring all of office hours for Monday.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.060]   So if you want to watch us do it, you can watch us live today.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.060]   We just watch, oh, that didn't work.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.300]   You know, there's a whole bunch of like, because we're rebuilding it so that it can be, you
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.100]   know, super sources and you know, all the things that we would normally do.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.740]   So we're having fun.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.740]   That's really cool.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.540]   The next couple of days, or you can watch me fail in front of lots of people.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.540]   It's kind of fun.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.820]   And I'm glad you set it up, set up a website because that makes it a little easier for
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.220]   people to figure out what's going on.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.740]   This is the direction that we're going.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.340]   So this is not just for this event.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.820]   This will be, you know, it'll be a place where you can, you can, it is just for this
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.660]   event right now, but we'll keep on adding more and people will be able to view the shows
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.900]   there in the next, you know, relatively soon.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.820]   There's, there's Renee.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.060]   Who's there?
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.380]   Yeah, that's, it was a long story.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.460]   I'm talking about that right now.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.460]   Okay.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.540]   Those are other people.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.220]   But then you may Office Hours dot Global for more information and you can enter your
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.220]   email there.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.580]   That's a good idea to have just one central place people can figure out what's going
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   on.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.980]   So how should we do this?
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.020]   Should we talk about, yeah, let's, let's, I guess Renee is going to join us in a few
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.100]   minutes and I maybe we'll, maybe we'll just do a few news stories.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.200]   And then when Renee joins us, we can get predictions for Monday because I think there
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:27.980]   will be a lot of predictions, a lot of things that we want to talk about.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:33.860]   There are some, there is some actual news, Bloomberg covering apples.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.780]   Actually, this really comes from an Apple press release.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:47.300]   Their annual supply chain responsibility report, which comes out annually, I would guess, they
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.000]   said there were, there was a reduction of major violations of its code of conduct and
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   no cases of child labor.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.760]   But you wouldn't think it's interesting that in this day and age a company has to put out
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.040]   a report yearly that says, Hey, good news is you're no child labor in the making of
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.600]   our products.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   But that is good.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.380]   The, the news item there is that Apple is being absolutely diligent in trying to ferret
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.120]   out violations of their cozy conduct when you have so many manufacturers that hide behind
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.120]   it.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.720]   It's easy to hide behind layers of subcontractors in China to say that, Oh, well gosh, we,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.300]   you know, they were, they were, they were not supposed to use those hiring practices
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.540]   because we have it in our contract.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.040]   You're not supposed to do that.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.880]   They don't ask what happens when they're everybody's, they move up a deadline and suddenly
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.140]   they fact, we find some of the 2,500 people to work on their product.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.500]   But the, they're, they're, they wag their finger when they're, when they're caught.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.180]   This is why Apple, they, they really put their, put their neck out there.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.080]   And that's why they have the, a reputation that not many tech companies have in manufacturing.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.800]   This is the 2021 annual progress report, people and environment in our supply chain.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.560]   And it kicks off with a quote from Tim Cook, Apple is a technology company, but we never
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.840]   forget that the devices we make are imagined by human minds built by human hands and are
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.040]   meant to improve human lives.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.160]   And so they're paying attention to everything from, you know, the quality of life for the
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.700]   workers to the use of lithium and health and safety.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:23.020]   They talked about COVID-19, environmental strategies, building a carbon's neutral supply
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.120]   chain and things like that.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.640]   It is a, it is a, it is a big operation, 470 plus labor agencies mapped across 10 higher
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.600]   risk countries.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:41.400]   That's a huge number to keep track of 254,265 supplier employees.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.120]   There were directly engaged about their workplace experiences.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.120]   I don't know if that means a survey or whatever.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.680]   21 and a half million supplier employees trained on their rights since 2008.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.040]   So Apple's being very aggressive in this.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:04.480]   You know, I've always suspect corporate public relations, shilling and stuff like this.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.000]   And I'm sure there's a certain amount of that, but at least Apple's doing the work and talking
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.160]   about it, which I think is important.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   41 billion gallons of fresh water saved since 2013, 900,000 plus annualized metric tons of
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.640]   carbon equivalent avoided in the fiscal year 2020.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.120]   You know, and the other thing that we should point out is that although Apple's not alone
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.240]   in making these claims about what we were talking about, Google's keynote at Google
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.720]   they owe when they're when they're big sweeping things was, Hey, we're making a pledge by
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.920]   2013 to be 24, 7, 100% carbon neutral sources of electricity.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.560]   And the thing is when Apple makes that claim, they're not an AI based company.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.840]   They do AI, but Google has to basically explain how it's not necessarily altruistic.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's the fact that they are burning up so much energy with all of their artificial intelligence
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.760]   stuff that number one, they need to create their own sources of energy to make sure that
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.560]   they can reliably tap into what they need to tap into.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.640]   And as for the rest, it's kind of like a chemical plant saying that, and we're pledging
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.440]   not to actually dump things directly into the water from now on.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.480]   I mean, they're they're they're pledging not to screw things up as badly as they could,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.520]   which is again, fair play to them.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.480]   But it's not this it's amazing that they make this big statement about how if only Gaia
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.680]   is crying, ladies and gentlemen, and if only all companies could be like, I was like, no,
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   again, you just realize that there's so many.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.200]   If there are seven major environmental impacts you're making by investing so heavily in
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.720]   AI, you've mitigated three of them for them, but you still got three really, really big
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.240]   problems that are almost unaddressable and oh well.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.920]   It's interesting because when I look at the values that Apple's promoting, they're really
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.760]   American values.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.120]   And I think a lot of people pointed out you can't project American values on a workforce
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.320]   in India or China because they have different values.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.840]   But on the other hand, if you're going to promote a liberal Western agenda, this is
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.680]   a good one to promote, you know, limited working hours, prevention of involuntary labor.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.720]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.160]   Underage labor prevent that.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160]   That's good.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.000]   That's a really big deal in China too.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   So they have to.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.040]   The same time Apple doesn't, you know, they kind of don't mention the fact that they make
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.080]   a product that is essentially unrepairable that ends up in landfill.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.040]   I mean, there are certainly issues.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.200]   I mean, I'm glad Apple's, I guess what I'm saying is I'm glad Apple's doing this.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.480]   It's really important that they do.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.840]   And I think that the values that they're promoting and the things they're trying to get done
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.360]   are very, very important.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.560]   But at the same time, they're not perfect.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.400]   Oh no one ever will be.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   I'll tell you why.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.040]   I feel guilty because we're, you know, in effect, we promote the notion that you've got
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.600]   to get a new iPhone every year.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.960]   You know, we really promote that kind of feeling.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.880]   And I don't know if that's the right way to treat the planet.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.080]   I think that at least on this show where the four of us are always talking about who is
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   this upgrade for?
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.320]   It's not so much people.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.520]   We can't help getting people excited if they really want to buy a new iPhone every year.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.000]   But I think most of the time our conversation is about like, here's, if this is a great
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.960]   upgrade, if you've, if your last iPhone was two or three years old, this is a good one
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.360]   if your iPad is long in the tooth and you're looking, you're waiting for something revolutionary.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.640]   But yeah, that's, that's absolutely right.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:40.360]   I think that it's really important to, especially, I really think that one of the things that
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:47.160]   I sort of talked to myself about a bunch of years ago was don't make people want things.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.320]   Get people, get people interested in things, get people to understand like what's the significance
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.520]   of something, even if they don't necessarily want to buy it just as they stay aware.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.960]   But yeah, your job is not to make people want things.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   And we should also promote repairability.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.800]   Apple has not been good on that.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.360]   In fact, they've been fighting against that in some respects.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.480]   The right to, right to repair promote recycling.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.680]   And Apple does, I think, do a fairly good job.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   At least makes the right noises about promoting recycling with Liam, Liam, their robot and
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.160]   things like that.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.760]   And just encourage people not to buy more stuff than they need.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.560]   I mean, I think that the hard part is that you start pulling at that thread.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.280]   And that whole swatter of almost everything we buy comes apart pretty quickly.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.280]   That's really true.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.640]   So we just have to, we have to kind of always, it's the world we like.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.280]   You know, I think I tweeted out a couple of days ago, you know, I started buying honey
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.360]   from a guy inside of the road in Bodega Bay.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.160]   And he's just got this truck and you buy this honey.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.040]   And I suddenly realized I've been, I've been putting cardboard on my, on my, what was
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   called honey.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.440]   I mean, it was actually liquefied.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.720]   Well, good honey is so prepared to, yeah, compared to what I was doing.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.360]   And you start really realizing as you change, if you think about food supply, if you think
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.480]   about how that you're, you know, gas or anything else or how, how food gets to you or how all
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.160]   these things happen, they're incredibly wasteful and damaging.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.400]   And so we just have to make sure that we're clear that there, like we can, we definitely
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.600]   need to hold Apple to a higher standard, but we have to realize that in the context of
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:16.800]   the entire world that we, we damage it by, by being living, you know, and so, so the,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.520]   so we just have to also understand that we have to kind of keep those things in perspective
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   as we completely agree.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.480]   I think it's easy to get absolute, absoluteest about the process.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.200]   And we need to do the best we can.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.160]   And I'd ask Apple to do that.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.320]   Here's the guy you buy honey from the side of the road on.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   So great.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.840]   And what comes with the honey, like he, he makes these little labels that he, that it
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   takes too long.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.240]   So I just said, just write this stuff on the top because this will take a half an hour
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.640]   otherwise because he's selling them.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.760]   And then he uses one of the little glue sticks and he puts it on the, on the outside of it.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.240]   And, but it comes with a story about where the honey came from and the guy that he talked
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.520]   about it and how he worked on it.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   And it's amazing.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   So good honey.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.800]   But it's, and there's all those are three very, very different honeys from different parts
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.400]   of the, you know, about the west, the west coast, you know, and I got to hear about the
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.560]   great honey crisis right now that they're running out of honey.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   That's right.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.400]   Renee Richie's going to join us is done with his phone call.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:17.440]   Come back more news such as it is for the week and we're going to start speculating about
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.880]   what's coming less than a week from today.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.560]   But don't, don't start, let's not, the three of us start intentionally bringing up possible
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.200]   pieces of hardware just to see what makes Renee stop saying anything.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.320]   What's that would be mean and unfair and funny and entertaining, but just tug your ear.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   That's all we had.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.080]   Renee wouldn't, Renee would hold it home to have some glasses.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.120]   I want to take a break and then we'll come back.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.720]   Renee Richie coming up in our projections for WWDC right after this.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.560]   This podcast is supported by AT&T active armor.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.600]   Right now our lives are on our phones and with our phones full of live streamed exercise,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.720]   classes, midday work calls and nightly family video calls, there is no room for fraud calls.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:12.120]   Thankfully, AT&T makes customer security a priority helping block those pesky calls.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.600]   It's not complicated.

[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:37.400]   Following that threat of your honey guy, David Prager, our good friend from Tech TV, said,
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.720]   "You know, I used to buy a honey from a guy who used to work sitting next to Steve Jobs
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:50.000]   at Next some years ago and he says, "Come to think of it based on parent this all up.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.360]   I think they may know each other."
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   They probably know each other.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.040]   It's a small world that artisanal honey seller world is small, small, small.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.840]   Renee Richie joins us of course from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, our Apple expert.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.800]   And I have to say Renee's going to be on the Sunday after WWDC.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.960]   So we'll find out what he found out today.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.120]   Were you on a briefing with the fruit company?
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   I just want to point out that the one time all of you are here on time is the one time
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   time plate.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   We knew you were going to be late.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   I was sure.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.800]   We were talking about the opera or that Alex didn't talk about the volume or something.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.360]   Now let's talk about what you're doing.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   I'd slide right in.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   We've been kind of stalling.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   That was very, very funny.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   That was a very, very funny comment.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   Now answer the damn question.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   And he's been watching "Lide of Me" again.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   Did you, can I?
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.400]   All right, I'm not going to press you.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.880]   That's okay.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   That's okay.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:58.480]   So, WWDC, 10 AM, this coming Monday, six days away.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.320]   We will see.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.920]   Renee, do you know anything?
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.640]   I think this is like super safe bets.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:14.160]   Like iOS 15, iPadOS 15, TVOS 15, Apple Watch OS, or Watch OS 8, the audio OS is, I think
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.080]   all that software stuff is the safest bet in technology at this point.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.240]   Yeah, we know that because that's what they do at WWDC.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   We don't care.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Greg's got to be superman.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.320]   He's got to do a superman's stint once a year.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.480]   We don't care.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   We care about hardware.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.440]   And you know, again, I have mixed feelings about this.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.120]   I mentioned it when it happened.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.000]   A big Apple supplier, Quanta, was hit by ransomware, the ransomware guys, as they often do instead
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.760]   of merely encrypting data, also stole data from Quanta and started to release it online.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.480]   It suddenly stopped, which makes me think either Apple or Quanta said, yeah, maybe we'll
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.960]   give you some money instead of letting, you know, this black.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.840]   They either sent the money or they sent the former, former operators.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.240]   Something the most.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:08.680]   But the two things that were released were schematics for a 16 inch and a 14 inch MacBook
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.400]   Pro, which makes sense.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.360]   Quanta is known to make laptops for a lot of companies, including Apple.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.360]   It seems reasonable.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.760]   I mean, it seems like a reasonable thing to do.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.720]   New design featuring a MagSafe connector, I think.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.880]   Yes, you'll be happy about that, Alex.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.640]   I'm so excited.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.880]   Actually, that's very credible because we've seen now the MagSafe on the new iMacs.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:38.200]   So I would bet that that design feature will go forward throughout the line.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   A car.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.320]   I found this a little harder to believe.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.800]   A SD card reader.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.200]   That's like going to do it, Leo.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   They're going to do it.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.560]   And it's going to be nerd fan service.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.600]   It's going to be because so many people on Twitter complained about the lack of HDMI
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.760]   and SD cards, and they feel like they've got to make it up to us.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.240]   And now the minute it happens, there are going to be a bunch of nerds complaining about
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.560]   the lack of four ports anymore.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.840]   Like why do I have to have a static HDMI port or an S2?
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.560]   Why are you choosing my ports for me?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.120]   It's going to be a bloodbath.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.360]   Andy and I would like to know when we're getting our ethernet.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.760]   We want to use an extra $80.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.360]   That's still there.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   That's still there.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:25.320]   No, I've seen the chromatics of everyone else's scene or at least the CNC for the turnaround
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.480]   is for that device.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.800]   And it really does look like sometimes the best way to go forward is to go back.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:39.600]   And 2016, I thought that the MacBook Pro was a real gamble.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.360]   They were with the I with the first I'm at Apple took a hell of a gamble that this is
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.440]   the this is the future of computing.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.360]   People are going to be complaining right now, but this is exactly where everybody's going
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   to be.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.640]   They're going to be right in step with us a year, year and a half from now.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.840]   I feel as though they took the exact same sort of gamble in 2016 and they lost.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.080]   And I feel as though the the schematics that we had been seeing a couple weeks ago in that
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:07.040]   leak kind of underscore that, okay, I guess that we do need if you are if you're using
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   this as if we're really calling this a Macbook Pro.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.560]   There are things that are traveling professional really, really wants to have.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.720]   And that's not a bag full of dongles.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.480]   And the best the best way we can take advantage of that is by maybe figuring out how to put
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.920]   an SD card reader in there and maybe figuring out how to put an HDMI port in there.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   They wouldn't be they wouldn't be out of step with the rest of the notebook industry, the
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.400]   high notebook industry by not having a an ethernet port in there.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.080]   But other things there are very few there are very few reasons that Apple can come up with.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.400]   I'm still pretty frosty about no headphone jack on my iPad Pro.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.760]   God, it makes me mad.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:51.320]   Actually, I brought a pair of AirPod Pro Max headphones just because I got the new.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.240]   I figured I spent so much money on the new iPad Pro.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   I spent some more.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.320]   Yeah, it's a lost cost fallacy.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.080]   A sunk cost fallacy, sorry.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.960]   Yeah, it's a fallacy, but I did it.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.800]   So yeah, because I can I ask you this also because I thought after we talked about it
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.680]   so extensively, I should probably try spatial audio as well.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.960]   Here's my question though about the ports because, you know, like I've never had a dongle
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   free life.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:21.040]   I went from Firewire 400 to 800 to VGA to mini display to dual link display to Thunderbolt
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.960]   two to display port mini display port Thunderbolt three.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.280]   I just had my entire life has been dongles and I know I'm going to have to use dongles
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.000]   with this computer because I'm not using SD cards anymore.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.440]   I'm using CF express cards and I feel like this this caters to the fat middle of the segment
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.040]   where you have like a lot of prosumers who still use.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.000]   I'm not even sure like do they use cameras anymore?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.600]   Do they just use their iPhones?
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   Are they going to HDMI out?
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.280]   Are they going to be upset in two years that there's a new standard and they have to use
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.720]   a dongle and HDMI and SD don't take dongles.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.760]   They only have like two or three lightning ports now instead of the four they used to
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.680]   have or plugging in on both sides instead of being stuck on one MagSafe.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.480]   I have to admit that I'm the MagSafe thing is really important to me because well here's
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.680]   the funny thing is it's not as important to me anymore because I don't travel all the
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   time.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   In fact, I travel very little.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.320]   So now I don't really care nearly as much.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.600]   The reason that I cared about it was because my computer was often on my lap in an airport
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.360]   and I wanted to make sure that if it didn't get bent and so I just constantly worried
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   about it.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.520]   At this point, I have to admit that I'd rather have to use the USB-T.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.680]   I'd rather have the Thunderbolt than the HDMI.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.360]   No, no, no, no, no, because I'd rather have to make sure that I get my ports.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.520]   Now I would I still would like to have a MagSafe.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.600]   It's just that my I have to admit now my portable like what I take outside is my iPad.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   You know, it's not my it's in so my laptop.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.160]   In fact, you know, my laptops, I have an iMac here in front of me and I have my iPad
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.880]   and my laptops just kind of get moved around every once in a while and I don't use them
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.560]   nearly as much, you know, as I used to.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.600]   And so again, my iPad is really filling in most of what I was doing on my laptop.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.320]   And so and again, it's because I don't travel as much anymore.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.200]   So there'll be other people that need that, but it's a different lifestyle.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:03.080]   But but I think that I am thinking if I lose one of the USB-C ports to HDMI, I will go.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.440]   I wish I had my USB or not USB-C, but Thunderbolt.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.800]   You know, the Thunderbolt are valuable to me now.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.960]   You know, and what I do is I split them out when I go out to H when I go to HDMI, I have
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:20.560]   an HDMI and I have a USB and I have a USB-C, you know, like a USB-A USB-C in any adapter
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.880]   that I use in there.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.400]   So I'm splitting it out to a bunch of things every time I connect it to the computer except
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   for power.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:33.320]   Yeah, but the conventional user is likely especially if they're spending $1,500 on a
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.280]   laptop, that's also going to be like their main acts for everything.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   And these are the people that this is every conference room has an HDMI connector in it
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   right now.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.960]   When I give when I moderate panels and do interviews like at Comic-Cons, the one thing
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.520]   I can count on on that podium is an HDMI connector.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.560]   So HDMI is a really, really safe.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.040]   Well, what I find is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.080]   you can bring a you I mean to be fair you can bring an adapter with you.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.240]   Well, in most in most in most conference rooms that I go into now like you could bring
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.080]   whatever you want, you know, but I would have you my bad.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.520]   I would have you have an adapter.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.360]   I mean, I'm saying that at what point do you does the manufacturer should say that, hey,
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.920]   look, I got your back here.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.360]   I want that's an inconvenience.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.040]   This is something you're very, very likely to want to use.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.120]   So we decided to actually put that in there.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.480]   We don't have a we.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.160]   It's I don't know call the 80% rule.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.080]   I think I sometimes I think of it as the take a look at what all the best selling laptop
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:39.240]   lines in the Windows world are like rule because those these are the laptops that are competing
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   with dozens and dozens of other models when you see that when you see the table stakes
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:52.880]   for Windows laptop is HDMI multiple at least one USB three USB a type port a couple of
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.520]   the features like that.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.600]   Then you sort of get the idea that this is what this is what the majority of people are
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.040]   finding to be compelling reasons to buy model A instead of model B competitors model instead
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   of your own.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.680]   There's a price to pay for that PC laptops that have all that stuff are thick and clunky
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   in order to have all those.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.840]   Well, we're not not so much.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.840]   Well, not so much.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.480]   I mean, there when you talk me talk about thick and clunky, you often talk about like
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.200]   something along the lines of a MacBook Air only instead of being razor thin at the leading
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   edge.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.320]   It's actually the same the same size.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.800]   This is why I feel as though we kind of have to give up have Apple ever making a laptop
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.000]   that has an ethernet port built into it because Apple is not interested in making a chassis
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.240]   that's that thick that thick enough to accept that kind of that kind of a connector.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.280]   However, again, on the PC side of the PC side, you can buy ones that are that thick and they're
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.600]   not necessarily for a lot of people.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.960]   The idea of being able to simply plug straight in, not have to go through an immediate step
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.440]   of dumping out a bag full of dongles and picking up the one that's that's correct for
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.520]   you for a lot of people.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   That's a good investment.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   Who's the HP spec?
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.400]   Who's the HP spec?
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.080]   He's the HP Spectre X360, which is kind of like a MacBook.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.040]   It's got one type C on that side.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.400]   Two type C's on this because they have a little beveled angle on there, which is awful.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.880]   That's for the charger.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.360]   But this is a very pretty thin and light laptop.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.120]   This is very typical.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.800]   And it's similar to a MacBook Air.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.160]   So the LG Gram, right?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.800]   The LG Gram, I think, is the Gram.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.000]   Does the Gram have an HDMI port?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.640]   I think I only have a screen at this point.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.120]   I think what I'm interested in is the future of the laptop at all.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:45.760]   I think that the issue is that, again, when I just look at my own behavior, I take my
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   iPad out now.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:54.040]   If iPads could run an M1 iPad, not run Mac OS, but could open Mac programs, I'd probably
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.720]   never take my laptop out of the house again.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.480]   Like literally we're that close to if I just could open up the handful of Mac apps that
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   I need and I could get video in to the USB-C or whatever.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.600]   Actually, the Gram does have an HDMI port on it.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.680]   It's thin and light as that is.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.640]   So your point is well made.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   There's the HDMI port.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.520]   It's got actually a pretty good complement of those ports.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.920]   They're not mini HDMI or mini Ethernet.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.760]   I have mini HDMI on some of my camera now.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.920]   Ethernet is so disappeared.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   I think that's because it's so big.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   You can't make that smaller.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.680]   Well, I'm wondering, why did they never make mini Ethernet?
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.560]   Is it because everyone in enterprise would murder them?
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.880]   Lenovo makes a mini Ethernet.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.720]   You have to buy a dedicated Lenovo mini Ethernet adapter.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.080]   Well, that's amazing.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   That's different.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.480]   On a lot of Lenovo laptops, you can get one.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:47.320]   I have a Lenovo X1 that has an Ethernet port built in, I think, but also if you want that
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.400]   that goes in through the USB bus.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.960]   However, if you want one that goes directly into the USB-C.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.560]   Look at your X1 anyway.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   I don't think it does.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.720]   I think it has that mini Ethernet on it.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.640]   No, no, I'm saying I look at the USB.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.360]   I understand what you're saying.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.120]   Also, another reason behind that was that for reasons that I'd have to look it up again
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.880]   to remember it, apparently there are some security concerns at some corporations about
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:22.320]   having an internal USB bus type controller that could be subject to tampering.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:30.800]   Lenovo, which is probably the last company to really put a lot of ports on there stuff.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   But they have an...
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   I think that DNA.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   But I think you're right.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   C secure is all...
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.280]   It's a business device.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.320]   I carry this dongle with me.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320]   I wish it were thunder.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   I don't think it's thunderbolt.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   It's a hell of a dongle, sir.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   It's the pluggable.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   It's got ethernet.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.120]   It's got HDMI.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.120]   It's got mini...
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   Full on dangle.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.120]   It's a dangle dongle.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.920]   It even has a power in through that little type of seat.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.480]   But then, because it doesn't have a headphone port, I also have to carry this dongle.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.440]   This is for the iPad, obviously, not the laptop.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.920]   It's a DAC so that I can listen to music.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920]   And also...
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.640]   But also, the one that I have...
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.440]   The one that I have cost about $50, $60, because it has basically all the ports that I would
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.440]   basically need.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.440]   Right.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.800]   And think about that as a hidden cost of the device.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.280]   I'm not saying necessarily that Apple is wrong for not doing this and damn them for doing
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   this.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.360]   On to their absolute credit, they say...
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.000]   They make people like me happy and they make people like Alex happy by saying we are not
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.680]   instead of going the Windows laptop route by saying that, "Okay, well, we're going to
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.280]   give you two USB 3 type A's.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.120]   One USB-C, but it's low, low speed.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   One of them."
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.880]   And we put a little ring around us to make sure what it is.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.920]   That's actually thunderbolt capable in DisplayPort.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.320]   They're saying, "No, Apple's saying we will give you four top line.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.440]   A type line for accessories and you can do with them what you wish."
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.760]   Which is a nice thing.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.160]   The difference is that, again, as usual with Windows, you can choose to have the hardware
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   that you want.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.600]   Whereas with Apple, you are stuck with whatever decisions that they make for you.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.880]   That's because there's a thousand Windows manufacturers.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   There's only one...
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.880]   Right.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   No, exactly.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   That's why it hurts.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   When they decide to say, "You know what?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.280]   We're going to have a brand new keyboard with .52 millimeters of travel and all across
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.000]   the entire laptop line.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   You have no choice.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   You're welcome."
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   You're like, "Okay, great.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   You just screwed everybody.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.160]   We don't have a choice anymore.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:43.320]   If you want a portable Mac comes with an absolute crap garbage keyboard."
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.960]   So this is the sort of stuff that you give up.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.840]   I think you get better value than what a lot of people claim that you do with an Apple
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.120]   product because they don't make garbage.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.040]   However that does mean that if this is not a Burger King hamburger, you can't get it
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040]   your way.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.840]   I guess he's only slightly less angry than Andy about the keyboard slightly.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.560]   I guess the thing that is going to be the top line though on your...
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.480]   There's yet to be a proper reckoning.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.760]   This I swear there will be a reckoning properly.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   The top line...
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.760]   Sorry.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.200]   He tasks me and I shall have him.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.480]   The top line of this will be a new...
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.320]   Possibly a new Apple Silicon chip.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.120]   If they're going to release new laptops, then it stands to reason they're not going to be
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.960]   another M1 based, but it's 16 inches and 14 inches.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.240]   This will be something new.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   Yes.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.160]   I have one X.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   Is it going to be X?
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.680]   Is that where they're going to call it or M2?
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   What are they going to call it?
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.680]   Not that it matters.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.080]   You're getting really confused about it because traditionally Apple uses the number to represent
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.240]   the Silicon generation.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.920]   So you get like A12, A13, A14.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:58.040]   And they released the A12Z after the A13 just because they needed something wider instead
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.160]   of higher for the iPad Pro.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.000]   If they followed a pattern, an Apple does until they doesn't.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.200]   There's always a chance they're going to change their minds.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.640]   The M1 was the base for this generation the same way the A14 was.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.040]   Those are the same 11th generation Apple Silicon.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:21.120]   Then the M1 is like an A14X and the M1X would be extra, extra cores, extra, extra memory.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   That sort of thing.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.080]   The interesting thing for me is the rebalancing because they have four efficiency and four
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.160]   performance cores in M1.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.400]   And the rumors they'll have two efficiency and eight performance cores in the M1X along
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.000]   with an option for 16 or 32 graphics cores.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.520]   And that's a lot more power draw than we had in the M1 versions.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.160]   So seeing how they balance that out with active cooling systems and batteries, I think
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   it'll be interesting.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   But I don't think we'll see M2 until we get the A15.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   And then that'll be low power.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.920]   And that'll go into the next generation MacBook Air and computers like that.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.240]   Ultra low power computers.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.000]   So if people who, I guess anybody who uses the 16 inch today with perhaps as much as
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.760]   an I-9 in it, this is going to be the replacement for that.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.880]   This is the power tool for the Pro.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   The highest.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   So much less heat.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   Highest speed.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.880]   No, that's not it.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.920]   Although if it looks like this, then I think people would be.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   It's stunned.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.880]   I think if you had a Pro, I mean, I keep on wanting Apple to really do a Pro Pro.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.480]   You know, like a real Pro.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.080]   We're not worried about it being thin.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.800]   We're going to give you a bunch of connectors.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.840]   We're going to give you a ton of power.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.040]   And it's just all about performance.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.920]   So far we still get kind of in this in between of when we have to make it thin.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.080]   And it's not really a beefy laptop.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.800]   You know, that's what we'll see.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.000]   So redesigned chassis it looked like.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.240]   Obviously you have to put those HDMI ports somewhere.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.440]   New processor.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   Here's a question.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:03.800]   Not by the way, now that I have the new iPad with the mini LED screen, I have to say I
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   barely knows.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.880]   I mean, you'd have to put side by side with the old one and really be looking.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.360]   You have to be in HDR mode.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.880]   It's a separate mode, basically.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.320]   So otherwise it looks the same.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.120]   When is it in HDR mode when I'm watching HDR video?
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.800]   So it's 600 nits almost all the time.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.320]   And then if it plays anything that's Dolby Vision or HDR, any of that kind of content.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.600]   I'm not talking just about brightness.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.640]   I'm also talking about quality, right?
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.360]   I mean, let's face it.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.840]   That's the old screens are fine.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.440]   That's the quality thing with this.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.240]   This the only boost it's really doing is to be able to show you the contrast ratio and
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.000]   peak bright color gammas is saying and all that stuff is the same.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Yeah, P3.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.080]   OK.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.280]   So then does it matter if there's a mini LED display in these new laptops?
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.760]   It does because it's yeah, you'll get the higher contrast ratio.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.120]   And for people like Alex and me and increasingly Andy because we're totally subverting him
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.760]   into this whole business and probably you too, like if you want to start mastering an
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   HDR, if YouTube starts making really good HDR implementations, no, no, you know, Alex
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.680]   is going to broadcast Mac break and 16 K HDR, you know, XDR at some point.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.680]   We're targeting.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.200]   I mean, to be specific, we're targeting.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:15.160]   It goes to HDR by September, really, wow.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   So HDR, but can they and will they be able to supply the mini LED screens for this, especially
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   16 inches?
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.160]   There have been yield, there have been yield issues, right?
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   And some are saying it's pushed off.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.120]   And also, are they going to change the refresh rate because right now you have to manually
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:38.320]   toggle between 48 and 60 hertz for 24 frames per second or 30 frames per second video editing,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.960]   which is nice, but it sure would be nicer if it did what the iPad Pro does.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.680]   And that's have adaptive refresh rate that automatically goes from 120 to 24 hertz, you
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.680]   know, as needed.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   Right.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.720]   I'd be really surprised by the end of the year, I'd be really surprised if Apple's selling
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.280]   anything under 120, but that isn't capable of 120 frames per second.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.040]   Will it do this true motion thing where it scales up and down or will just stay with
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.480]   existing content, but I think that more it's setting the stage to deliver content at 120
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   frames a second.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.440]   So it's going to, I mean, that what we think of is, oh, it looks like soap opera or whatever.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.520]   It's because it's building frames in between.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.720]   And of course, that's going to look soft and weird and it's motion blurry.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.480]   But when you look at 120 frame playing back, it's at on a display that can do it.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.000]   It's pretty nifty.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:39.800]   So a better display, nice, new chassis with extra ports, an M1X or some or the like.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:44.200]   How much RAM will be able to go up to 32 64 32 or 64?
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   I'm serious.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.120]   If Apple's going to keep the differentiation they have now where the 14 inch goes to 32
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.880]   and we'll have 16 cores, 32 gigabytes of RAM top level and four terabytes.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:00.560]   And then the 16 inch will have 32 cores, 64 gigabytes of RAM and terabytes or if they'll
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   let us 12,000 dollars.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.520]   That's what the Intel model comes like.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.600]   The Intel models are staggered.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.720]   The bigger one has the higher potential and that feels artificial.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.280]   Like an Intel was famous.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.040]   I think with Intel, you do it because of cooling issues.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   You want a bigger chassis.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.320]   So you have more chance to cool that thing off.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   That's the problem.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.160]   So Intel would stick the screwdriver in and monkey with the chip so they could break a
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.480]   few things and charge you, you know, charge you more for the ones that weren't broken.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:31.840]   So, I guess, I mean, this is all purely speculative unless Apple's told anybody anything.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.840]   I guess not.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   Charles knows.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   Charles knows everything.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.480]   I'm just, you know, what I'm really lining up is what we should be looking for on Monday.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.360]   You know, what, what, what the bingo card looks like with the checkboxes.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.280]   How much expectation will debt we can build up?
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.160]   How disappointed we can make people after they don't put in 32 64.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.680]   It's going to mint mint Bitcoin with no power draws.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.080]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.760]   I'd love to.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.920]   The thing that I'm sort of hanging my my expectations on are really expectations for
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.200]   iPadOS that this is there's every single time Apple comes out with a device that seems
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:13.640]   curiously and suspiciously overpowered for the tasks that people demand of it.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.280]   I start looking ahead to, okay, what is Apple doing next year that is going to require this
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.960]   kind of horsepower.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.160]   And consistently all the reviews of the iPad.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.960]   So iPad pro so far.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:31.560]   And I agree with much, if not, but not necessarily all of them is that once you once Apple makes
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:37.960]   iPadOS a much more multitasking, multi operation friendly operating system, once they fix a
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.560]   few pain points that have been persistent for years and years.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:47.120]   Oh boy, is this going to be is this going to absolutely totally justify the $1,000, $1,300
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.080]   expense of what you put into it?
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.800]   And this is it would be a shame if if if Apple put if Apple did what they've done with the
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.640]   with the iPad, given it Thunderbolt, given it this the same one processor that opens up
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.120]   so many possibilities.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.640]   And all they did was okay.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:11.720]   So if I'm using procreate filters, now they run about 25% faster as they did before, and
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.360]   it's easier to use a Thunderbolt style dock and have high speed connection to a monitor
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   and stuff like that.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.080]   So it would be a shame if all it was was an iPad, but more so.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.720]   I've one of the reasons why I bought I bought one risk because I really do feel as though
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   this is Apple is going to make a big, big leap forward sometime in the next year.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.360]   And that's why that's why I'm hoping we get to see a big, big roadmap sort of sense of
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.480]   announcements with the next version of iPadOS.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.400]   Yeah, there are some naysayers though.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.240]   There are some naysayers saying that Apple just put the M1 in because it was cheaper than
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.840]   spinning and taping up a separate eight, a 14 X chip that wouldn't have all the same
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.720]   stuff in it, but would have just what it needed.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.520]   And this was just a cost saving measure.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.920]   So I'm not in that camp.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.440]   I just wanted to give the gates of people to get their hopes up.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.720]   There is a school of thought that it was just cheaper than making a separate a 14 X.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.800]   And we're going to just keep iPadOS thing as usual.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.000]   That was even in its current state.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Even in its current state, I find myself using it more than again, as I said, I'm kind
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   of surprised.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   It's changed because of snappy.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   It's just like it's just.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Maybe that's it.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   It's just it's just faster.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.440]   It's just don't feel like you're on a little key board.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.200]   And I think there's something about the keyboard.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.680]   Like I finally went and got I didn't get the I didn't get the last generation.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.880]   So I skipped a whole generation of iPad.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:33.640]   And so it's my old one, which is now a controller for my switcher is still great.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   It's great.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.880]   The one thing about the iPads is they last forever.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.160]   Like my kids are using I got the original 12.9 that came out and they're still still
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.600]   use it every day, you know.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:48.120]   And so and so the but the new one, I think when I got the new, what really shifted for
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.280]   me immediately was that new keyboard because I just had the folio before.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.320]   I was like, okay, this is like a computer.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.560]   Like now I'm I feel like I'm there.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.240]   There's, you know, I wish that the problem I really have is that a lot of the Apple, the
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:10.440]   Mac OS apps, I don't feel translate very well to touch, you know, so like Omni Grafel, even
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.280]   keynote, I don't really like on, I don't like editing them on iPad.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.600]   So I'm hoping that I get something that's more now that now that I could theoretically
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.160]   have a mouse or a trackpad and I could type, I just want, I just want my mouse back because
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.640]   I can't, I just can't do things at a really fine level at those in on with my finger.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.040]   I should have brought mine with me because I bought instead of using the magic keyboard,
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.440]   I bought the Logitech Combo Touch.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.640]   Oh, how do you like it?
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   I like it.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.120]   People have told me, oh, the trackpads aren't as good and I think the keyboard's better.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.880]   And I think the trackpad is just as good.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.680]   In fact, it's very usable.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.600]   I like the fabric cover.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.520]   It's a full case.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.480]   I like it a lot, actually.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.120]   The only problem with a kickstand is you can't lie in bed and use the kickstand for it.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.120]   Well, keyboard very well.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.040]   I mean, the magic keyboard works better in in bed.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.960]   Yeah, it's like the surface, especially in the levitation mode when you when you just
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   click on it and just levitate.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.640]   That's a, you're like, wow, it really is magic.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.240]   So I'm going back and forth, but I think I actually like the combo touch from Logitech.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.720]   It's a hundred bucks less, which I also like after spending that much money on an iPad.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.720]   I'm kidding.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.880]   You don't have a robot arm next to your bed that holds your iPad at the time.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   I'll do it for you.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.720]   Lisa will hold it sometimes, but nothing very long.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.680]   I would thought for sure that you'd have robots just all over.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.680]   And then just mad.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   So then just mad.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.600]   And then I pay for it later.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.760]   So, so no, I really like it though.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.480]   I have to say, and I don't, I can't, I can't quantify it.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.560]   I didn't even want to mention it till you said the same thing, Alex.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.840]   I feel like the last one, I didn't feel like I could really replace a laptop with this.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.120]   Maybe it's because I spent so much on it, but this one, I feel like I can for some reason.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:57.320]   And I do think that when I when I'm recommending things to people about the about the iPad,
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:03.260]   I really try hard to not not to use the shorthand of using it as a laptop because you really
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.600]   can't because a laptop could be used like a laptop and it's so much better at being a
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.440]   laptop than the iPad is.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.280]   This is a device with more flexibility that can be used in different situations, particularly
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.760]   mobile ones.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:22.520]   And to to Alex's point earlier, I think the only thing that's kind of like lower case
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:29.480]   F frustrating me with it is that, for instance, the the web browser, we get you get a dumb
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:35.380]   down mobile web browser, even even the Safari is really nice Chrome is really nice.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.540]   The brave duck duck go, they're all really, really nice.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:45.540]   But boy, this has the horsepower to run a full desktop scale browser so that my experience
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:51.340]   and Safari on my desktop Mac, my experience in Chrome on my desktop back Mac can and should
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:56.020]   be a one to one experience feature for feature user interface element for user interface
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.380]   element on this really, really wonderful iPad with its big screen.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.380]   And the only frustration points I'm having are where areas where, wow, if this were Chrome
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:10.580]   or if this were Safari on my desktop, this would be like a one click operation or a one
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.180]   tap operation.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.020]   As it is, I'm going to have to do like a share to another app, then do another tap in order
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.080]   to make sure that this gets filed where I want it to be filed.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.900]   And then I'm even so I'm probably going to have to go back on my desktop and manage this
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:29.420]   later and given how core to the daily experience of web browser is, I think it's about time
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:41.020]   that Apple allowed a real desktop power browser to arrive on large screen iPads.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.500]   Anything, all right, so there's the laptops 14 and 16.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:54.100]   And I think given the leak, admittedly creepy by the ransomware gang are evil.
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.500]   I think that that's ransomware in the epic suit.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.500]   That's where all the news.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.500]   That's what I really think is.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:04.640]   I think Mark Gurman said this was coming very soon this summer and then John Prosser said
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.340]   that he expects hardware at WWDC.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.340]   So there are a lot of signs.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.980]   I mean, it seems like do we think an iMac Pro given that was disconnected?
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.340]   So now that's the question.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.900]   I think before the iMac Pro, I'm thinking an upgraded Mac Mini.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:25.220]   So they released last year new laptops and a new Mac Mini, but they were both kind of
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.180]   consumer level.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:32.300]   And I'm starting to see some noise about new Pro level Mac Mini and new Pro level laptops.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.540]   And that would kind of make sense.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.980]   And then what do you think?
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.740]   It feels like they all kind of go together like a new iMac Pro, new MacBook Pro and Mini
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.740]   Pro.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.620]   It's like these 24 inch iMacs though.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.620]   I don't know.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.620]   Yeah, but they're not.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   I mean, they're clearly not pro.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.620]   Not that they're pushed.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.260]   Yeah, the rumors and I think John Prosser put out pictures.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.900]   He said he's seen it and he put out renders of what it looks like and it looks good except
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.500]   people are complaining the ports are too close together, but that could just be a hopefully
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.580]   that's just a rendering glitch.
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:06.780]   But it was a glass or some kind of plastic top on a much thinner chassis and he said that
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.340]   might be so they can have alternate colors.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:13.140]   But that sounds weird on a Pro machine and then that the M1 Mac iMac was pushed back a
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.700]   bit because it took them longer than anticipated to get the M1 Mini.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.820]   Sorry, iMac's done.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.060]   So that's coming maybe this fall.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.580]   So Prosser thinks that Mini is coming, right?
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.860]   Yeah, it's hard to follow the reviews.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.300]   It's hard to tell rumors.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.500]   It's hard to tell whether that's WWC or what is coming mean.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.500]   Yeah, is it?
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:36.980]   Doesn't all this imply a successor to the M1 processor or are they talking about taking
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.980]   the M1 profile?
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.980]   Yeah, I feel as though the...
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:40.980]   M1 apps.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.620]   Yeah, yeah, because you're going to have to have more data buses, you're going to have
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.460]   to have more channels, you're going to have to have more RAM addressability once you
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.460]   get to the next level.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:55.260]   I think that Apple is very, very nicely filled out that first generation of ordinary typical
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.260]   users.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.620]   I think that you have the MacBook Air and you have the iMac and then the rest of the stuff
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.580]   that's out right now are for people who couldn't wait or didn't want to wait for like the really,
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:12.060]   really good, like the next generation CPUs to hit the new MacBook Pro and the new Mac
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.260]   Mini and the new Pro iMac.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.700]   Yeah, just a little bit.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:25.100]   Do you believe the reading of the tea leaves from appletrack.com?
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:33.860]   They're looking at the invitation to the WWDC, the new image which came off, came out a couple
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:41.380]   weeks ago, hidden in the reflection of one character's eyes are three emoji characters
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.980]   referenced by their Unicode names.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.980]   But are the...
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.980]   Oh, no, that's...
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:47.980]   What are the characters?
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.900]   That's just Eat Sleep Code.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.900]   That's the...
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.220]   Yeah, forking knife, Eat Sleep.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.540]   Forking knife, Sleeping Z's and the MacBook emoji.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.940]   So that's Eat Sleep Code.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:59.940]   Okay.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.580]   That's like a WWDC tag line.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.820]   That's a very clever Easter egg.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:05.860]   Come to think of it.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.140]   So you don't think that that means they'll be a MacBook.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.060]   There'd be less confusion if they used the person coding because there's two emoji.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.220]   There's one of just the MacBook and one of the person.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.220]   Okay.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.220]   Maybe they chose that on purpose.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.220]   It's a conspiracy Leo.
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.220]   What about the...
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:26.860]   What about the shadowy figure in the post credit sequence of the last keynote?
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:33.620]   Prosser does in response to the Apple track article say I can confirm MacBook Pro is coming.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.860]   But coming when?
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:35.860]   That's not...
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.860]   That doesn't say anything.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.860]   Do you have the...
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   I can confirm a Mac Pro is coming.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:40.860]   Obviously.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.860]   Yes.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:42.860]   It will become...
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:48.300]   But another question is how are constraints of components going to affect whatever Apple
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.140]   intends to do for the receiver?
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.380]   Intel has already made an announcement or, excuse me, or at least, I don't know if you'd
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:58.100]   call it a prophetic announcement, but they're saying that, hey, we expect chip shortages
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.620]   to last in 2022.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.980]   I think that's what makes this a call.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.980]   That's what makes this a predictable.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.980]   I mean, what's...
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.300]   Interested in the call saying that the leading edge nodes are fine.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.980]   Apple's bought so much 5 nanometer that there shouldn't be any issue.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.940]   They might just have to switch priorities a little bit.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.700]   Like, the iPhone comes out first.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:18.540]   The other thing comes out a month later just because the iPhone always comes first.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.220]   But it's the trailing edge that gets heard.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:25.100]   And that's things like 90 nanometers where they're still doing some controllers and some
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:30.140]   third party chips that get thrown in the mix that aren't Apple proprietary.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:37.180]   I mean, what we're hearing from the whole supply chain is just that it's just chaos.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.180]   It's still chaos.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:43.900]   And we keep on hearing it from different partners that they're getting, oh, right, it was two
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.300]   weeks now, it's six months or nine months.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.700]   And it's just going to be a really hard summer and fall for a lot of...
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:55.620]   And again, I don't know if it'll be Apple's core products, but a lot of the, you know,
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:01.420]   ancillary products and accessories could really be hindered by that process.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.660]   It's still more premium max than Samsung sells premium phones.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.460]   So they get their orders filled.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.460]   Right.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.460]   Yes, it's Apple.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.460]   Yeah, it's central.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.180]   Yeah, Apple doesn't have kind of priority everywhere.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.060]   So they, I don't think that their core, like what they're actually selling us is going to
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.060]   be a problem.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.060]   It's all the little things that connect to it that are going to be more popular.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.060]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:25.300]   I mean, you can say, well, they're definitely going to get the M1s or M1Xs, but there are
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:30.620]   other chips in there and other other companies providing them that maybe in short supply.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.420]   Take a look at, if you were not in the first hour or two of buying an iPad Pro, you were
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:39.980]   delayed until June and now New Warriors are what, it's July a little bit late in that.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   Right.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   Right.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.220]   So the third part is that Apple affects a lot of these things.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.020]   Like I, one manufacturer said because of the way Apple buys stuff, that there was a point
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.460]   where some of these chips, they had 90% of the world's supply.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.300]   You know, and, you know, and it doesn't look like that on the surface, but they're buying
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:00.580]   them from so many different manufacturers and so many different suppliers that it,
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.740]   it kind of quietly sucks up all, all of it.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:06.820]   And so they, I had, we had a partner with one chip, one little chip, and they couldn't
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.500]   release the product for a year.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.500]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.700]   Because, because the Apple had all of them, you know, because it happened to be, you know,
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:16.740]   they happened to share that one little like surface mount chip, like tiny little spec
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.260]   with, with Apple, you know, where they canceled, they thought their orders would plunge during
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.140]   the pandemic and they didn't and then they had to get back, back of the line when they
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.500]   reordered any surprises on Monday.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:32.140]   Anything that we, they've been rumored, revised AirPod pros.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.980]   I'm pretty excited about the new HomePod.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:36.980]   Don't say it if you don't.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.980]   That's not coming.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.980]   That's not coming.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.420]   I don't, did you see what LeBron James was wearing, Leo?
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.780]   And it's, I tried to say, I tried to keep a straight face.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.100]   It was very well done.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.980]   It fooled me for about a millisecond.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.100]   I made everybody blink for a little bit.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.860]   LeBron James on his Instagram, what's, what's in his ear is there?
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.220]   It's, what is that?
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:02.540]   Those it turns out of the new unreleased Beats Studio Buds, which have been widely removed,
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   rumored.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.860]   That is, by the way, look like those are horrific pictures.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.820]   I'm just, I'm looking at his teeth more than I'm looking at his ears, but it looks like
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.180]   he's got chewing gum in his ears.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.260]   I don't know what's going on with the mouth.
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.260]   He's angry.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:18.260]   I don't want to mess with the guy.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.580]   If that is really what they looked like, that's like, it looks like a piece of gum stuck
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.580]   in your ear.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.620]   I guess the problem is that I think he's rocking it.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.620]   He's rocking it.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.620]   Okay.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.620]   Good.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.500]   I'm afraid that every time, every time Apple releases something, we go, that looks stupid.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.940]   And before you know it, everybody's like, that's the end thing.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.220]   You know, like it always, it, I don't know how they do it.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:38.460]   You always, you just like, oh, that the, the, the, the, we locked, came, came out of your
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.460]   ear.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.460]   Stupid human brain.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.820]   We mocked the white, the white wires and it turned out to be a trademark.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:48.260]   We mocked the little dripping icicle coming out of your ear.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.980]   Turns out, yeah, everybody likes that.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.020]   And it looks weird without them.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.780]   We are all survivors of the acid watch, watch Jean's trend.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.780]   Here's King James.
[00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.500]   We cannot speak of such things that people not wanting to look silly for fashion.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:04.940]   There's King James pretending that he doesn't know that his Instagram social media at guru
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:11.740]   was taking his picture with those new earbuds in his ear.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740]   So there it is.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.740]   Ooh, that's a scary picture.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.820]   And they announced the last in 2017 when they announced everything.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.460]   It was 2016 when they announced the air pods, they announced the beats versions at the same
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460]   time.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.940]   So maybe new air pods, maybe new beats pods, we call them, yeah, Monday, right?
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:32.940]   Have you, have you, what, what do we think about the idea of a AirPods Max mini or AirPods
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.940]   Max AirPods Max.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:36.940]   So small, you won't know you're wearing them.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.940]   Why AirPods Max?
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.940]   You're not working on them, but.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:46.060]   Just like, like, imagine that I've been, I've been hearing ideas about having a set of
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:51.540]   a $550 version of overhead over the ear headphones that they make a version that's more competitive
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.540]   with Sony's headphones.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   Well, that would make sense.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   Since I just bought them, I think they probably should remember.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.740]   Yeah, that's the sign, right?
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.740]   The obias them in the neighborhood.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.740]   That would make sense.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.140]   I, I fought that to send now.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.140]   I know you do.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.140]   You know, I bought them this week.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.140]   They're mine.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.140]   They're mine.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   This week too.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.140]   Same thing.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.140]   Something new comes out.
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.140]   That's going to be bumped because it was your fault because it was that special audio conversation.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.140]   It was my fault.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.060]   And then I get in the same reason I had pro with no headphone jack.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:22.740]   I said, well, you're my masters, whatever, what is that I will?
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:23.740]   What is that?
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.620]   Because the audience Leo, you're here for the audience.
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:30.620]   I'm still, I'm still stuck with the iPad or the iPod Max mini.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.620]   I think that's a great.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.620]   I told you.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   It's over the ear.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620]   It's in the ear.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620]   It's all around the ear.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.300]   It's just like, it's like your face.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   I like it.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   I like it.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.140]   I think that now I want one because I think that that was good.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.820]   Yeah, you've just created a need.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.100]   I buy whatever you tell me to buy.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.100]   So that's interesting.
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.100]   That's interesting.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.100]   It's like no headband.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.100]   Just maybe it's attached to your head by suction.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:59.980]   No, it just, but imagine the air pods.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:05.780]   True, really, air pod Max, but not, but not, like, not apple silly.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.780]   Imagine that you basically say, by the way, it's, we can't, we can't make them so that
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.580]   you, that so that you can only carry them like a little purse.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:17.860]   Oh, and by the way, we can't make them out of such metal that it's tiring to exactly what,
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.300]   what if we made it so that the, so that the normals could actually afford one?
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.860]   I think, I think you go to the AirPod Max Max Max Max Max.
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.860]   Max Max.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.860]   It's just a helmet.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:27.860]   It's a helmet with AR.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:31.100]   It's got like AR and then it sits there and it's like all over.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.380]   It's just, you're just totally in.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:34.180]   It's got like nine speakers in it.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.180]   Yeah, the air pod hummer.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.180]   The new air house.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:40.220]   It's also there AR VR helmet.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.100]   They finally fixed the idea of, you know, how do you, how do you get those displays and
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.660]   a ton of technical sort of thing?
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.020]   Well, we'll find out Monday.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.660]   It's the other suit that makes it to where.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   Which picture?
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.660]   There's a prosser put up a picture of what the new Mac Mini Pro looks like.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:02.700]   And it's, I really, I'm really interested in the idea of a Mac Mini Pro.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   I don't know why.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.860]   This is the one that has the, that's the sweet spot for me.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.420]   Plexiglass top on it.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.500]   I, I like that idea.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.220]   And of course, it's got the, somebody in the charm says, Leo, they don't call it the
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220]   mag safe.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.340]   It's just the magnetic power adapter.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.340]   Okay, fine.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.140]   I'm calling it mag safe.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.740]   And I'm, I'm actually mag safe.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.740]   I do love this.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.460]   But I can't put my floppies on top of it.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   Fine.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.460]   Boy, this is just dumb design.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.460]   Fine.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.020]   It's got four Thunderbolt four or maybe even USB four ports.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.660]   It's got two USB A ports.
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.660]   It's got ethernet.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.820]   It's got HDMI.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.220]   It's got a Plexiglass top.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.220]   This is a render.
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.220]   So it's made up.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.220]   It's completely invented.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.220]   Well, he says he gets the pictures.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.300]   He doesn't want to get the person in trouble if there's anything identifying in the pictures.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.020]   So he gets them re rendered so that they're clean.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.660]   It's nice and small.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:04:01.500]   I hope that if it's a Mac mini, I still hope that they're going to have some measure of
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.380]   expandability inside, although the M1 problem looks like the boy.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.380]   Absolutely.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.260]   It looks like it's one little motherboard with everything on it.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:15.180]   Is there a market for the Mac mini?
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.180]   What?
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.180]   It doesn't seem like man.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.020]   Well, I know you buy him.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.020]   You're the market.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020]   You're so great.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.020]   I am the market.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.020]   How many more can we buy?
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.020]   I don't know.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020]   I think we have.
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:30.860]   I think we had there was a discussion whether we had 14 or 16 of them right now, but they're
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.740]   just this incredible little like glue and we use them for all kinds of stuff.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.100]   And so that's what's great about them.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:42.500]   I'm going to go with the 16-inch MacBook Pro and I'm going to go with the Mac mini
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.940]   Pro.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.180]   I would still like to see them do a mini Mac Pro.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   Yes.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:53.540]   Because I love the iPhone out of mini and Mac.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.660]   A little cheese grater on my desk.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.620]   I might even hold out for the little cheese grater.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.740]   But I think those three make sense.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.420]   Maybe an update for AirPods.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.420]   What do you guys think?
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.420]   Is that?
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.660]   It's time for an update for AirPods.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   AirPods.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.220]   It's still like a hot hot seller.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:19.220]   There's still the $550 headphones are aspirational at best.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:24.780]   And $200 you're actually competing on a playing field where Apple can really, really succeed
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.660]   because you're saying, well, for about $18 more than these okay, but not great headphones,
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:35.060]   I can get not only can I have superior engineering, but I can also have that very important like
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.500]   eight millimeters of stick up with a little Chrome at the end of it that makes people
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.660]   know that I've been to the Apple store.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.660]   Why the plexiglass on the top?
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.500]   Is that just design?
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   He said it could be colors, but it doesn't make sense to me to be colors on a pro.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.180]   Like I imagine colors would be the consumer version.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.180]   Right.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180]   Like they did.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.180]   I'm kind of wondering whether they're perfectly happy.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.180]   Oh, they might.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.780]   If they might get integrate with the if they're making it integrate with the with the iMac,
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.820]   meaning that the same office that would have colorful iMacs would also have colorful Mac
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:02.820]   minis.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.820]   Right.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.100]   But that would that would suggest that it's not going to be the super powerful machine.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.060]   I mean, the the iMac has the the Mac mini has a great, great role to play because how
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.860]   much money does that panel cost it an iMac?
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.860]   And for people who look, I've already got displays.
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.860]   They're very, very nice.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.860]   I like them.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.860]   I don't even want one to split.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.500]   Yeah, if it has an HDMI port, I have the display.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.900]   I have that 55 inch OLED display.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.700]   I would love to be able to switch back and forth between a Mac and a Linux box.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.300]   I'd love to I'd like to be able to upgrade for $800 instead of operating for $1,300
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   $14.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.780]   I would like to point out that that that every year the Mac mini looks more and more
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.740]   like the original, the first gen Apple TV.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.660]   It does is flatter and flatter.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.940]   It's almost the same height now.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.860]   It's like, yeah, what are we going to do?
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.260]   Ah, don't we have a design somewhere in the back?
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.300]   Oh, yeah, yeah, we use this.
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.220]   Let's change the connectors in the back and we'll be done.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.780]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.340]   That's our that's our kind of predictions unless anybody has anything else to say about
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.340]   Monday.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.340]   It'll be out.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.420]   The last little ad is that we've we've had such we've had W.C. with no new hardware
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.500]   recently, like 2018 and we've had like one or two pieces like 2019.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   You're in 2017.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.140]   We had all the hardware.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.140]   So there's no trains.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.580]   It's possible to really predict.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.780]   There's no trend for this.
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:20.020]   And of course, this is this year is going to be a completely break from tradition because
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.540]   we're we're all have we have to re release everything with Apple Silicon.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.940]   Apple has to also consider internally how many Intel versions of this do we have?
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:32.660]   Because of course, the minute they come out with a Mac mini power Mac mini with Apple
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:34.780]   Silicon, nobody's going to buy the Intel version.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.180]   So those those Intel's they got to clear those out.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.300]   There'll be a few cranky studio people who are not going to rev a board.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.860]   Oh, no, I don't buy all of them.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:47.220]   If your tool doesn't work on M one, you know, you're going to keep them in the freezer.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.420]   Yeah, it's it's a pro tools.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.260]   Pro tools are still running on Mojave.
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.420]   So there's a lot of pro tools users who would not consider an upgrade, but that's why the
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.060]   Mac Pro is the last to get upgraded, right?
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.860]   Yeah, probably.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.860]   The only other thing is that remember that Apple's coming coming out of the Epic trial.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:11.900]   They're also coming into even more of a sticky mess regarding how they run the app store
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:17.980]   with other agencies and other actual actual governments as opposed to civil lawsuits.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:23.260]   If Apple had been planning to make some changes to a because hey, let's just we let's just
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.420]   do the first big house cleaning we've done for a long, long time on App Store policies
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:33.300]   and rules and or let's make some let's take a look at where we're vulnerable to future
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.900]   problems with the regulators and let's head those off.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.660]   And it's because it is a developer conference.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.820]   They could be they could be talking about big changes.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:42.820]   The app store.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.220]   I completely agree with you.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.220]   This is when you're going to announce that.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.300]   Nothing along the lines of nothing along the lines of allowing like extra side loading
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.140]   apps or no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:57.840]   but just little, little modifications that say again, these, this made sense like five
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840]   years ago.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840]   It's okay.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840]   It does make sense for us right now.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.080]   So we're bringing this change.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.180]   We're going to make this easier.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.540]   We're going to.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:08.780]   I predict the biggest change to the app store since we launched it.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.780]   I don't know what it'll be.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.780]   It's an app store.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.060]   But it's got to be something that like the million dollar cap, which will make indie
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.060]   developers super happy.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.060]   Exactly.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.460]   Really really stick it to Epic and Spotify.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.460]   Exactly.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460]   Exactly.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.860]   It's going to be it's going to be great to see who gets featured.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:30.140]   This is going to be like, it's like, it's like, it's like, at these, at these big like
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:35.980]   estates and like 19, the 1910s, the robber barons who gets to sit like next to Carnegie,
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.140]   who gets to see who gets to sit like two seats down.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.740]   Who has Apple announces the return of Fortnite to the app store on there being a car.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:42.740]   Did anybody know anybody?
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:43.740]   No.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.740]   No.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.820]   Well, and I think one of the things that I think some people are looking at is, I mean,
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.860]   obviously highlighting unreal is out.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:57.620]   So will Apple go down the unity route or will they go down the AR?
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.620]   That will be your own.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:59.620]   They're watching.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.620]   Yes.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.060]   So it's that will be in the state of the developer state of the union.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.060]   Monday afternoon.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.060]   You know, I don't know.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.260]   I mean, they, this is where we usually see the most AR is, you know, because that's
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:15.060]   what you're kind of showing the developers of where this is going.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:21.100]   And so the question really is, is, are they going to, you know, have another external partner
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.620]   and be in unity?
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.660]   Or are they going to show more of their own tools where, you know, we had AR, you know,
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.820]   creator and so on and so forth.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:32.620]   And so, so it'll be interesting to see which direction that they go to show that.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.420]   They won't be showing you E5.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   No.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.620]   You know, it's really impressive.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.620]   It's really cool.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.620]   I know.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.620]   I know.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.620]   I know.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.620]   I can't.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.580]   It's really cool.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.060]   It's, it's is unity.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.900]   Have anything comparable to it now?
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.420]   Unity has a lot of great things.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:55.500]   It's just, it's just a different, it's a different, it does a lot of, you know, it's,
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.500]   it's a little bit more easy.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.660]   It's a little easier to develop on.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:03.300]   I would say and, and, but right now I'm in the middle of a big, you, unreal production.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.140]   I'm pretty impressed by you, E5.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.140]   All right.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.140]   Oh, really?
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:34.420]   Are they using it for the M
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:39.100]   after I have to just watch a little stone fire all the way to this?
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.700]   Because they, this came out this week.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.540]   Yeah, the new UEM.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.540]   I've demoed.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.780]   There's so many tools, you know, inside of there and I moved from my bedroom TV, like
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:55.220]   at 1 a.m. to the living room TV because I was getting so engrossed by this demo.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.260]   Like they can't possibly look as good as that, please.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.820]   It's, it's pretty, it's pretty lifelike, isn't it?
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   I mean, that's what's amazing.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:02.820]   Oh, man.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:06.740]   Well, and you think about like you go back and realize that this is in real time, you
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.260]   know, and, and that's the thing that starts to get really exciting is that, you know,
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.180]   I think about how long it took to render frames from Toy Story or even Toy Story 2 or
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.300]   3, you know, a while back, you know, Pixar keeps on pushing the outer envelope, but I
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:23.860]   mean, being able to do all of the stuff in, in, in real time, just from a storytelling
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.860]   perspective.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:29.620]   I mean, the game stuff is important, but just from a being able to animate stuff and,
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.740]   and put it together and be able to render that out.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.460]   I think we're going to see a whole new set of cartoons and storytelling.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.460]   It's all done in Unreal.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.500]   And there's already people that have been doing it that's been on the outer edge, but
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.460]   now it's about to become a thing.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:47.100]   I kind of get me a new gaming PC.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.300]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.060]   I just got one.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.340]   Well, AMD did have announcements yesterday, Leo.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.340]   I know.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.340]   Four times retail.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.340]   Four times retail.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.740]   The way you're six times retail.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:02.260]   The 3080 Ti is now out for a mirror.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.260]   What is it?
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:04.260]   $1,080.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.260]   New RP.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.260]   What else?
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:12.420]   They have those, they're doing their version of a system on a chip for, for much better
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.620]   graphics performance on my iPhone.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:14.620]   Which I love.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.620]   Oh, nice.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.540]   Yeah, I should look at.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.700]   I want to play Valheim on, on the go.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:25.980]   Oh, we know you do.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   It's gotten bad.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:32.340]   I got to the point where Lisa actually has to come and sit with me.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.740]   Just to keep me from overheating.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.540]   She fans me while I'm playing.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:36.460]   Our show today.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:39.860]   You know what keeps me from overheating actually?
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:44.740]   I just can't do Valheim in bed is our new Casper mattress.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.420]   Love your tomorrows with Casper.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:53.220]   The new Casper cooling collection is everything you need to help you sleep cool all night
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.820]   long.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:58.820]   Now with these hot summer nights, this might be something you want even more than ever.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:04.540]   But I have to tell you all year long, research shows you sleep better when you sleep just
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.340]   slightly cool.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:10.020]   Casper's mattresses with a new snow technology help you do that.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:16.220]   So do the hyper light sheets, the new lightweight duvets, even the breathable mattress protector.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:20.660]   They're all designed to keep you cool and comfortable so you can't help but love your
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.660]   tomorrow.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:25.180]   As a new day, make the most of it with Casper's new cooling collection there.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:31.340]   Wave hybrid snow mattress keeps you cool for 12 plus hours pulling heat away from your
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:37.060]   body for sustained temperature regulation, a cool to the touch feeling and a much improved
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.060]   tomorrow.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.700]   Better bedding makes for better tomorrow as well.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:44.060]   That's why you want Casper's hyper light sheets with their innovative grid weave that lets
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.420]   air flow through for maximum breathability.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.140]   Even their dovaser lightweight.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:54.900]   You still get the the the plush comfort but you also get optimal temperature control and
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.460]   don't forget you need a breathable mattress protector to improve the coolness of the bed
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:04.580]   even further because air can flow between your body and your mattress with Casper's breathable
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.060]   mattress protector.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:11.460]   All of them designed to work together to prevent overheating all night long because cooler
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:16.860]   sleep means better sleep and better sleep means better tomorrow's even Sammy the cat
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.100]   agrees.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.260]   As always, Casper offers free shipping free returns when it comes to a better's night
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.260]   sleep.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.140]   You can't beat Casper's new cooling collection.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:28.800]   They've got you covered focus on tomorrow like Casper handle the rest explore Casper

[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:09.780]   Lisa nice to be a Casper we my kids sleep on Casper's or Debbie's sister-in-law sleeps
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:14.700]   on I think everybody I know it's we've Casper fight America.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.220]   I'm very keen to hear about this their new computational betting system where it's not
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.780]   so much the betting that's there but it's the sensation that it can for feedback based
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.420]   on your sleep inside the room.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:35.740]   Wait a minute what if I could connect Valheim to the betting.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:39.620]   Did there used to be like an audio like an audio piece of like home theater audio gear
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620]   called the butt kicker.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.460]   Yes these these things you put underneath like most in your in your sofa.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.100]   So it actually like shake the sofa.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:53.580]   Yeah we you know I know the butt kicker because didn't we used to in our booth at CES in the
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.700]   South Hall was always across from the butt kicker booth and we always know they were
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:09.380]   doing the demos of the of the butt kicking because the whole place would start to shake.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.580]   Speaking of the new iPad and I this is cut I didn't know anything about this but thanks
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:24.340]   to the folks at Halide they have discovered a hidden power in the new iPad pro cameras.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:30.260]   There's a yeah there are you know it's good it's really good and I'm I was a little disappointed
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:36.740]   when last week I was informed that the camera is not as good as the iPhone 12 pro max camera.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.740]   Sorry.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.740]   Sorry.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.700]   But this new selfie thing is interesting.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:45.020]   So what is new what is it that we they discovered in this in the selfie selfie camera.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:50.980]   So it's Sebastian DeWitt who's really smart and Ben Sandofsky who's both geniuses and
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.460]   Andy can play it way better than me but the focal for some reason and I'm not sure why
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:59.220]   the focal distance is so much shorter than on the iPhone.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.220]   Huh.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.180]   So you can get much closer.
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:08.300]   So you can really and when you do it's ultra it's a ultra wide right.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.940]   So I think it's just a wide angle.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:18.220]   I think the all just more you know they say the iPad basically comes with a microscope
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.500]   because you can get so close.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.020]   The focus is closer on the front that's the front facing camera not the selfie camera.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.020]   Look at this.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.340]   That's really amazing.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:35.500]   Yeah, they're saying the front facing ultra wide has more more megapixels than the normal
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500]   one.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:42.740]   So it's basically an ultra ultra wide camera possibly so they're using because for that
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:48.220]   feature where AI can basically follow you and track you because they need more more amplitude
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.220]   and more stuff.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:52.660]   So basically they're saying that in the next versions of halide that they're going to find
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:58.340]   they found a way to actually tap into that so that you can go to that ultra wide by selection
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:05.380]   not just simply as a side effect of being able to use being use a zoom call where all
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.300]   of the eyes follow you around the room.
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:12.380]   Well the other problem of course is because of the lidar the focusing is very fast but
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:17.020]   when you're doing a macro shot you may want it you may not want it to be doing focusing
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.660]   on whatever it thinks it's focusing on.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.820]   So halide also has a manual focus feature and that's another.
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.940]   They're pan and scanning right like that.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:26.780]   That's the whole trick is that they're using the very wide frame and then they're cropping
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:30.540]   in and they're zooming in and out of that crop and panning and scanning around to make
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.900]   it they're basically punching out the wide angle from the ultra wide angle and using
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.900]   the ultra wide angle as computational distance to keep you in frame.
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:39.900]   Okay.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.620]   I think it's ultra it's all to the cameras ultra wide and only ultra wide and just simply
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:47.980]   lies to you when it's not when it's yes you're asking it to do something that doesn't require
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.140]   extra pixels.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:55.580]   I have been playing with FaceTime and zoom I really love it that I can move around and
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.940]   the front facing camera and if you know the selfie camera to follows me around it doesn't
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:00.940]   work.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.940]   At least it can come into the shot.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:03.940]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.260]   I've seen this before.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:09.180]   I mean there are other cameras that do this the portal did it.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.780]   They're owned by Facebook.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:17.180]   But it's owned by Facebook but but it's actually fairly useful and Apple is not quite as quick
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.660]   to move the camera.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.660]   So it's a little less jarring.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.660]   I don't know.
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:21.660]   I just think it's well implemented.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.740]   So that's another nice feature.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:27.300]   But they did also say that to your point earlier.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.580]   My attention was was was attracted by oh yeah there's an ultra wide mode that you're not
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.980]   supposed to be able to use but we're figuring out how to use it.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:40.900]   But yeah they also said that there is basically has a macro mode super super close close focusing
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.060]   because of the lens arrangement from it.
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:48.700]   So again this is this is this is this is why we need developers like these that are
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:52.380]   just going to beat on this hardware and figure out oh well what do you know it turns out
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:56.940]   that we can give you a feature that Apple decided Apple opted not to give you for free.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:04.900]   Well yeah so if you want to read more lux.camera which is the halide blog and they talk in
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:12.260]   great detail Sebastian do it talks a great detail about what's going on and why Leo shouldn't
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:18.100]   be quite so disappointed in the choice of cameras for the iPad at least there's.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.420]   Sebastian is again legit genius he did the famous leather version of the fine my app
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:27.220]   he did double twist on Android I think he basically invented sub pixel anti aliasing
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:30.100]   on Android back in the day and now he's been working on this.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:34.340]   It's the little things yeah yeah yeah I didn't realize he did a double twist that's cool
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.340]   yeah it's a big yeah.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:39.020]   Yeah but the which was which was a hell of a hell of a trick back in the day.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:44.980]   This is this is he really is he routinely comes up with these old school type apps that
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:53.100]   the the bummer of modern app tech of app kits is that it really is hard to get out of whatever
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:59.820]   list of approved access to the hardware and access to the API's that the the the manufacturer
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:06.900]   lets you have it really does require that you just bang on every single door and just
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:11.420]   every time that you do a test and the answer is wow that's funny I didn't expect that now
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:15.540]   your entire weekend is shot because you have to figure out exactly why was I able to do
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:21.340]   what is implied by the fact that when I that that there are more that there's this is supposedly
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:26.820]   a low resolution camera and yet it's able to follow me without having a motorized mount
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:31.460]   on that lens and then just poking and prodding until you make it do this thing that Apple
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:38.980]   did not intend you as the developer to do unless of course the Apple decided to quietly in
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.020]   a conversation with the developers say hey isn't that interesting I hope I'm looking
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:47.260]   forward to what we're looking forward to any ideas that you might have in the next version
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:52.420]   of halide as opposed to photography on the iPad yeah I'm the boss public library opens
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:58.260]   reopens in about a week and a half two weeks I can't number one on my agenda is to just
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:03.980]   do photography with just halide on the iPad because halide is made has given me a lot
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:09.820]   of smiles over the past week just see what it can do yeah it new halide like who yeah
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:15.660]   depth stuff the depth stuff is ridiculous yeah so so just to recap because I think I muddled
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:22.300]   the two things that the there is an ult the camera on the selfie cameras ultra wide and
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:27.780]   Apple uses that's how Apple does the moving around thing and so it's able to it only
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:33.300]   does a crop of it but it also center stages yeah with software it's able to really correct
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:38.820]   for what is normally in an ultra wide lens a lot of distort barrel distortion and then
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:44.220]   on the other side the the what do you call that is that the selfie your camera is the
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:49.900]   front facing camera the rear camera I guess yeah you it turns out you can really get a
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:55.980]   lot closer than you can on an iPhone for macro photography that trick differently the opposite
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.140]   of that trick on the iPhone because for the last two versions of the iPhone if you didn't
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:04.580]   care about their rich rich sweater mode with deep fusion you could enable extended capture
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:08.500]   and that way if you took like a group picture with the wide angle and you chopped off somebody
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:12.500]   you could press a button and it also took the ultra wide frame and you could re center
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:20.460]   it so Andy I expect you to get right up close to those squirrels right up you know I'll
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:25.740]   all in your in in your honor I will smear peanut butter like one inch underneath the
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.980]   camera sensor I have so you can get the full the full effect of camera noses and whiskers
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.260]   right in the face of the camera I found that there are two words that that enable that
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:41.060]   it's candied peanuts you know what you got candy peanuts you're gonna get a picture of
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:46.740]   Leo in the wild right out close they are good you have to decide how much you're gonna
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:52.380]   share with the squirrel man here's by the way from Sebastian's a post and Lux dot camera
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:57.980]   on the left is the closest you can focus on an iPhone 12 pro max on the right is the
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:02.420]   closest you can focus with the iPad that's a significant difference and then the close
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:08.100]   up gives you really a good kind of macro style result so that's pretty that's pretty cool
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:14.740]   yeah did we know that Apple posted the ADA's just a little while ago the what developer
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:21.020]   works we know they posted the finalists but they've actually posted the finalist yeah
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:26.820]   these this is not the awards will be announced at later in the day on Monday yeah but these
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:31.420]   are the finalists in case you're interested you wish we go through them across the alert
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:36.660]   pop up yes here it is this is from nine to five Mac the finalists announced a couple of
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:42.260]   hours ago for the apple design awards this is these are pretty important apple decides
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:45.820]   pretty the apple sites prettier if you want to click through to it oh yeah let's do that
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:52.260]   yeah let's do that this is really boring they have icons everything sorry I'm so I'm so
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:56.300]   superficial design no no no this is and most people are listening but for those of you
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:03.740]   watching you deserve the highest quality images so what is the inclusivity category I'm not
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:10.180]   sure what that is I think that's you know for accessibility and including different voices
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:18.220]   okay so one password but also like diverse a monsters expedition Alba holovista me a kids
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:25.580]   diary by tiny bop and voice dream reader so I guess that means one password would be the
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:33.700]   most the best accessible most accessible password manager I guess not sure in the delight and
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:44.300]   fun category little orpheus the Chinese room pop pop playroom pool side and FM so good I
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:48.180]   haven't played any of these but this is going to give me something to do tonight if I can
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:56.440]   tear myself away from Viking Val House building raccoo gaki AR south of the circle and wonder
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.780]   box I said they did light and fun category in in the interact I'm not sure I like these
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:06.340]   categories I don't that's not clear what yeah they're opaque in the interaction category
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:15.500]   yeah bird alone carrot weather for us snarkitude craft Nova from panic which I use in love that's
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:22.700]   a Mac app so these are all these are iPads these are Mac or what what is the deal on this
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:28.380]   now I'm confused I thought this was I had a very old IOS yeah yeah Nova which is only
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:38.940]   on Mac sping SP exclamation mark SP bang in G and wonder box some of these are iOS I know
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:45.180]   they are I don't understand a lot I mean a lot of these were are fun entertaining apps
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:53.900]   I'm there not a whole lot that show off exactly how powerful a Mac or or an iOS device can be
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:58.700]   right so this is what it's like Renee said I maybe I'm just being confused by the fact
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:03.180]   that there aren't dedicated categories of best productivity best game best educational best
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:08.220]   that it just seems as though it's it's it's hard it's hard to figure out what the rhyme or reason
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:13.180]   of this is it's not like best director best producer it's like the ideas exist only to say thank you
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:17.100]   for implementing the frameworks we told you to implement and I could write you're doing it right
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:22.220]   but honestly if I were Apple that's a good thing to give it a here's the reward for doing it right
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:32.300]   for the best bending of the knee yes bend the knee in social impact Alba a tentat 1942
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:37.100]   be my eyes which is an amazing app I'm familiar with that brief
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:43.820]   um which looks familiar but I can't remember what it does if found and kleema
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:49.340]   climate labs gmbh visuals and graphics this is these are the ones you want to look at
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:55.980]   because they're pretty behind a steel be honest steel sky I've played that beautiful genshin impact
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:02.620]   also beautiful but not beautiful in this in an unreal five cents but in a kind of artistic sense
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:11.900]   little orpheus luna or loona mission to Mars and not boring weather by Andy works no relation
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:19.580]   not boring weather well our Andy does work yes sort of innovation there's a licensing fee
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:31.180]   bird alone blind drive lll wild rift museum alive nad sadhana and universe and those are the
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:38.300]   nominees we the awards are monday afternoon or monday evening after the keynotes the apple
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:45.580]   cold trophy is it yeah yeah it's a it's a it's a very jony i've sort of thing i've i've said
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:52.140]   before it is the ultimate like apple device in that is very very rare uh it is brushed aluminum
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:56.940]   it has no visible buttons or anything and the most but then the most visible feature is a is a
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:05.260]   glowing apple logo yeah does it have is battery not included i think there's a there's an x-ray of
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:11.100]   so some one winner x-rated and it is like an interesting piece of technology that lights up
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.980]   when you touch it interact with it it does have batteries inside it although i can't remember
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:21.260]   whether they're i think you have to like a typical apple product you there no there's no user
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:26.380]   replaceable batteries inside with them if they call it after if exactly one year later your apple
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:31.260]   design awards that's lighting up because somebody else has won it now so that was a really good
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:36.620]   you have to go to karasel you're in the sun yeah it was funny this week when the rumor came out
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:40.620]   that johnnie i've contributed towards the new iMac because previously people like oh finally
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:45.340]   we're finally beyond the johnnie i've era and there's colors are back and this is back and then that
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:50.220]   rumor came out and all of a sudden it's like oh well that's why there's still a chin is incredible
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:55.580]   that johnnie i've worked on the 24 inch i guess it depends on what your definition of work this it
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:59.420]   could be like anything from you came into the lab johnnie we'd like to show you we'd like to show you
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:04.940]   we'd like to show you it's a sketch it's a sketch it's a sketch what is the color is really the essence
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:09.020]   of the iMac you gotta remember that these the iMac was probably designed two two years ago
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:13.660]   you know like it's not yeah i mean i'd be here as much now but when it was around when they were
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:17.180]   three years ago it's probably when that struck when the design of how it's going to look at
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:23.260]   probably started the story comes from jeremy white in the wired who says the 2021 iMac is a
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:29.420]   great family computer thanks to johnnie i've again i deserve us to have an handker unit kind yeah
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:38.220]   absolutely yeah oh okay um it was evans it was evans rumor all right well just just see the
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:42.780]   idea oh thanks to johnnie i've this is a successful product like oh because he hired evan hanky i'm not
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:47.740]   like i think they're saying he's because he still did it but and it's probably more like i don't
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:51.900]   know like i have no knowledge of how much he could exactly but could be anything from sketches to
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:56.780]   they showed it to him when he was in town for dinner yeah i i read that article and that's i
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:01.580]   reacted that way because it didn't the article doesn't seem to say exactly what contribution
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:06.940]   where his fingerprints are or if there's this was or even if this was just this is part of a pad
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:11.980]   of sketches that he made while he was at apple about the future trends for the iMac about hey well
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:17.260]   what if in the next what what if uh what if uh we what if our m1 plan our apple silicon plan comes
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:22.780]   with fruition around this time frame well then we could do this sort of a product as opposed to
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:27.900]   we hired him as a subcontractor to do major design work there's just no information and so that
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:32.140]   it just it just seemed like a kind of a frisky headline considering how much work went into it
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:37.980]   by people who are actually have still have apple badges and we know whether it's it's real or or
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:44.300]   just uh you know a formality that uh apple does employ johnnie ives the current design firm
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:50.300]   this is this is the um the paragraph from the wired story but apple has another reason to
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:55.100]   reference this old campaign johnnie ives was involved in the design of this new iMac
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:33:00.380]   despite having left apple back in 2019 hardware design is a long process so perhaps it's not
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:05.260]   surprising that ives his fingerprints are all over this new desktop i didn't see him but maybe
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:11.660]   i was gonna clean it for hours interestingly apple would not confirm or deny if he worked on the
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:17.500]   2021 iMac after he left the company but they did confirm he had worked on it so it's more than a
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:24.060]   rumor apple said yes he did work on it but yeah to what degree i think that blue is a little too blue
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:32.300]   or something it's the wrong trousers exactly his fingerprints and also some flexive
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:37.100]   pastrami because he did come in during a lunch break to take a look at the proposed design so and
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:41.820]   it was stuck in the metal it's now in the metal it's it's like his fingerprints yeah his pastrami
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:46.380]   his fingerprints you can tell by the chamfer angles on the on the prochetta forever
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:55.500]   uh there is also uh the apple swift student challenge those winners we do have because
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:02.780]   sorry they get to go to ww dc they get us what a special zoom room i don't know what they get
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:09.820]   but uh these are these are the kids uh they did they do this every uh year 350 swift student
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:14.620]   challenge winners from 35 different cut countries and regions will be among the
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.740]   globe the millions of global attendees well it's a little less special this year i think you're
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:25.740]   gonna see an increasing focus from all parties involved on students that are they're learning
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:30.700]   how to do this that are not necessarily college age yeah that's because you'll see that you know
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:37.180]   grow with google is focused on non-degree uh you know these companies are not getting the supply of
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:41.900]   of folks that they need uh at a rate that they need them and so they're basically starting to
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:46.140]   bypass education yeah you know and and go straight into like how do we train them directly because
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.860]   we need them now you know so here's one of the winners uh jana yan when the pandemic began
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:56.060]   jana yan's immunocompromised grandparents struggled to get essential supplies like groceries delivered
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:01.660]   to their home in hawaii she's 16 she lives in oakland she says my sister and i felt especially
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:08.220]   driven to help because we were so far away so they created feed fleet and app that pairs
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:13.660]   volunteers with at-risk individuals to deliver essential goods to their doorstep wow good for
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:20.220]   her 16 she joined she joined the farm link project a student created non-profit that helps farms
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:26.780]   connect their surplus produce to food banks they've redirected 30 million pounds of food she's now
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.340]   designing an app that will help students report incidents of sexual assault on school campuses
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:36.140]   and other that's just with breast cancer self-examinations and detecting heart disease and women
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:44.380]   and that's just during pandemic nice jana yan uh really nice uh here's another one just i like to
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:51.500]   highlight highlight these uh baniya denesh she's 15 from north bronzwick new jersey
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:58.140]   uh she said i went to a gastroenterologist he diagnosed me with a pelvic floor disorder
[01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:03.180]   then told me nothing about how i was supposed to get better so she created an app gastro
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:08.380]   at home she'll launch it this summer on the app store it helps people with gastro intestinal
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:14.700]   disorders access information and resources she's these are look i'm sorry go ahead i'm just saying
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:20.380]   she's scratching her own itch she is not yet graduated graduated from my school yeah but these these
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:26.700]   are exactly the sort of stories that apple loves to tell where it's not about kids who are like me
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:31.580]   15 saying i but i bet i could write my own operating system for the apple to eat right now it gets
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:39.100]   18 sectors instead of 16 seconds this is this is basically you know like normal humans who are
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:44.940]   see a need and just as just like you can you can hold a brush in your hand you can type something
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:50.860]   on a keyboard their idea is that hey i've got this i don't have to be a nerd i don't have to be
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.980]   motivated by a fascination with programming in order to write a piece a great piece of software
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:01.580]   that fills a need that i see that and that can benefit from my own point of view and this
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:07.500]   is it really is a great great great not even as a piece of PR it's just a great statement about
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.500]   the power of accessibility decoding here's a 17 year old from woodbridge
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:20.380]   virginia dami Lola afofasayo she she tried to get in a hackathons but couldn't so she and a friend

[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:56.700]   app that she will launch later this year on the app store she wants to uh she's in high school
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:02.300]   still she wants to study computer science and political science good for her those are the three
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:08.540]   that apple highlighted in their newsroom but there are many more unfortunately the prize this
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:15.260]   year isn't as wonderful as it has been in years past where you got a trip to see the WWDC conference
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:24.300]   you're in person but still a really nice honor a bunch of really cool people inside apple are
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:28.060]   responding eager to see their emails and responding to them and are going to help them with their
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:33.420]   future projects good so that's yeah gives you a little access because yeah because my what what
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:39.100]   what a very special trio of human beings that there's there's spot why that is that awesome because
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:44.940]   just not just hey i've made this app and i found this way to monetize it and now i'm i'm saying
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:50.540]   goodbye to college because i'm making too much money it's no here's a really cool here's a again
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:56.060]   it's point of view your eyes are on the ground you see a problem that you are motivated to fix that
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:01.260]   only you can pursue with that kind of a passion and my god are they doing a great job of it it's
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:09.660]   just so impressive and just really put the smile big smile on my face we uh i ran in a time last week
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:14.460]   before i could talk about this but uh this is a light week so i'm glad we could do it now
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:20.220]   apple has previewed some powerful software updates designed for people with disabilities
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:27.340]   i think they've all launched now if i'm not mistaken sign time launched uh may 20th to connect
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:32.620]   apple store and apple support customers with on-demand sign language interpreters so you can
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:40.460]   you can uh they will sign your uh session at the apple store which is which is really i think
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:47.500]   the rest are coming with the betas after dub dub okay okay by the way it supports ASL but also
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:53.660]   British sign language french sign language and it is in the web browser which i think is fantastic
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:40:00.380]   coming coming later assistive touch for apple watch it looks like magic that video was like magic
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:06.700]   well let me okay let's let's look at the video here so um i'll turn on the sound
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:12.700]   being able to operate on apple watch without being able to see the display for example to stop a timer
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:16.780]   double clench to activate assistive tall man hit your index finger and that's awesome
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:22.140]   we focus on the stop button then clench to confirm it can tell from your hand movements you can also
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:27.500]   use these gestures before the reactions the sensors and the pulse to answer a call you can double
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.820]   clench to immediately pick up well this work for everybody there are also additional controls i'm
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:36.220]   gonna use that app use men for people with with limb differences but it will work for everybody
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:42.540]   action menu pinch to move focus to the motion pointer and clutch to confirm wow now you can move
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:47.100]   your arm to hover the pointer over the oh no page yep then oh yes oh yes oh yes
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:54.940]   wow the motion pointer can also be activated by simply shaking your hand so that's a system
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:01.020]   with this new feature we're able to open the door so oh i am even more people getting chills
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:08.060]   that hasn't been possible enough that's brilliant so the accessibility team is so good how are they
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:13.980]   doing that i mean so they're somehow sensing your movements of your hand the accelerometer the
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:18.860]   gyroscope and the pulse reader depending on the what's happening with the blood flow going through
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:23.500]   your arm at any given time yeah and the and the other answer to that question is they're doing
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.140]   that because they care about making this happen yeah they're figuring out a way to happen instead
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:32.220]   of simply dismissing it and saying that well of course you know find motor control how you're
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:36.060]   gonna how you're gonna be able to hit a target that is this small it might be and you also have a
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:41.660]   problem holding your your other wrist steady oh well what can you do well well let's i don't know
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:46.060]   let's spend another let's spend a whole year and and a whole bunch of money trying to figure out how
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:51.420]   we can do this you you have to care about this stuff in order to make this stuff happen and this
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:55.820]   and apple absolutely cares about this stuff and spend a lot of money that's got a team working
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:00.380]   a long time to get that to work that's really a first time i met sarah harrelander who runs
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:04.860]   accessibility marketing at apple uh she's like the product marketing lead for this stuff it was i
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:10.300]   got a briefing about selfie mode for low and no vision people in the camera app and i and she's
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.660]   like most people say why would they want to take selfies but you know they want to do it's not
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.020]   that they want to see their own selfie they want to send it to all their friends and family so we
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:20.940]   figured out move your head it's not enough it's not bright enough you're too far to the left and we
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.700]   would talk them through the process and they they don't think about like they don't think about
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:27.740]   what feature because they like what are they missing out what can we deliver to them so they
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:32.380]   can have the most complete experience possible and every year like they they made cursor mode and
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:37.020]   now everybody has cursed their mode they made like like smart inverse now everybody has
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:41.660]   they they keep pioneering all this stuff over and over again there's will be on them and i don't think
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:44.940]   i don't think i mean there's this is such a deep commitment there and i don't think it has anything
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:50.220]   to do with it's not cash positive for them absolutely not they don't care about it's good PR just
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:54.940]   but even then it costs so much i'm sure hundreds of millions to do that no but they they get it's
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:59.420]   about accessibility isn't like oh isn't it nice of us that we're making this no it's like this is
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:05.740]   table stakes you have yes if you if if if there are your customer base concludes people of all
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:10.460]   different types you have to be you have to be able to serve all of those different people they have
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:16.460]   a right to demand that kind of stuff and so once again it comes to it's it's it's the world is not
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:22.140]   you know yin and yang it's not like just one or the other but nonetheless at some point you ask the
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:27.100]   question do you care about this or do you not care about this as a company and apple when it comes
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:31.100]   accessibility keeps answer the question that yes we do care about this we're going to figure out
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:36.300]   how to do this it's probably similar to the technology that the hand washing detector
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:40.780]   uses it's using multiple sensors listening for sounds of water running and squishing and your
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:46.540]   hands moving in a certain way by the way landmark moment i am going to turn off the hand washing
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:53.740]   timer now because i am sick and tired of washing my hands for 20 seconds i got to talk to Sarah
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.500]   about this a little bit when it launched and she was saying that you know they would hear from
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:01.740]   people in the community who had limb differences or even people who just get injured like you you're
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:06.060]   suffering from an injury you're temporarily requiring and she's like they would use their nose to do
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:10.860]   it is just we got all this feedback we figured how can we how can we help people with these things
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:14.620]   and they go like last year they added that thing with the lidar sensor where it would tell you
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:18.540]   because people were in pandemic lines how close you were to the person in front of you because they
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:22.300]   had no real way of determining that when they were in a store or something so they just they
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.380]   they kind of think about the features and just year after year they knock more and more of these
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:32.700]   things down so cool that's really great that they do that eye tracking support is coming to the
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:40.380]   iPad for third-party eye tracking devices so you will want to get a mfi compatible device
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:45.420]   so that it can track your eyes you can explore images all the nerds think that this is AR like
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:48.860]   they all think that this technology is going to end up in all the AR stuff oh and well it kind of
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:54.060]   leads to watch eye movements right you know that's yeah and move your wrist to control things yeah
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:45:00.620]   apples introducing new features for voice over that's the screen reader that is actually i think
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:09.500]   pretty good on apple stuff now using voice over users can get descriptions of people text table
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:15.900]   data and other objects within images you can navigate the photo over receipt like a table by
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:21.020]   row and column complete with table headers this makes a huge difference because otherwise it's
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.740]   just a bunch of data and a bunch of words all jumbled together so it's really nice to have some
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:32.220]   structure to that voice over there are there's new support for the mfi hearing devices
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:39.020]   program i use my hearing aids with my i phone my ipad and my mom does too and it makes a big
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:45.580]   difference that you can hear audio from now apples adding support for bi-directional hearing aids
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:49.340]   the microphones in the instance the new style i don't have these but there's a new style of hearing
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:53.740]   aids that will let people who are deaf or hard of hearing have hands free phone and face time
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:58.140]   conversations the next generation smart because like we'll be available later this
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.140]   you have to put an air put in as well right you have you have the whole audio system yeah already
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:09.020]   in place yeah but it'll also support audio recognizing audiograms that's the the the chart you get when
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:15.660]   you get a hearing test uh that so now this will be part of the headphone accommodations you can
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:20.780]   customize this is something samsung had that i really loved except in order to use the samsung
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:24.780]   you had to give yourself a hearing test with the phone this this will let you take your hearing
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:34.780]   test from your audiologist import it and then apply it which is amazing uh to your um audio i
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:40.380]   don't i don't it's like an equalizer i guess it is that's that's how the samsung one works so like a
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:46.300]   customizer that's really cool uh apples introducing new background sounds to minimize distractions and
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:54.140]   help you focus stay calm or rest you can have uh bright balanced or dark nose noise as well as
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:47:00.140]   ocean rain or stream sounds play in the background this is great for people with like me with tinnitus
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:07.020]   tinnitus uh having a uh ocean in the background or uh rain in the background can really uh mitigate
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:11.580]   mind at tinnitus it's also people with neurological differences it's like it's like getting a hug
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:16.060]   for your ears yeah it provides a con like something that's predictable because the problem is usually
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:19.340]   the unpredictability of sound it's not because people get confused and say why would you want
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:23.500]   the sound and it's that it is predictable sound that is always there so you're not startled or
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:29.420]   surprised by it and it drowns out the more um what's the word like the the chaos the chaotic sounds
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:34.700]   that you're not prepared for we've had uh family members that wear headphones in a grade school
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:40.860]   for that very reason they can't because it's to all of that noise is uh is distracting coming
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:46.620]   later this year's sound actions for switch control display and text size settings that can be customized
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:54.220]   per app which is fantastic and new customizations from emojis to better represent users with oxygen
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:48:00.140]   tubes cochlear implants and a soft helmet for headwear that's just so i it's wonderful it's
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:05.500]   inclusive i think this is really great yeah thank you apple uh that's really fantastic some really
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.620]   really great stuff so i didn't do this last week i'm i meant to and re-ran at a time but i'm glad
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:20.700]   we could do it uh this week um or you so tell me if this is true i'm gonna be depressed i bought a
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:27.340]   very expensive ipad pro with 16 gigs of ram and now it turns out no app can use more than five gigs
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:34.860]   at any one time for no i mean it's true it's true ish it's one of the things that was just like ipad
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:39.500]   os came from ios and ios is certainly not needed a lot of ram because it doesn't have
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:43.980]   interpretations doesn't have garbage collection and now they've stuck an m1 chip that happens to have
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:49.660]   eight or 16 gigabytes of ram so that's an artificial limit that i'm sure will fall down with the
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:54.460]   yeah the next update this came for now i like i should do procreate because of course if you're
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:49:00.460]   creating a elaborate image with lots of layers you would love to have more than five gigs of ram
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:04.380]   the nice thing right now is that if you're using procreate like i don't think i've had an app
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:08.140]   respawn spawn yet and i've got apps like a week old and i'll go back to them and they're still in
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:13.980]   memory and websites are still in memory and ios has no swap like it has no concept of writing to ssd
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.580]   so all it does is jets in any app that that when it runs out of memory as soon as there's memory
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:21.980]   pressure it jetsums an app so with this it like it doesn't there's no memory pressure doesn't need
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:27.100]   so i've gone back to really heavy apps like like three or four days later they're still in memory
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:31.980]   maybe that's one of the little subtle changes it makes this more usable i can't figure out why but
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:38.700]   i just feel like it's more usable maybe that's that's part of it um so the so ios itself can use
[01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:44.300]   obviously can use five gigs of ram just no one application can it reserves a gig for the system
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:48.140]   and then it makes the rest available but the rest available the top point was six gigabytes before
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:52.540]   so that i don't i never want to say it's like flipping a bit because i think that shows my ignorance
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:56.780]   of software development but it's it's one of those things that i expect will just disappear with the
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:05.820]   next update maybe ios 15 you think well yeah ipados they're still the same but yes again it goes to
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:10.380]   the common complaint that that the ipad is not good enough at multitasking and that's one pain
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:15.820]   point that app can improve and really take it to the next level and the timing is perfect for it to
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:23.340]   be updated you know by the fall at least in an ounce next week so right right right right so i
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:29.180]   don't i won't feel too bad i can't i don't have any apps that need that much ram i'm not saying i
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:34.780]   need to the five gigs comes from the fact that the top of the line ipads only had six gigs until
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:40.460]   this yeah latest one so one gig for that makes sense now one gig for the uh operating system five gigs
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:44.860]   max yeah you know it might have been something as simple as just it's hard coded in which it
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:49.980]   when it shouldn't have been and now it uh that'll change depending on the total available ram
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:55.980]   someday well someone just picks a number and says no one will ever need more than that's famous
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:00.220]   in the computer and you don't ever need more than five computers no ever need more than 128 but
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:03.100]   mega but that's what i'm saying i think it might not have been that it might have been because
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:07.580]   well we know that the most wherever we're gonna ship in an ipad is six gigs yeah we know we want
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:13.020]   one gig for ios so you'll never be able to get more than five gigs so we'll make that the max
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:17.340]   but there's no reason to hard code that you should really say what's the total available ram
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:21.740]   okay let me allocate all of this one yeah exactly i think you could probably figure that out and
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:27.260]   probably fix that so uh very interesting nobody even thought that you would want more than five gigs
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:33.100]   but i bet you procreate another apps photoshop would love you know lumenar would love not lumenar
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:36.860]   but then you're gonna start changing apps again and people will complain all my apps are no longer
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:41.980]   in memory right maybe let us swap right let us swap as well particularly if you're gaming and you
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:47.100]   want to pause a game in the background and then you come back to oh okay that was nice i'm gonna
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:51.660]   have to start that again oh that i wouldn't want well no not not like start the game all over again but
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:55.500]   it means that okay so now instead of being able to remember i thought all i was going to do was to
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:59.740]   was check out check some email and then follow up on a couple of websites but it turns out that now
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:04.620]   i'm gonna have to restart this whole game restart this game and resume from where i was because it
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:11.900]   had to be booted out of memory uh any other stories we want to cover i know this is it's uh
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:19.500]   we're still under two hours i got to keep going is anything else you want to cover before we go to
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:28.300]   our picks of the week speak now or forever hold your peace uh the new wwdc digital lounges are now
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:36.060]   available to sign up i got that notice uh this morning uh there's one-on-one labs i've never
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:40.460]   used these digital digital at the top is that Phil Schiller screaming at the top of that with all the
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:47.660]   where party favors coming out top right with the with the dialogue box is that Phil here with the
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:53.420]   sunglasses or this guy right one of yeah that guy yeah maybe kind of uh Phil Schiller momoji
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:53:01.500]   i guess i have to work on my momoji for wwdc i've got a really kind of thing i you know i i
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:06.860]   re i renewed my attempts to make a momoji of myself after after getting getting the iPad
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:11.980]   they still don't have proper mutton chops you can get sideburns okay you can have like little
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:18.220]   weak ass ones that go to the chin but also but also doom you to oh what i decided not to shave my
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:23.340]   my my mustache or my chin mutton chops these are these are real things they're some of our best
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:28.380]   presidents of ed mutton chops some of our best some of our greatest woodworkers some of our
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:33.340]   i would think about our worst presidents too did milling film or have mutton chops i don't know but
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:38.700]   i wouldn't be surprised apparently this is weird the digital lounges will be in slack
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:49.340]   hmm yeah okay i guess apple uses webex and slack yeah yeah yeah one-on-one labs will be
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:55.100]   available to developers enterprise devs and the student challenge winners ah there you go um
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:54:01.180]   the sign-ups are coming uh the right after the wwdc keynote you can be fairly sure that those
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:07.660]   slacks don't write to the public slack back in i would betcha they have a special their own slack
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:15.900]   back in all right when we come back uh gentlemen prepare your picks of the week our show today
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:23.580]   brought to you by the extremely fresh air in the studio today you know uh like most offices we
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:29.180]   don't have windows that open here and and that's even doubly the case for the studio because we're
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:36.060]   enclosed even more for soundproofing but air quality in office is it's notoriously bad
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:43.180]   uh that's why we use molecules throughout the building we're spending a lot more time indoors
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:47.820]   but did you know indoor air can be up to five times worse than outdoor air and that's according
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:53.740]   to the EPA that's why molecule is reimagining the future of clean air starting with their
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:59.260]   very innovative air purifier developed over 20 years ago by the director of the clean energy
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:04.300]   research center at the University of south florida molecule and i've talked to them by the way
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:09.820]   really nice guy molecules patented photoelectric chemical oxidation technology they call it pico
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:16.700]   p-e-c-o is scientifically proven and you can read the the science uh on the website they've got
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:24.860]   uh independent labs including the department of energies labs at larens berkeley to test this
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:31.420]   stuff it breaks down pollutants to safer molecular components without producing ozone clean indoor
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:35.500]   air is more important than ever the pico technology and molecule meets the performance requirements
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:43.740]   in the fda's guidance for help helping reduce the risk of exposure as a covid-19 virus in health
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:48.780]   care settings it's what you'll see molecules in many dental offices and medical offices
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:54.060]   you still have to wash your hands and you know mask up and all of that but this is a really
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:58.780]   helpful extra layer of virus protection for your spaces molecules technology has been verified
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:04.940]   with rigorous testing from independent third party labs and there's now a big variety to choose
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:10.460]   from i you know you certainly should look at if you're a medical office or a dental office the
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:17.980]   molecule air pro rx that is fda approved five ten k class two medical device to destroy bacteria
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:22.940]   and viruses in the air but it's the same technology is in the molecule air mini that's for smaller
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:29.820]   rooms up to 250 square feet the molecule air 600 square feet the molecule air pro that's the one
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:36.700]   we use in here with with uh covers a thousand square feet they also have the molecule air mini plus
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:42.220]   which is a mini but it has a particle sensor and auto protect mode so it can adjust the fan speed
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:47.500]   based on what's in the air you pick the unit that's best for your space we started our first
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:53.500]   molecule which we purchased we've had in the bedroom for some time and can't live without it
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:57.580]   we got another one for michael so we have two in the house we've had molecules in the studio for a
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:04.060]   couple of years now including this air pro which covers the entire studio and you can tell it makes
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:10.860]   a big difference save up to 150 during molecules limited memorial day sale event visit m-o-l-e-k

[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:05.740]   but i saw this and i signed up for something that looks promising at get big mail dot com if you guys
[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:15.660]   seen this yet it's not out yet but uh i did sign up it is a new way to use email what's nice i noticed
[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:20.380]   it works not not just with gmail which a lot of these do in i-cloud mail but also with my i-map
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:25.580]   provider fast mail another i-map providers but we've been you know for so long we've been trying to
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:31.980]   solve mail that remember hey mail the hey dot com guys which were uh one of the things they did
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:36.460]   which i thought was really cool i didn't end up buying it because it was expensive but they they
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:41.420]   made it so that you you wouldn't have to get mail from anybody until you approved it big mail is
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:46.140]   doing that they call it the bouncer the first time someone emails you they appear in the bouncer
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:52.700]   and then you decide do i want to hear from them ever again that feature alone in hey dot com really
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:59:01.580]   was great they also have a reply later not just reply reply all but reply later which will
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:08.540]   ping you later when it's time to reply and they broke breakdown emails into i do this already with
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:13.820]   a big with a lot of filtration and you know rules but i think that's a lot of work for some people
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.420]   they're going to do this automatically with something they call scenes
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:23.420]   which are basically email categories conversations newsletters purchases notifications
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:28.540]   events and files and i think that's a very good idea and that'll all happen automatically
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:34.460]   especially the newsletter categorization so i haven't got it yet so it's not really a recommendation
[01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:39.100]   except that maybe this would be a good time to sign up right now it's free i don't think it
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:44.940]   will be free forever they're talking about the fact that look our business model aligns with your
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:51.100]   interests because we're going to charge you they don't use a third party server it's direct it's
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:56.860]   basically an email client but and they say try free for seven days i don't know what the what the
[01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:01.900]   in-app purchases will be from but not so big company big mail but i thought this maybe looks
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:09.500]   like it's worth a trial since i get it i will give you a real review of that uh rene richie your pick
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:15.180]   of the week so i i have to be me leo and i think everybody tuning in today you know i'd be
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:19.820]   you know it's gonna be and that is what i've been wearing this whole episode lisa came running
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:28.140]   over to me yesterday and said get me this that is beautiful i think it's their best pride band ever
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:35.340]   you this is just so what is it so i kiff is it fabric what is it made of it's there it's their
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:40.700]   woven oh it is a fabric but it is yeah it is i don't want to say it's an island but it's one of
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:45.180]   those super materials that is you know it doesn't get that saw it gets a little saw you doesn't get
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:50.860]   that soggy i was wearing the plain black version of their woven loop for since it came out and it's
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:55.660]   just been fantastic you do have to get the right size i can i can fit in the six or the seven this
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:01:00.620]   one is the seven so it's not too tight uh but just the colors that they managed to put on it and when
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:06.860]   you combine it with the watch face um it just looks extra they just knock the pride bands out of the
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:12.060]   world like out of the park out of the apple park every year and usually they come out at WWDC and
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:16.220]   i'm able to snag one at the apple store yeah you're totally wtc like as soon as they come out this
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:19.900]   time they they sort of timed it differently so i had to wait for it to arrive but i am so happy with
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:27.020]   them so it kind of more looks like um i help you will forgive me a rag rug but that i love rag
[02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:32.380]   rugs where uh my mom used to make them she would weave together different stripes of color oh and
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:37.260]   there's Lisa it's beautiful yeah Lisa already said gorgeous i'm getting one um it really really
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:42.060]   looks pretty that is that is really i think video in the next spot and you're using now is this a
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:47.420]   special watch new watch pride watch face i because that's yeah they always release a new watch face that
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:52.300]   comes with the matches the bands and this one when you turn your wrist it like you'll see it there
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:58.940]   it kind of kind of animates itself very very nice into the frame which just little nice little touches
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.940]   i might have to get this i i've never gotten one in the fabric watches because of the measurement
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:11.020]   issue yes measure carefully measure measure thrice order once uh but i think i will order this one
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:15.020]   thank you rini good but like Andy said before like they go to the effort of doing these things
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:19.020]   and it goes back to my favorite tim cook moment where the hedge fund was saying why do you waste
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:22.620]   money on accessibility and all these other things and he says he doesn't he doesn't give a damn about
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:27.980]   the bloody ROI and i think that's just my epic tim cook moment does he uh if you're do they don't
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:34.620]   they must donate do they donate some uh portion of the proceeds for this or they just i don't recall
[02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:38.140]   are they having the past and they've they've done a bunch of different and they have their whole
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:42.860]   diversity and inclusivity um program they're doing now for millions and millions of dollars
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:49.100]   that they keep announcing more things too right let me just uh check here wear it with pride put
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:56.140]   the website in the only at apple bradford solo loop only at apple pride edition there's a Nike version
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:01.100]   as well it's 99 bucks they better give some money to somebody jeez louise
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:10.460]   um inspired by the inclusivity combined strength and beauty of pride yes apples proud of sport lg
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:17.980]   b t q advocacy organizations uh including in circle equality north of carolina gender spectrum g l s
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:21.660]   e n level i can go on and on there's put a long list they don't say how much of it is
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:30.700]   donated created by weaving 16 000 recycled polyester yarn filaments around ultra thin silicone threads
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:35.660]   using advanced precision braiding machinery then laser cutting the band to an exact length
[02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:39.340]   for a custom fit no wonder it's 99 bucks it should be 200 dollars
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:44.060]   yeah it's always it always i don't want to sour the no but are always surprising to
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:48.140]   you that a company that can spend three billion dollars chamfering an edge can't put a plug in my
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:51.820]   stupid phone box but they choose to spend their money the way they choose to spend their money
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:56.620]   that's their money to spend the way they wish and they make it of course for 40 and 44 millimeter
[02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:02.060]   but do make sure you measure correctly because these things don't have a buckle or anything they
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:07.660]   either fit or they don't fit there's some stretch to it some give right yeah yeah you can stretch
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:11.980]   quite a bit and the unlike the other um version of the regular loop this one will like you can
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:15.900]   stretch it back into place so i've had one i've been wearing for the last seven months that's
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:20.140]   just a little bit looser than it originally was but it's fine okay then run it through the
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:27.260]   hot dryer it'll shrink it and melt this little band since i'm not frankly does not does not confirm
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:31.660]   deny reports i'm not advocating that Andy and i come here in the week
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:40.220]   uh i came i came late to this puzzle game and now i'm like never survive it it's it's a game
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:47.580]   black box for ios and it's just the most wonderfully creative and beguiling thing i've
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:52.940]   game i've ever encountered it's uh you used to these puzzle games where it's like okay so the
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:58.140]   mechanic is that there's a rope and there and it's attached to pulleys and you have to cut it in the
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:03.100]   right place screen after screen to make sure that the water hits the pail instead of okay i get it
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:08.380]   and it's going to be more complicated no all you get that's consistent is that there are these lights
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:13.820]   that are on the screen and your job is to turn on this light to confirm that you have solved this
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:19.980]   puzzle and at the start they're very very simple that you notice that by tilting the phone by tilting
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:26.140]   the iPad that these waves sort of appear from side to side and that interacts with the light in some
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:34.780]   way and then you get it at later stages you get to things like it's it's it's not a simple mechanic
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:41.500]   each puzzle is kind of unique and some of them are so brilliantly out of the box like you will be at
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:48.380]   what point one point you'll be thinking this can't it oh wow something happened when i when that noise
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:55.500]   happens someplace in the wait a minute i don't have to be making noises that are going to interact with
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:01.340]   this screen are it are am i or i'm not going to have to like cover up the light sensor to make
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:06.700]   something happen to you i'm not going to have to do that stuff oh my god these things happen and
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:12.220]   oh my god and it's like and it came out two or three years ago and it really it almost became
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:16.700]   like a cult-like experience the experience of playing this game it's a lot like one of these like
[02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:22.780]   MIT treasure hunts where again there's there's a puzzle to be solved but you you can't find the
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.940]   answer unless you're going to this street corner at this time at night because that's the only time
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:32.700]   that the street lamp in front of the uh the 18 1888 neko factory tower is lit so you can see
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:37.420]   the order of the lights that are on that tower that's the sort of stuff that this is going at
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:42.140]   where every time you're stuck it's not because gosh i can't figure out okay so if this rope is going
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:47.180]   to up to this pulley then up to this weight but then there's a bird that hits that no it's like
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:51.820]   you have to be very very conscious of what your environment is doing and what your emotions are
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:57.420]   doing it almost never involves tapping anywhere on the screen it's always about like your your
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:03.500]   presence in space and time and your interaction with the device itself uh there are like dozens and
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:08.780]   dozens of levels to this uh the and it's a free game the other thing that's revolutionary about it is
[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:14.380]   that uh it's not it's a free game and it's not like uh electronic arts games where you can't get ahead
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:18.380]   unless you buy hints they will sell you hints if you want to buy hints but if you all you can also
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:24.140]   get hints by recommending but recommending this game to other people and then they wind up downloading
[02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:29.660]   it uh but and even the hints are very very clever and very very satisfying it's the it's the sort of
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:35.340]   puzzle game where you're not getting more and more frustrated as you go on and more and more obsessed
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:41.580]   it's where the rewards are more and more deep and fulfilling where you feel as though my god that
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:46.620]   was i can't believe i spent three days figuring that out but my god what a beautiful solution
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:51.820]   to a puzzle that was well i'm still stuck in the second one so i don't yeah it's
[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:58.300]   this is hard but it's fascinating and they are they are clever in their hint structure and stuff
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:03.420]   so that's cool i haven't played i get before i'm gonna play it now you do feel as though there is an
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:09.340]   actual like person in some sort of a layer somewhere with like a hundred screens around them and they're
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:15.100]   trying to be devil use specifically in turn it's just beautifully beautifully done it's it's
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:20.140]   it's almost like interactive art uh if if there is such a thing and it does say in-app purchases but
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:25.500]   that's for an additional puzzle pack which is 4.99 but you can buy you can buy you can buy hints you
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:30.460]   can buy additional puzzles you do not require to you don't have to buy anything else to make it work
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:37.420]   even as a fact the creator put this post on medium explaining what his intent was and how he decided
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:42.380]   that this is way to work and i think it actually did win an apple design award the year came out
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:50.300]   like 2017 or 2018 oh i get it i have to go underneath it yeah exactly i see i see i see i only see i
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:55.820]   only got that one so quickly because i happen to be in bed like with my new ipad there's like
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:09:00.940]   actually using it like this and i would never have gotten it had i realized oh wow i'm actually
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:06.460]   using it upside down does this work on the ipad as well or is it yep yep it works without any
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:12.860]   change whatsoever yeah nice thank you Andy you've just ruined my life uh thank you but just your
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:18.380]   goal i know at every possible juncture it's part of my core competency you did read my cv when i first
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:24.780]   applied for for podcasting work Andy will take up all of your free time with games and amusements
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:30.860]   you cannot put down you will you'll regret meeting him you will regret doubly hiring him in any
[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:36.380]   new degree of responsibility and yet you will not be able to sever your connection because he is
[02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:41.980]   just that beguiling that's right you have beguiled me uh somebody in our chatroom
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:48.380]   thread 34 66 says it's one of the greatest ways to learn what your phone can do i finished all 79
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:58.700]   levels it's great then now it's time to spend money with Alex Lindsay's pick of the week
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:05.100]   oh he's muted i'm he's the invisible Alex Lindsay go ahead
[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:14.300]   go ahead yeah hear me now yeah okay um so uh so that what i'm recommending is called isadora and i
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:18.380]   wanted to recommend partially because i didn't even know it existed until like three or four months
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:26.540]   ago and it's been around for years and so um and and it's um uh it's it was created by mark
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:32.060]   kenniglio who is a uh he's a performance artist or he works in in these different performances
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:36.140]   and for a long time you know he's been he's been really part of a lot of the breaking you know
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:40.220]   stuff that in the eighties and nineties and he wrote this to fix the problem of when you're on
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:45.580]   stage being able to control the lights and control the playback and control uh audio and video and
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:49.340]   have them all integrated and have them all cueable and have them all you know talking to each other
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:57.900]   and we've begun to use it actually for zoom because uh liminal has uh Andy Karluciot liminal
[02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:06.140]   has been able to tie information from zoom into isadora to control windows and graphics and
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:10.700]   everything else online and virtually and so but when i started digging into it we're going to have
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:15.580]   actually mark is going to come on an office hours on friday and uh and talk about it but as like i
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:21.660]   talked to him last week and i was just really amazed at at what's possible so really and and then
[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:25.900]   of course i talk to people in theater and they're like uh yeah it's it'd be like walking up to
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:31.660]   someone who works in print and go have you heard a photoshop yeah like it's like yeah yeah we have
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:37.180]   heard of that and so um yeah and everybody uses it so it's a really if you're if you're looking for
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:43.020]   something like that again the it what it does is it maps inputs and outputs really effectively
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:47.660]   and it includes the ability to um you know control things you know outside of it so you can say i
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.860]   want to have that when this information comes in i want to remap it and have it go do this it's it's
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:59.500]   um it's a really powerful server system that can help lots of different kinds of hardware and
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:05.660]   software interact with each other um whether it's dmx or osc or for all of the different boxes that
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:10.140]   you use in uh yeah and it's and it's not designed to be a you know a lot of us can i'm not a lot of
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:15.180]   us but people can do this with programming what this was really written by as an artist you know
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:20.300]   so this is all very visual so you can tie things together and say okay well now i want to do this
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:25.500]   and have it go this way and so and it was really what's great about it is is that it comes from
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:29.660]   where the great apps come from which is someone trying to solve their own problem right you know
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:35.900]   years ago and this is again brand new to me only three months ago but it's been around for 20 years
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:40.300]   you know and so it's it's something that has been building up in the theater business for and
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:44.780]   performance business for years and it's really a kind of a mainstay for a lot of these things but
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:51.180]   but uh i had never heard of it before it's a switcher but not just for cameras for everything
[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:56.940]   well it's it's yeah it's a data audio transport system yeah you can say when i hit when i hear
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:00.620]   when i get this information from over here i want you to go do this over here so you can
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:06.220]   grab this stuff you can well that's the whole thing is tying it all in and it can also tie into cues
[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:10.940]   from your stream deck from buttons that you created from people being in a certain place from people
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:16.380]   talking in zoom like like all of those things can be uh automated and say well when you see this
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:21.100]   information i want you to go do these other things and but you know and we think about automation
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:27.020]   tools but this is really built to talk to all the things that you would need again in the area of
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:32.860]   things like dmx and osc and and lots of other controllers and being able to reach out and and
[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:39.340]   make all those work so it's a it's a you know really uh really powerful application and and
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:45.180]   again i was amazed that i that it was so powerful and that i hadn't i hadn't used it so or hadn't
[02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:51.900]   heard about it so interesting a licensing situation too you can subscribe for 150 a year or 1750 a
[02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:58.460]   month or you can rent it for a week for 10 bucks or even that you do that outright for 550 bucks
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:03.340]   which is really interesting i think yeah and smart i think you know it's it's reacting to the to the
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:07.740]   market so you know a lot of times you may have you have an event that's going to happen for the next
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.740]   week and you want to rent it right you know or you know so you know i just want to rent it because i
[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:16.140]   i already know how to use it but i need a custom one for this so i'm going to bring something that's
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:21.420]   already largely pre-built right and but i need i need an actual copy and so i only but i only
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:27.900]   yeah because you could learn it in one week probably no yeah yeah yeah and and i believe and i can't
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:32.220]   remember i i have to look back at it but i believe that it that you can use it as much as you want
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:37.900]   to just won't save so you can kind of like work with it and figure it out um you know and see how
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:41.260]   those things work i believe that's i've been dealing with so many of these recently that
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:46.620]   these automation tools that i can't remember which ones had which rules but but the um but i believe
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:51.180]   that that it's there there is a fair number of things you can do with it just in the demo and i
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:54.540]   may be inaccurate about that because there's another one that's similar to this that i have
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:58.940]   been playing with as well but and it doesn't say it on the website here but it is this is just such a
[02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:05.900]   you know incredible tool to tie all this stuff together and we've been using it again for things
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:11.340]   like zoom where it's taking information from zoom using zoom osc which is what liminal makes
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:16.380]   and then passing that information into isadora and then passing you know more you know information
[02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:21.820]   and queuing graphics and so on so forth with it is he german or he just lives in german he's
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:27.660]   no he's from the u_s yeah he's um i just talked to him he's he's in aust or when i talked to him he was
[02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:33.900]   uh he's in austria i think right now but but he uh but he's from the u.s i can't remember the
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:40.460]   but he's company trica tronix is in berlin yeah yeah so and he's and again if if anyone you know
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:45.020]   we're gonna interview him um when office hours on friday uh because it's you know it just was
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:50.700]   really fascinating what he's doing but it's a really cool application so isadora from trica
[02:15:50.700 --> 02:16:01.420]   tronix at trica tronix dot com and by the way that's a good uh introduction to office hours which
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:09.100]   is pretty much a 24/7 operation these days soon you know we are we're we we are uh we maybe is 24/7
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:13.900]   i was only joking a little bit we're not yeah yeah we're we're the show itself will only be a
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:18.220]   couple hours there's no reason to turn off the cameras just keep going well the funny thing is
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:21.900]   is that when i'm not there it's actually there's so many great people that are in the community
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:26.220]   now that we have this pre-show and a post-show that happens you know in the post-show i'm never in
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:29.900]   and the pre-show i kind of check in and then i go make breakfast and stuff like that and it's
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:32.700]   so much fun to listen to i can't even not listen i'm listening to everybody else
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:37.180]   talking about problem-solving and figuring stuff out and and working through things and so
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:42.780]   um when i'm not there now i have my own fomo of the rest of the community you know it's not about
[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:46.220]   me anymore it's it's like i'm like they're gonna talk about something important and i'm i'm not
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:51.500]   gonna be there so i i have my phone i log in i listen to the listen to everyone talking and we
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:55.900]   are talking about the idea that we probably should just run it run the kind of the slow going all
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:17:01.660]   a slow version all the time can you leave zoom on 24/7 no you can't you guys switch it i think it's
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:05.500]   out of the 24/36 hours you have to flip a new one but i mean you just have to read i have to do
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:13.500]   is close it and open it but the um but uh uh one of the things that we are oh the show itself office
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:17.820]   hours is about to become something that looks a lot more like a show so in fact if you want to
[02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:23.580]   watch us create that that that show like experience over yes uh today or yesterday we started talking
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:30.380]   about it um today and tomorrow and thursday we've been like really figuring it out and we're doing a
[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:35.020]   really complex version of it because our version of zoom is like you know it's 10 breakout rooms and
[02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:39.340]   there's different people on each one and and there's all this very complex audio and comms and
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:43.180]   there's people all over the world working on it at one time and so if you want to see how that
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:48.060]   what that looks like the next couple days will be interesting um and then uh and then we're gonna
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:53.820]   start we're gonna do more and more of these kind of shows around events uh wwc being one of the first
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.500]   ones where we've done some a couple things around kenotes before but this one's gonna be the first
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:03.580]   one we're really designing a show around it um and so we're looking at nab and ibc and other ones
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:10.060]   the seagraff and things like that where we kind of um you know bring people in so like monday evening
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:15.340]   we'll have uh developers coming in that are going to talk about you know how those how the developer
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:20.460]   announcements impact them you know and and so and taking questions the big thing about office hours
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:24.700]   is there's no there's no show show just we show up and we go okay what are your questions
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:31.500]   so so that's a it's a different kind of uh different kind of show so anyway very cool if you want to
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:37.660]   probably best way to sample it is to go to youtube.com/alexlindsey where they put the recorded versions
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:42.860]   of office hours which is just a small fraction of the total but you can at least say two hours a day
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:49.660]   yeah and then and then there's a link to with the office hours uh zoom invite yeah it's uh and you
[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:54.460]   can now join if you want to sign up or if you want to if you're interested in the wwc one you can go
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:59.340]   to office hours dot global which will be uh the website that'll keep on building up that
[02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:04.540]   nice over time office hours dot global we'll start putting that in under under your name of course
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:11.100]   follow Alex on on twitter a-l-e-x-l-i-n-d-s-a-y because that's a great place to figure out
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:17.340]   what the hell is going on and Alex always likes sometimes sometimes and sometimes we'll talk about
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:23.500]   honey uh sometimes just honey it's just honey by the end of 2021 you'll have registered as a
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:28.860]   place of worship for tax purposes by the end of 2022 you're gonna have your own compound yeah by
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:34.940]   20-1 he's gonna have his own planet i think the you know we have uh we the 501c3 is in process so
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:40.940]   we should be an actual yeah we should be an actual uh that's non-profit within the next month or two
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:49.100]   yeah uh the breadth and width of the ca the topics you cover is kind of mind boggling uh but you've
[02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:52.700]   got to export to everything so it's faster now that's the whole thing is that it's not i learn
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:57.900]   as much every day as as everybody else does i mean there's people here that we talked about um uh
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:05.420]   fine-tuning and uh and uh you know last yet last we got in um anyway uh i don't know well-tempered

[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:14.780]   fascinating yeah and but it was like it wasn't it was like six people that just knew everything
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:18.620]   about it and then the rest of us just kind of learning from them and so each one of these things
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:24.540]   digs in uh the especially yeah it's amazing how deep some of the questions the answers get
[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:27.980]   people ask these questions every day every single day congratulations i mean you've really
