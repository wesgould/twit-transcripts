[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and the Alex and Renee are here. There is news.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.800]   The new studio display finally gets the update we've been waiting for.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.800]   Micah Sargent will demonstrate the new look camera.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   We'll also talk about the future of Twitter, of course, and all the rumors about the iPhone 14.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000]   It's just around the corner. So is Mac Break Weekly next.

[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple and I am assured
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   that there is news from Apple.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   We'll see.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   Alex Lindsey is here from all.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   He's taking a break from office hours.global.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   The 24/7 Sabado Gigante.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   How's it going?
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   We recovered NAB yesterday and we just went to start.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   It started on Saturday, I think.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   It started Saturday and then the Expo I think opened on Sunday.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   And we just had some folks that a couple of weeks before decided,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   "Hey, we're just going to go and cover it."
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   And so office hours ran I think for three extra hours or four extra hours yesterday.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   And they just roamed around and showed us stuff that was there and some of it was great
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   and some of it was a little rough.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   But the funny thing is I got a comment from someone saying, "Yeah, it's a little rougher
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   on the edges."
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   But it's better than everybody else's stream.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   It's more interesting.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   There's a bunch of geeks out and talking about it content wise.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   It was great.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   But it's like a team of 20 people around the world running this whole show.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   So we're already warming up for the next one.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   It was a huge success.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   And we will be querying you later on highlights so that those of us who don't want to watch
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   an eight-hour presentation can just get the five-minute Pre-C.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Eddie Inaco is also here speaking of Pre-C.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   He is precious.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   He is at WGBH in Boston and is a regular right here.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   Hello, I've been called Precious in quite a while.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   Precious.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   My Precious.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   And Renee Ritchie is here, which is a good thing because -- YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie -- there
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   is a breakthrough in the Apple Studio Display firmware.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   And I know about it because Renee tweeted it moments ago.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   An update to the studio display firmware is now available with today's beta release of
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   Mac OS Monterey 12.4.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   This beta update has refinements to the studio display camera tuning, including improved
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   noise reduction, contested framing.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   So -- Yes, yes.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   Have you installed it already?
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   I couldn't because it would have stopped me doing the show.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   No, go ahead.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   You have to go through a microgram roll.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   No, go ahead.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Do it right now.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   You have to have the beta -- I don't have the beta running on my production machine, so
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   I'd have to get a Mac that has the beta on it and then update the beta of Mac OS and then
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   update the studio display.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Yeah, it was a little bit -- I would have done it if it was just like a couple of button
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   points.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I know who could do it.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Micah Sargent has the studio display.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   He's sitting at home with nothing to do just watching this show.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   Micah, why don't you do it and then you could call in and show us the brand new look on
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   the camera.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   No one said -- it looks like no one's had time to actually install it yet, but Apple confirmed
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   to the verge that the main thrust of this is to fix both the quality of the camera and
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   the quality of center stage and how well it tracks and follows people.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   So essentially it's this thing that we promised you wouldn't suck, but now suck less.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   My only request is that there's a headroom.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   I just need a headroom slide.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   Like less headroom.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Oh, yeah, the center stage always puts you.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   The stage is going to -- is it what it's doing?
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   I guess center is it, but it's like --
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   It's like why we're down here.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Yeah, I mean, it's always -- it's always -- when they say center stage, they mean center stage?
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   It's like the center of the -- I know because I use it to -- I use my iPad Pro to talk to
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   my mom, and I'm constantly tilting it forward, and then it slides me back down.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   Those were -- those were -- those were -- so frustrating.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   But once they were done with the verge, I got to speak to them very briefly as well.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   My takeaway, the my total extrapolation, not putting on them, is that it has got the same
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   hardware and the same software as the -- and the same chipset as the iPad 9, and it was
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   finally going to behave as though it has the same camera and the same chipset and the same
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   software as the iPad 9.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   So it's kind of pretty good.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Right.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   Yeah, it was buggy in that what it was doing was overexplo -- like it basically wasn't allowing
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   any contouring, any -- like what they call contrast, it was just image stacking all the
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   shadows away, all the highlights away, so you looked completely flat, and it's fixing
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   that.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   It was similar to the fix, I believe, with the iPhone XS when that first came out, and we
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   had, like, smooth gate where everyone felt like they were beauty filtering them, but
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   it was really --
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   Here's -- here's the example from NELI Patel's initial review of it.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   You can see how soft it is.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   In fact, it's so soft it makes that model 3 on its shelf look like a cyber truck.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   It's that bad.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   Yes.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   So -- yes.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   So we'll see -- NELI, I'm sure, we'll post updates.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   You have to have the beta of Monterey on your system.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   Is that right?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Yes.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.040]   And then you can update your display by going to software update.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.840]   You'll get firmware version 15.5.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.720]   And then if anybody in the audience does it, go to irc.twit.tv or go into our Discord
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.240]   and say, "I did it.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   Let me show you."
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.080]   And you can give us some pictures because I'd love before the show's over.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.920]   And God knows you have five or six hours before the show's over.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   I would love it if you --
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   I'm not an office hours, Leo.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   I mean --
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   Oh.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   Only two.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   We do have more viewers than CNN plus.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   We're not office hours.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.920]   Holy cow, who doesn't, right?
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   Who doesn't?
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   So --
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.360]   Makes us the lighting problem, but I hear that now everybody gets a synthetic dueling
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   scar.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.520]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.920]   Just a little dany cheek, you know?
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.560]   And they totally could.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.440]   You know, this is an Apple show and we're going to talk 99.9% about Apple.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.040]   Oh, wait a minute, the public Mac OS beta is not out yet.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.080]   Oh, Micah says he's downloading it because he must have the dev version.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.600]   Okay.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.160]   I would not be surprised if they front load as many of the betas as possible just to get
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.560]   people in trying this out.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   So they just keep checking.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   So, Mr. Micah Sargent --
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   And all the betas are out too.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   Thank you, sir.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   He's taking a big chance.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.480]   He's putting the beta on his beautiful new Mac studio.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   And he's going to --
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   Good looking person.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   So, like, if this does badly by him, it's going to be our mom.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   That's a good point.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   You know, he's not like us.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.800]   That's a good point.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.880]   He's almost as good looking as Neil I Patel, so --
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.880]   Oh, he's way -- come on, yeah.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.640]   I was going to scale it like Micah's a good 10 above most of us humans.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.740]   I agree.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.320]   We went to the butter and eggs day parade together on Saturday.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.320]   Micah and I.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   People spoon.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   Like he walked.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   They did.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   He got all the attention.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.920]   Standing next to him.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.080]   Last week, that fellow from the roto-gravuer was tailing his butt all the way through that
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   Easter parade.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.680]   Made the rest of us who put just as much effort into what feel like we've been sliding for
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   a minute.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   Smile for the bird, A.M.S.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.680]   Sergeant.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.040]   I'd like to put your image into tomorrow's bulletin.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   All right.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.120]   Since we are going to talk more about Apple stuff, and we will, I hope before the end of
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   the show have some images from the update, may I indulge you because I'm just dying to
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.200]   ask everybody I see on the street.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.800]   What do you think?
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.400]   I was all week last week saying, oh, Elon doesn't want Twitter.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.760]   Why would he want Twitter?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.680]   He's either trolling us or pumping and dumping so he can make more money on his stock.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.000]   And lo and behold, over the weekend, Elon Musk buys Twitter.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.320]   You think he bake, bought Twitter?
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   Is that what you're saying, Leo?
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.120]   Like he just like, he's like, I'm going to buy Twitter.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   Oh, no, I bought Twitter.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.260]   It was, you know, it was the fact that he said that he said last week that his, his
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.560]   one and only offer ended in 420 on the week of 420.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.080]   That's okay.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.920]   Elon got bored and you wanted a little bit, you can see what was happening.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.040]   You wanted some more attention cookies.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.160]   But yeah, but now yesterday it's like, oh, I'll be damned.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.600]   He the bastard actually managed to actually successfully put in that bid.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.040]   Do we think he can make, he's spent spending what?
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.640]   $43 billion.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.640]   Do we think he can?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   He can.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   He's taking it private.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.620]   All the shareholders will get $54.20 per share.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.860]   No equity for employees with stock options though.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.700]   Well, yeah, the stock options, they say will continue to vest over the roughly six months.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.420]   It'll take to close the deal.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.420]   But at that point, what you got to sell it before you turn off the lights that night.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.100]   I think that's probably the biggest challenge that he has is maintaining his hand, is maintaining
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.780]   his employees because they're compensated with options.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.220]   Yeah, in the Bay Area, you either have to pay people a lot more or you have to give them
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220]   stock options.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.940]   A lot of people may become mobile pretty quickly.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.620]   That's going to be a problem for him.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.020]   I think that there are places that he could, I think that there's some stuff you could
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.060]   do to Twitter that would make it better to read.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.980]   I don't know if it would make a better business, but I think that he's talked about confirming
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.500]   every post is done by a human, which will drive some people crazy.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   I think that he may close up a lot of the APIs and automatic stuff that Twitter does because
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.980]   that makes it easier for bots to get in.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.660]   I think that there are some things like, I personally think that I've often said that
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.980]   I think they should put two-factor authentication on every tweet.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.540]   Like, hey, you really want to tweet?
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.940]   Probably good for people who were drunk tweeting because they would be able to figure out how
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.700]   to make it work.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:05.180]   I think that making it a little adding friction I think would probably improve the conversation
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.180]   though it may not be a good business model.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.780]   Yeah, he may not care.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.100]   He may just say, "Well, I'm going to own it.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.500]   I'm not going to make any money on it."
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.700]   That's $43 billion down the drain.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.580]   But now I can make Twitter what I always wanted to do.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.340]   But the problem is it's not $23 billion down the drain.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.340]   There is a run cost.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.340]   Oh, yeah, that.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.340]   So it's a private buy-out.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.180]   You do have an overhead to it.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:34.020]   But it could be a good thing if it means that he's willing to run it at a loss, so
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.700]   it's a manageable loss.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.060]   He wants to make revenue from it.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:46.460]   But it's okay if it's not performing at the level where it would be pleasing stockholders.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.860]   Because Twitter has not been making any money whatsoever, which means that at some point
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.180]   it was going to be attractive to a company like, "Hey, how about Time Warner?
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.340]   Let's make it the latest.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.340]   Hey, or Google will say, "Hey, we've got a great plan for Twitter."
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.380]   Or Microsoft, all these copies that will buy something, thinking that it will give them
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.420]   something that they're missing, but they will then put their own management on it,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.660]   try to turn it to something that it isn't, run it to the ground, then wind up selling
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.580]   it for parts for like $8 million for people who just want all the data that's been collected
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.580]   from it.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.740]   If I'm worried that he doesn't understand what content, how important content moderation
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:32.300]   is, that what he calls restrictions to free speech is actually just what we've learned
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:38.260]   in the past 10 years about the danger and the contamination that happens when you have
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.820]   no rules on what you can say and how you can say it and how long you can get away with it.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.540]   Mike Masnick had a great takedown before he bought it on Friday.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.660]   Elon Musk demonstrates how little he understands about content moderation, which he basically
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.780]   says, "Elon's going to throw out everything that Twitter's learned over the last 15 years,
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.700]   start with the same plan that they started with originally, and it's going to be a disaster."
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.620]   I mean, I see a lot of people with hair on fire saying it's going to be a disaster.
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.780]   I mean, I'm willing to watch and see.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.300]   It'll be an interesting garbage fire.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.300]   It always has been.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   It's interesting, frankly.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.860]   It's interesting to me because like he's pinning this, he said like he doesn't care,
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.140]   like he's going to take it private, making money off it is not important to him.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.180]   He believes that free speech is fundamental to democracy, which is a throwaway line because
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.420]   he's not a dumb person.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.220]   Well, he's also talking about space that's a ton of Tesla.
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.820]   No real champion of free speech.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.820]   Let's put that out.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:33.420]   Which is very, but either he doesn't understand what it means, and I don't think he's dumb
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.740]   enough to not understand what it means because when you press him, he'll say, "Yes, I understand
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.260]   that the speech has a small amount of different countries."
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.580]   Here's what Mike Masik says.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:45.380]   He says, "You can say free speech as long as it breaks the law, but I don't want spam."
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.180]   He says, "That's directly contradictory.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.900]   Spam does not break the law."
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.180]   Which is why the telephone companies have to allow spam calls because there's a first
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.740]   amendment in the United States.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:01.180]   In this one interview he did with Chris Anderson at Ted, he says, "Completely contradictory
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.180]   proposals."
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.660]   No spam and free speech.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.620]   So Mike can say about that.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.900]   Mike can say about that is he's demonstrated that he's not dumb about it, that he does
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.380]   understand the nuances when pressed.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.740]   So that feels like it's just something cool, like a meme that you say to your friends
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.580]   to get clout on Twitter.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.460]   And then the other part of it where he says, "Open source and algorithms was transparent."
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   That's not how that works.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.700]   You could just publish the algorithm.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.700]   It doesn't have to be open source or not.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.620]   You could do that in a second.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.100]   So that just seems like another really weird meme lord thing to say.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.100]   And none of that is serious.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.100]   It sounds good.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.100]   And then Andy said the anonymous, no more anonymous accounts.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.960]   EFF takes that one on saying, besides the fact that, and I don't think you have to have
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.540]   anonymous accounts on Twitter, but somewhere you have to have anonymous speech to protect
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.140]   users that don't align with those in power.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.580]   And the EFF says, and this is I think the important paragraph, there's little evidence
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.460]   that requiring people to post using their real names creates a more civil environment
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.860]   and plenty of evidence that you're doing so connect disastrous consequences for some
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.580]   of the most vulnerable users.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.340]   I think that there's a valid reason to have anonymous posts.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:15.380]   So I think that absolutely for whistleblowers, for a whole variety of reasons, but they're
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.540]   fundamentally wrong in saying that it doesn't make a more civil speech.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.540]   Absolutely.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.260]   I've worked with engineering teams talking about this.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.620]   When you give people real names and you say that they're really who they are, it absolutely
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.260]   changes the entire flavor of the conversation.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.340]   Well, to some degree, but it is.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.660]   It absolutely doesn't work on Facebook.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.140]   It was plenty of people who are willing to say bad things on their own name.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.140]   But look at how many negative things are in LinkedIn.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.140]   Very few, only crazy people do that because they're actually accountable for it.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.540]   It's whether people think it's important or not.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.020]   No, it is an important thing.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.260]   There's a lot of variables in this calculus.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:02.100]   And one of them is, as you say, when people use their real names and it's a verified name,
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.380]   it does lead to people being a lot more cogent, a lot more thoughtful about the repercussions
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.140]   about what they're saying.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:16.700]   However, we also know that there are so many different categories of people that if they
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:25.300]   were forced to speak out under their own names, not only their political lives are in danger,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:31.460]   their physical lives are in danger, all the way from people who are enemies of a certain
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.340]   government or perceived enemies of a government to just people who don't want their parents
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.860]   to know that they're gay or that they're trans.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:46.140]   It's a complicated thing that I have more faith in 18 that's been doing this for 10
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.180]   years than in somebody who says, "I've had it with this, right check, right check, right
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.180]   check."
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.180]   There we go.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.060]   I'm going to solve everything by making this the most free speech.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.100]   Yes, we don't know what he's going to do yet, but I'm hoping that he doesn't.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.340]   I'm hoping that he takes the advice of people who have been doing this for 10 years, who
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.580]   have been running Twitter specifically for 10 years, and they understand that there are
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.220]   reasons why we threw Trump's butt off of this service and we're not inviting him back.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:18.860]   I really liked the quote that they put in the PR release from Twitter.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.380]   At first glance I went, "Oh, yeah, that's great.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.380]   All of that's great.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.340]   It's only when you dig deep that you see that there are problems."
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.340]   This is what he said.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.940]   "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.940]   Check.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.020]   Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity or debated.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.020]   Check."
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.620]   I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.100]   – good, making the algorithms open source to increase trust.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:51.340]   Initially, that sounds good, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.100]   "Oh, that sounds great until you start to dig."
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.980]   This is the problem is these are exactly the things that Jack Dorsey said when he founded
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.260]   Twitter and have Williams when they founded Twitter, when Mark Zuckerberg found Facebook.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.060]   These are the words that's taking a page from Mike Massey's book, the Silicon Valley
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.660]   said when they launched these social networks, "Here we are a decade and a half later.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.660]   It ain't that easy.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.660]   It's on fire."
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.380]   Yeah, and I want to clarify that.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.180]   I'm not saying that we shouldn't have anonymous accounts.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.940]   I'm just saying that the statement of that it doesn't prove to it.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.860]   The first thing we do when we put on a forum, if I'm brought into engineer something, it's
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.820]   immediately real names.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.500]   We just immediately turn that on because I'm not trying to be the town square.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.900]   I'm trying to have this conversation go well.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.780]   We've known that for two decades, that you put real names in there and you attach them
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:49.260]   specifically to real IDs and you absolutely have a cleaner conversation.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.420]   I was just talking about that's not valid as them saying there's no research.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.660]   I don't know if there's any academic research.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.300]   Oh, there's a ton of it.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.300]   I don't understand it.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.260]   This is the best known.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.380]   This is Nathan Matthias, the real name fallacy.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.660]   I'll give you some links.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.660]   I'm not sure.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.500]   I don't really care what researchers think.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.620]   I'm just saying to someone who builds these for the last 20 years, I can tell you that
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.060]   there's an absolute connection to real names.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.740]   I'm not saying that that's what we should do.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.580]   I'm just saying that everybody who does this knows that you put real names in there.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.380]   So I'll give you some stats.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.660]   Your environment, it may be more important, I think, Alex, than the real name thing.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.900]   I'll give you some stats.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.900]   Roughly half of all US adult victims of online harassment already know who their attacker
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.700]   is.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.340]   That's a fact.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.340]   So I'm not talking about attackers.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.580]   I'm just talking about conversation.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.820]   But online harassment is one of the reasons why you want to have real names.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.740]   That's what I think is right.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.380]   Identity protections, the first line of defense for people who face serious risks online,
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.300]   requirements of so-called real names misunderstand how people manage identity across multiple
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.300]   social contexts.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.300]   I can give you the whole thing.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   You should read the article.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.860]   I understand you're empirically saying that that's worked.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.900]   In fact, I agree with you.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:11.100]   I don't enforce real names on the chatroom, on Twitter forums, or on our Mastodon, because
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.540]   I think people like handles, they like using handles, and there are lots of good reasons
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.860]   to use handles.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.380]   What we do enforce is rules.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.780]   Because it's a small-scale operation, we can moderate it.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.740]   So we don't have those problems on those three platforms due to moderation, not because they're
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.540]   using real names or not using real names.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.620]   Requiring real names, I decided against it for these reasons.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.660]   Requiring real names on any of these platforms doesn't necessarily make it better and definitely
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.060]   makes it worse.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.860]   Now you're not doing a public platform.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.180]   You're talking about office hours.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.540]   You're talking about other things.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.540]   And I agree with you.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.220]   And I think it's the environment as much and the social norms as much on your places.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.380]   By the way, social norms are super important.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:57.140]   We don't have to moderate very much on the forums or on Mastodon because of the norms,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.240]   the environment.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.140]   People will really shout you down if you start acting like a jerk.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.340]   I do think, though, that, I mean, again, in discussions with lots of teams that build
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:12.340]   these things, we've definitely found that that calms the conversation pretty quickly.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.220]   It depends on how much leverage there is.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.780]   So for instance, LinkedIn has probably the most leverage.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.780]   And you see almost no-
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.700]   Because your employer is looking at what you post.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.860]   No, not just your employer, your potential future employer and your potential.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.860]   And the mistake people make is actually--
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.820]   Twitter wouldn't have that benefit necessarily, right?
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.820]   Yeah, no.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.820]   I'm not saying that they do.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.660]   I'm just saying-- I just think it's funny when people say that that's the case because
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.820]   all of us that do this for a living know that real names make a huge difference in what
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:46.660]   we do and real IDs and everything else definitely change the tenor of everything that's going
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.660]   on.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.860]   But I'm not saying that I don't think Twitter could do it because everyone's got all these
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860]   handles now.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   I don't know how he would do that.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.740]   I put my own name in everything.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.740]   I do too.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.540]   Here's what he'll do is he'll say, "Well, we're going to have a check mark for people
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.900]   who are authenticated."
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.540]   And then you don't have to follow anybody who's unauthenticated.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.780]   I know from experience not following somebody who's harassing you doesn't help the problem
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.780]   at all.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.340]   Can we just look at this one?
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.820]   And you're lying like this is too big.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.780]   He's taking on something that is-- because a lot of people who've spoken out say that
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.780]   this has ended them.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.260]   Zuckerberg apparently meditates in the morning.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.860]   All those-- I wish Elon would stick to the things that are changing the world for the
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.860]   better.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.860]   Like Tesla and SpaceX.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.420]   Like, the Cybertruck and the Roadster.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.580]   How much further does this push the Cybertruck and the Roadster down the road?
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.580]   He may be bored with that.
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.580]   I don't know.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.900]   People are saying-- Walter Isaacson, who is, of course, the oligarch's favorite biographer,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:46.660]   pointed out that he was taking a 10 p.m. engineering meeting at SpaceX last night after announcing
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.740]   the takeover of Twitter.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.020]   Great, wonderful.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:59.260]   But that points out another potential sticky spot where his life is not Twitter.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.380]   Zuckerberg's life is Facebook.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.180]   He doesn't have all these other commitments.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:08.700]   He doesn't have all these other huge corporations that he's trying to promote and trying to keep
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.140]   running and to keep expanding.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.980]   What happens if Elon Musk decides that, hey, I know that Republicans are really upset with
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.660]   Twitter because they think that conservative speech is being censored.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:28.580]   I can really get a lot of friends inside Congress if I were to give them some privileges that--
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.660]   if we were to say, oh, yeah, the old guard, the old algorithm was definitely-- oh, you're
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.980]   absolutely right about this.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.020]   And don't worry, we're going to be making sure the conservative voices are going to be
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.460]   not only not censored but promoted.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.300]   And what if--
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   Or China.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.300]   Chinese Communist Party.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:50.940]   China's Communist Party has been known already to be trying to influence world conversations
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.020]   to make sure that the messaging that they have about what's happening inside their country
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.980]   is happening inside movies, inside social media, inside everywhere.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.420]   What happens when Elon either on his own initiative thinks that, hey, the friendlier relationship
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.020]   that Twitter has with China to meet their goals, the easier it's going to be for me to
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.860]   say, hey, look, we're all friends here.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.540]   Why don't you let me put a couple more tests of plants here?
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:22.540]   Why don't you put me in priority for manufacturing resources here or there?
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.420]   There are a lot of things we're going to have to figure out.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.700]   We're going to have to discover rather as things play out, as we're--
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.700]   Well, if he gets mad at the phone.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.700]   Do anything but observe.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.340]   He's gotten mad at the past and said, like, he loves free speech, but he's like, oh, you
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.020]   complained about the Tesla, so I'm canceling your order.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.020]   Let's talk about--
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.620]   That's anonymous with free speech.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.220]   Let's talk about the labor issues inside Tesla.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:47.300]   Let's also talking about racism inside employee relations inside Tesla.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300]   I have to laugh.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.140]   Let's talk about panel gaps inside an $80,000 car.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.900]   You'll see whatever you're saying.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.180]   We're moving your Twitter account right now.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:01.740]   I had to laugh when Jeff Bezos tweets, well, Elon's going to have trouble with China on
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   Twitter.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:09.900]   And then people pointed out, Jeff, half of these stuff sold on Amazon, sold to China.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.940]   You agreed to ban negative reviews of Premier Xi's book in China.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.780]   Jeff, you're probably not the person to be talking about this.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.260]   And he owns The Washington Post, right?
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.220]   All the stuff is owned by a cadre of--
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.140]   They had a list of the 10 richest people and they all own everything we used to communicate
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.140]   with them all day.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.140]   Guess what?
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.380]   If you're an oligarch-- and by the way, I have decided to call them oligarchs from no
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.380]   one.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.980]   Oligarchs, not billionaires.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.180]   Oligarchs, let's call them a spade of spade.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:40.780]   If you're an oligarch, you want to control the-- what do you call it?
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.820]   The crossroads of America.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.260]   You want to control that.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.300]   That's where your reputation lives.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.340]   Of course, and if you can afford it, buy it.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.700]   Anyway, I don't want to take over the show with this easily could.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.340]   We'll do this tomorrow on Twig.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.340]   We'll take over the show with it.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.340]   I guarantee you.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.580]   That's all we'll be talking about tomorrow.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.700]   It's going to be a very interesting conversation.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.700]   But I did-- when those like this happens, especially on the day off, first thing I want
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.060]   to do is run in here and ask Andy and Alex and Renee.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.780]   What do you think?
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.780]   What do you think?
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.420]   That's how Twig began is.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.300]   Yeah, it's like, let's go live.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.300]   Let's go live.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   Maybe I will.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.300]   Maybe someday we should.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   All right.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.700]   I'm going to be on the Johnny Dept trial.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.140]   Is it politically incorrect to say call a spade a spade?
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.780]   I'm thinking maybe it's not about shovels.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.420]   If that's the case, I apologize.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.860]   I thought it was about poker.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.500]   It's about suits.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.940]   Heart spades diamonds clubs.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.100]   So if they're playing-- if it's a queen of spades, you're going to name it.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.220]   I thought it was about poker, Ian.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.220]   I hope it is.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.220]   I'm so confused.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.540]   I sincerely hope it is.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:59.380]   By the way, somebody said that you should call Elon Musk a billionaire because it pulls
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.740]   should be the first thing in the word.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.740]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.540]   Well, that was what's his name?
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.540]   Yes, Neil Seibert.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.540]   No.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.540]   Benedict Evans.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.540]   Benedict Evans, the other guy.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.300]   He's so confusing because he's full of BS, but it sometimes works.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.940]   And that's what confuses us.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.860]   Yeah, BS it works.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.140]   We've lost Andy briefly.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.140]   So I'll tell you what.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.540]   Let's take a break and get this-- the flavor of Twitter out of our mouth so we can go back
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.580]   to talking about Apple, which is what really matters around here, the stuff that really
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.580]   matters.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.260]   Actually, I have a question I meant to ask last week, and I'm going to ask you, Renee,
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:41.540]   particularly, but anybody who knows, this eclectic light article, blog post, and I trust
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:47.580]   these guy, this guy, that M1 Thunderbolt ports don't fully support USB 31 Gen 2, and I'm just
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.660]   curious.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.060]   So prepare your thoughts on that.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:28:01.260]   While I prepare a good sleep for you with eight sleep-- oh, I love my eight sleep mattress.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.260]   Eight sleep.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.140]   We actually have a pod pro cover because we liked our mattress.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.060]   You can buy a cover that goes over your existing mattress, or you can buy an eight sleep mattress.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.780]   They are amazing.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:17.500]   So years ago, Lisa and I decided to get an electric blanket because it gets cold at night, and
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.980]   we wanted to be a little warmer.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.940]   And then we moved up to an electric mattress pad, and we thought that was living.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.820]   But there was one thing it doesn't do that our eight sleep does.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.820]   It only heats.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.260]   It doesn't cool.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.820]   The eight sleep is awesome.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.260]   It heats you up.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:41.020]   It cools you off, and it does it according to the rhythms of your sleep.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.940]   So you sleep better.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.300]   Good sleep is the ultimate game changer.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.580]   There's gentle nurse, my friend used to call it.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.860]   Consistent good sleep can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues can decrease the
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.780]   risk of heart disease.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.260]   But most of us, I think, struggle with sleep.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:04.020]   One of the main reasons poor sleep is a problem, temperature.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.700]   If you're waking up in the middle of the night and you're overheated, that's terrible, or
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.940]   freezing cold, that's terrible.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:16.020]   The eight sleep pod pro cover is the most advanced solution on the market for thermoregulation.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.660]   It prepares dynamic cooling and heating, both with biometric tracking.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.700]   Now you see what I'm talking about?
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.620]   You put the cover on your mattress, and the range goes down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.580]   or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.180]   You can set it.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.940]   It will also adjust.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:39.820]   It has a magical doctor that will monitor your tossing and turning and so forth, and
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.820]   adjust it.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.860]   You don't have to use this, but we do.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.460]   It really works.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.980]   By the way, Lisa and I have different sleep habits.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.060]   She likes to start really hot.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.780]   I don't like to start so hot.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.660]   Each side of the bed adjusts separately, which is great.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.420]   It even knows the bedroom temperature, so it's adjusting according to the temperature
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.740]   in the room, which is awesome.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.140]   It will react intelligently to create the optimal sleeping environment.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.660]   Here's the result.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:10.540]   Eight sleep users fall asleep, 32 percent faster, reduce sleep interruptions by 40 percent
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.020]   and get overall more restful sleep.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.820]   I can tell you it absolutely works.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.580]   We got ours about six months ago, and I'm never looking back.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.580]   It's incredible.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.460]   30 percent more deep sleep means you can be confident your mind and body are moving through
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:31.740]   the sleep stages that are vital for physical recovery, hormone regulation, and mental clarity.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.380]   When you're powered by eight sleep, you show up as the best partner, parent, and version
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.500]   of yourself.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.620]   I have to say, I feel a lot better.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.620]   I jump out of bed.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.340]   I have it set.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.020]   I have a whole theory about this that I've read with sleep professionals have explained
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.060]   that we're used to going to bed when it's warmer.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:57.380]   It gets cooler at night, deep sleep, and then it warms up in the morning, and that's when
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   you get out of bed.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.180]   That's the natural rhythm, but of course, we live in climate control environments.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.580]   We don't get that.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.420]   I don't know about you, but for a while, I was waking up in the middle of the night sweating
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.980]   and hot and uncomfortable.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.420]   That was terrible.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:16.220]   Before somebody, not going to name names, steals all the covers, and then you wake up and you're
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.140]   going, "I don't have to worry about it anymore."
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.020]   The eight sleep, I started fairly warm.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.740]   I think it's plus two or three.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.420]   I don't know exactly the temperatures.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.780]   I'd have to investigate.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:32.140]   Then it automatically goes down lower during the night, which means I sleep deeper.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.580]   I sleep cool.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.380]   I can't wait to a hot summer night because this is going to be like air conditioning in
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380]   your bed.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.540]   Then I have it set to wake me up at 8 a.m. by getting warmer, and it does.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.540]   It works.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.540]   It's amazing.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.660]   I wake up instead of freezing and jumping out of bed and running the crack the ice on
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.580]   the water and the sink, I wake up feeling great.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.900]   You will love your eight sleep.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.180]   Go to eight sleep.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.540]   It's spelled out by the way, e-i-g-h-t, sleep.com/macbreak.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.180]   This is the ultimate luxury.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.780]   I understand.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:11.500]   This is for people who are ready to take the next step in absolute luxury, but it's more
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   than luxury.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   It's a good night's sleep.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:19.140]   I would take this over Twitter any day, get the PodPro cover, save $150 at checkout.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.260]   Eight sleep currently ships in the US, Canada, and the UK.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.860]   Eight sleep, e-i-g-h-t, eight sleep.com/macbreak.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.460]   Lisa and I absolutely love it.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.100]   We are never giving up our eight sleep.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.020]   Did we lose Andy?
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.460]   He's lost his internet.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.460]   Holy cow.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.460]   Okay.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:47.940]   Well, magically we've reconfigured the studio for just two of you, and we'll get Andy back
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.620]   as quickly as we can.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.140]   Did Alex eat Andy?
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.620]   I was like, "Don't talk.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.580]   I'm going to be fine."
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.580]   Oh, he's gone.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.580]   Let's talk about regulation.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.580]   Let's talk about...
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:06.620]   Now, I warn you, I have to channel Andy if he's not here, so be careful.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.060]   I just have to warn you, that's my job.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.940]   The EU was hilarious last week, so we do have legitimate grounds for inspecting their
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.940]   action.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.500]   I think there's going to be some action over this.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.940]   I think what, again, this is another example of hot take.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.940]   Hey, good idea.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.660]   Apple removes apps that haven't been updated in a while from the App Store.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.300]   Hot take, great idea.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.500]   And then I start reading about it and thinking about it and go, "Maybe not such a great idea."
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.540]   Sometimes a program, an app is done, right?
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.660]   Or all the sticker apps they remove.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.340]   The stickers aren't even apps.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.340]   They look like pictures.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.820]   They don't never need to be updated.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.980]   So this is...
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:47.860]   Apple says, "Well, this was a policy we established in 2016."
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.820]   And there's so many old Apple apps still on the store.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:57.900]   Yeah, I understand if the store is junked up with apps that don't run or hideously broken,
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.980]   but sometimes something's done.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980]   Yep.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.740]   And it doesn't need to be updated.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.260]   It continues to work with the existing iOS.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.340]   Maybe you don't need to update it.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.260]   What do you think, Renee?
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.100]   I think a lot of the times these policies are well-intentioned and they think, "We don't
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.740]   want a bunch of apps that no longer run."
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   Like you said, they don't run on the store.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.140]   But I think sometimes they stop.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.660]   They don't do enough repercussion modeling.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.620]   And everybody, when you're at a scale that is an Apple or a Google or a Facebook scale,
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.860]   you've got to do repercussion modeling.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   You've got to do outliers.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.580]   You've got to see what the reaction this will be.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   And it could be as simple as saying, "Hey, we're just checking in to make sure you're
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.060]   still actively maintaining this.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.860]   If you don't respond back to us within like three months, then the app's going to be
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.860]   delisted."
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   And they might say, "No, no, no.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   It's fine.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   The app is just done."
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.860]   And they're like, "Okay.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.860]   Flag in the app.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860]   We'll check back in a year.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   Thanks."
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   Like there's a whole bunch of things that you could do to mitigate this.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.620]   I'm glad they're removing apps that no longer work that are basically abandoned where that's
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.260]   good for everybody.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.740]   But it's sad that it's trapping a lot of really functional apps, especially sticker apps,
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.060]   which never needs to be updated.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.900]   So they're removing old sticker apps?
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.740]   Geddian from Icon Factory was complaining about that.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.780]   Oh, I have a whole ton of sticker apps that I love.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.340]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.860]   If you have it downloaded, though, it doesn't remove it from your phone and you just can't
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.860]   download it fresh.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.860]   No, yeah.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.780]   Or if you set up a new device, because every time you set up a new device, it's BitCode
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.380]   does a translation to match the chipset on your device.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.500]   So you get a fresh copy of the app, which wouldn't work.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   Right.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   So it's all these things.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   Right.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   So I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.

[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:25.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   I'm going to go to the next video.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   I said this.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.500]   I'm Apple did not say this, but I think this was the implication.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   You could just add to the, you know, align to the change log saying, you know, April 26,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   2022, I'm not dead yet.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   And then I think they were just shocked at the sudden enforcement because it really hadn't
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   been enforced as well.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   Yes, it's just a theory since 2016.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   This is the policy.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   But it's in the policy.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   It's in the policy.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   It's there.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   It's not like it's hidden.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:16.500]   And so, you know, I think that usually you just got to find with all things in life, we just
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   have to find the way that it wants to work and then just do that thing.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   You know, like it's not like they're doing anything to you.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   Chatroom has just handed me this bulletin.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   Air tags are getting a firmware update.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   Apple today released a new firmware update.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500]   Build 1A301.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.500]   That's actually a big jump from 2-9-1, the last update.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500]   It doesn't say what the update is.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:45.540]   So, Apple has said of late, they are doing more to make the air tag less useful for stalking
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.100]   people.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.700]   So it might have something to do with that.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.900]   It might have a bug.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:57.020]   You can, Apple, I'm sorry, MacRumor says you can get the current firmware version through
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.460]   the Find My app.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.460]   See if you've got it.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.980]   But there is no way, no known way to force the update.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.980]   Just put your air tag near your phone.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.980]   I don't see the air tag.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.180]   I'm kind of curious if the air tags are paying attention to like if it's a family member
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.420]   that has the air tag because it's not like our air tags are going off all the time.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:19.980]   And I have them, my wife has one on her key chain, I have one on the key chain.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.380]   My kids have some and it's kind of funny.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.540]   When all three of them are together, it looks like a little family of air tags moving around
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   on the map.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.540]   Right.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:33.380]   Like for their ones left behind for a little while and these are not going to catch up.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.180]   But I think that they don't ever go off.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.980]   Like I've never heard them do anything and I'm wondering whether they know that they're
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.700]   with a family member of the.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.220]   There's a setting, look and find my, because there's a setting that says whether you should
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.420]   be notified when it's left behind and you can actually drive so infrequently that whenever
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.180]   I get in the car now, it beeps just to remind me that I have it in there.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.580]   Like if you haven't, you haven't, you haven't been in proximity for a few days.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.380]   It's like, I'm still here, buddy.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.420]   It apparently has done some updating because my keys will notify me when I've left them
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:11.780]   behind from my home or the Kaye Panoramica Dale 14 in Wahaka.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.060]   So I'm glad I haven't left my keys there.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.780]   I must, I may have turned that on.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.500]   I don't remember, but that is in the settings.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.820]   I don't know how you find the air.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.980]   Oh, there's a firmware.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   I have one 0291.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.980]   Yes.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.540]   So it hasn't been updated.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.700]   So I guess you just go like this.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.060]   The other thing that that was one of the things Apple said they want to kind of improve
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.620]   on is those notifications that you've left something behind or things like that.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.100]   It's a lot of times it's just talking me.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:44.540]   My AirPods Pro tell me that they've been left behind when they're in my pocket.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.500]   I don't say that there's like unidentified AirPods Pro with you.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   They're mine.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.100]   I'm like, I really got to clean out the electrical contacts on these things.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.940]   Do you think there's a setting or something or you could say, no, no, this is, there might
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.900]   be a way to fix that or no.
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.020]   But then people could stalk me with other people's AirPods.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.020]   Oh, man.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.020]   That's what the sinister.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.020]   You got to have money.
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.020]   Tricky.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.020]   This all is.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   It is really hard.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.060]   It is really, really hard stuff with tons of edge cases.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.220]   It makes nobody happy ever.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.140]   So it's like it's good that they're just in there fighting.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   So you mentioned trouble in the EU for Apple.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.580]   There also is trouble in Japan.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:26.100]   Apple is protesting a report from Japan.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.220]   They want, Japan is seeking fair competition in the OS market.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.700]   Apple launched a protest today following the release of a Japanese government report.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.860]   This is from the Kyoto news that indicated the possibility of regulations being introduced
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.820]   to ensure fair competition in the smartphone operating market.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.820]   Huh?
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:52.460]   Google said it's been actively cooperating with the government.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.340]   I'm not sure exactly.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.860]   I don't know what it means.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.620]   The government will solicit opinions from the public and hold more discussions.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.620]   That's what it means.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.980]   I guess they think that they would like a new operating system.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.980]   That would be difficult.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.980]   That's in Japan.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.860]   What you say is that that would be difficult is no.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   That means no.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.860]   That would be difficult.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.980]   It would be difficult.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.740]   We could maybe get some WebOS phones in.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.740]   We want us to do that.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.740]   Talk to LG.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.740]   They didn't even make phones.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.460]   They bought WebOS, stuck it on TV and got out of the phone business.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.340]   I know it's on my TV and I hate it every time it pops up on my TV.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.340]   Every time I talk about TV.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.340]   It's birds.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.340]   What are those birds doing?
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.340]   Get out of here.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.340]   Get away from me.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.540]   Apple has been, so there's a wave across the country of unionization.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.780]   Starbucks locations now being unionized.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.860]   Amazon warehouses being unionized.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.660]   Apple is feeling some of that pressure too.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:43:01.420]   According to the Verge, they have hired anti-union lawyers to oppose retail workers unionizing.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.580]   The Pinka Tensei here.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:14.180]   Apple is working with anti-union lawyers at Littler Mendelssohn specifically to stop workers
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.460]   in Atlanta at the Atlanta store from having a unionizing vote.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.940]   Do you remember how different the labor laws are in Canada, Leo?
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.860]   It is so starkly different than the US.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.500]   There's no at will employment.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.500]   You want to fire somebody.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.220]   You better be willing to go through it in your long process.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.100]   When you watch all this stuff, here's like, "You want to unionize?
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.580]   Where do you get your complimentary pen?
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.580]   Here you go."
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.300]   It's so different to watch.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:47.660]   Littler is currently representing Starbucks, previously helped McDonald's in 2014.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.060]   Wow.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:54.140]   It feels like companies like Apple that make so much money.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.300]   Maybe you should just say fine.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.300]   Unidize.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:02.460]   I mean, unionization is generally what you do when you don't think there's any upward
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.300]   mobility.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.060]   If you don't think that there's anywhere to go with your job, then you want to join
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.060]   a union to make the best out of where you're at.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:17.180]   Or if the company does things like not pay you for being searched as you leave the store.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:23.740]   There are things that employees quite rightly say, "Yeah, we want to be protected."
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.500]   The best way to protect yourself against a company that hires lawyers by the dozen is
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.900]   collective bargaining.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.060]   That's the way for the company to protect itself from unionizing.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.620]   You're not buying higher-even more lawyers.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.260]   Well, no, to treat everybody, to look at what those issues are and attention to them and
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:44.540]   to address them, you don't need a union if the company's—I think that Apple does have
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   the money and they should do what's necessary to have the employees.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:57.620]   It does create a much more complicated situation for everybody to have a union in the mix.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.580]   But I think that it happens because you're not doing what you need to do.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.580]   You're not explaining yourself.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.580]   John, if you guys—
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.180]   And you don't have to answer this.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.660]   The NLRB says, "I can't ask you this question, John.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.780]   Have you guys started a unionized back in the kitchen back there?"
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.780]   I can't let you know.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.780]   Okay, fine.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.900]   We're going to get Littler in here.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.900]   Exactly.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.860]   I'm a proud member of AfterSag.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.180]   My radio show is a union show.
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.660]   And I'm happy to be a member of the union.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.980]   I pay him a couple hundred bucks a year.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:35.700]   But there's things, for instance, like union benefits that Apple, I'm sure, has very good
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.260]   benefits, so that's not an issue.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:42.980]   But there are—if you're a contractor and you're—after—and SAG is a good thing because
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.460]   you generally don't have the same job day and day out.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.220]   So having health care from the union is a good thing.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.700]   Having insurance and pension from the union is a good thing.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.060]   I'm not against unions at all.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.060]   I think unions are a good idea.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.700]   Unless you guys start to unionize, which case?
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.700]   No more free ones on Wednesday.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   I think—
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.700]   I think—
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.700]   That's called Amazon People.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.660]   I think unions are really necessary in a lot of places.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.660]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:11.780]   So I think that the easiest way for a company that doesn't have a union to keep a union,
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.860]   you need people—
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.140]   Spend that money instead of on lawyers and pincartins.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.500]   Spend that money on people.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.980]   Right.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:26.260]   So why—I don't know, honestly, what the grievances are at this Atlanta store, but
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:33.900]   why—if they want something, why wouldn't Apple—probably pay, right?
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.900]   From the start—
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.180]   Here's a quote from the Verge.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.140]   "From the start," this is one current retail employee who says, "I'm not going to give
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.660]   you my name."
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.780]   From the start, I thought unionization was a good thing.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.340]   Pay is so unequal at the stores.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.620]   There are people who have been roles for less time making more money than people who
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.140]   have worked in the same roles for years.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.740]   They position themselves as a company that's open to feedback, but nobody acts on it.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.820]   Okay.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:04.620]   Last week, Apple retail workers at the Cumberland Mall in Atlanta filed for a union election
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.700]   with the communication workers of America, CWA.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:14.100]   And of course, the fear Amazon Starbucks and now Apple have is if one store unionizes,
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.300]   they're all going to unionize.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.900]   Well, yeah, of course.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   Maybe.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   No.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   Maybe.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.580]   You sure, John, you know, is there anything I can do to make you—
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.580]   [laughter]
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.580]   Make you happier.
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.580]   Where's that ultra?
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.220]   [laughter]
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.260]   You want a studio ultra, huh?
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:38.460]   Suddenly, suddenly John had some new headphones and studio ultra and Apple studio.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.380]   And he found that it was very easy to fit into his Tesla.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.260]   It was provided by the company.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:49.340]   I think it's—I guess it's true that if you did—if you really made sure that pay
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:55.780]   was equitable, that people were treated well, that you had good benefits, you didn't do
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.420]   one of the things that tech companies do a lot, which is, I think, part of the problem
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:04.300]   is use contract employees instead of full-time employees to avoid paying benefits.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.820]   Maybe if you're making a lot of money and you did all those things you took care of
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.260]   your employees, yeah, maybe that would be the right thing to do.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.260]   I agree.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.460]   There's a lot of contract work done in Silicon Valley, which is really disheartening, especially
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   when you see the quality of—
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.460]   Uh-oh.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.460]   Here comes Burke.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.460]   And it's off—
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.500]   It costs you Burke—it costs me Burke to have you move that in there.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:26.140]   Oh, Andy, it not goes back.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:32.180]   Union worker, Burke McQuinn, has just pushed Andy back into the studio.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.940]   I see—I see Burke going two different—
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.940]   I see Burke going two different—
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.940]   I see Burke going two different—
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.940]   Two different—
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   Two different—
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   Two different—
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.300]   Yeah, we need—yeah, wait a minute, Burke, you can't touch the camera.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.100]   You're the monitor mover.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:48.420]   I do remember that when I used to do Live with Regis and Kelly, ABC studio there,
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:55.340]   was a union shop, and I couldn't open the boxes of the equipment that I had sent to
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.780]   me to demonstrate on the show.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.380]   The union guy had to do that.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.340]   There was a lot of feather bedding, I think, and stuff like that.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:09.260]   And of course, there was a very active foreman, and that part of that is to protect the employees.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.020]   And I have to say, as someone who started with non-union crews and then ended up doing
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.660]   lots and lots of union jobs, is that it made me be a grown-up.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:22.620]   Like, I was running—we'd run crews really long hours with no breaks, and we'd do all
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.420]   kinds of crazy stuff, and then we couldn't do that anymore.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.420]   We got to take a break every three and a half hours, and there's three to five hours,
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.700]   and there's a lunch break, and it has to be this long, and it has to do these things.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:36.180]   And if you go long, and what happened was, is that I got way better at managing the logistics
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:40.820]   of my programs because of the rules that I now were sitting inside of that I didn't
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.820]   have a choice of, which is part of the deal.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.140]   I didn't have a weight—I couldn't tell a client, "Oh, we can't do this."
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.980]   I'm in Oscone. I can't—I have to play by the rules, and these are the rules, and
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.020]   we're going to play with them as best we possibly can.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.980]   And clients just shrugged it off because that's what they had to do.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:59.340]   But I applied most of those things to everything after that.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.340]   You think about it.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.340]   Everybody made it to bed.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.340]   Welcome back, Andrew.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.420]   Yes, sorry about that.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:11.500]   There's some—I had a conversation with the electricians who were doing, like, on the
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   building before the show, and they said, "No, no problem.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.580]   There'll be no suspension of your electricity."
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:22.340]   But then they were doing work in the basement, and they unplugged my connection to the Fios
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.340]   network.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.340]   Wait a minute.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.340]   Your internet uses electricity?
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.340]   Indeed it does.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:29.060]   We didn't know that.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.820]   I have empirical evidence now that indeed it does.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.060]   Right now I'm talking about you.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.060]   You just quit, Andy.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   We thought we said something so offensive that you just unplug it.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.060]   But then walk out on us.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.060]   No, we can't.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.980]   See, that's a nice thing about living in a quaint, like touristy village because right
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:50.900]   now I'm connecting to you through the neighborhood, like $20 a week or $5 a day, Wi-Fi while we
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:54.100]   figure out what they need to plug back in.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.100]   But I'm back.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.100]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.460]   To get back in, to get back in, to jump back into the conversation.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.740]   Yeah, there are bosses who think that, "You know what?
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.140]   I had people working like four or five hours late today, but you know what?
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.820]   I'm such a good boss.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.300]   I paid for pizza."
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.300]   Yes, exactly.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.300]   Exactly.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.660]   Because we're a union, you're not paying for pizza.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.100]   You're paying for double overtime.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.100]   And guess what?
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:23.340]   You know that thing where you stop paying me at five, but you don't let me leave the
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.900]   store until five, 35 until the security person searches all my belongings?
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.740]   That stuff is no longer something you're going to be getting away with.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:40.180]   The thing is, there comes a time when even if the relationship between management and
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:47.580]   employees is good, it's good that employees have the ability to just simply be put into
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:52.020]   place an opposing force equal and opposite to the force of management.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:57.220]   That doesn't have to be, "Hey, we guys got together and we had a conversation and we
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.340]   thought we'd bring it to you, the manager, to discuss that maybe you could talk to your
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.900]   boss to maybe figure out if somehow we don't have to stick around for their half hour,
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:11.540]   we're asked, "Okay, well, we follow the grievance with the union.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.580]   We don't want this to affect our relationship at all.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.820]   You'll just have to talk to our union about it."
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:23.020]   So this is why if companies think that, "Hey, we're all a family here."
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.340]   Yeah, families sometimes sue each other because they have to.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:31.900]   If you want your eyes opened, and I have been following the subreddit for some time,
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:41.100]   which are anti-work or r/antiwork, a great Reddit site, you'll read stuff that bosses
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:45.260]   are doing to their employees and you'll just shake your head and go, "There are some bad
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.900]   bosses out there that really are."
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:53.380]   Delta Airlines, I was reading something the other day that they sign in their benevolence.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:53:00.460]   You know the people who work for Delta, who get you, who get you, and the plane airlines.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.260]   They don't get paid until the door is closed.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:10.460]   So they're basically working for Delta for free every time, as you're boarding, as you're
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.700]   getting people seated, as you're hearing people saying, "Hey, my kid needs an extra
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.140]   pillow or I need to..."
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.140]   That's all free.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.140]   That's all free.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.820]   Delta has just changed that.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:21.820]   Stunning.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.740]   That was incredible to me that they got away with that for so long.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.020]   All the airlines do it, and the hope is, if you follow Heather Poole on Twitter, she
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:35.580]   is the world famous flight attendant.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.780]   She says, "The hope is all airlines will now start to recognize that, yeah, they're
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.220]   actually working, welcoming you on board.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.220]   They're working."
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.380]   Yeah, that's a perfect example, Andy, actually.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.700]   And that's a unionized position, by the way.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.660]   Sometimes it's not enough just to have a union.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.700]   Oh, we're seeing massive unionization amongst, like even just what I used to do, like bloggers
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:00.820]   tech media in general, they're joining a lot of the writers unions, and you look at it
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:06.180]   and say they've frozen salaries on blog posts, like 20 bucks a blog post, which is not sustainable
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.460]   for three years, but the CEO gets a 30 billion-dollar vote.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.460]   Exactly.
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:20.860]   So I do think this is part actually of a nationwide trend of especially hourly employees standing
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.540]   up and saying, "We're not going to take this anymore."
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.860]   So the tech industry needs to pay attention.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:31.460]   The story we were doing, Andy, is that Apple has unfortunately hired a union-busting firm
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:32.940]   in Atlanta.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.500]   They're also the company you hire.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:41.140]   I'm sorry, I won't get into it, but I was looking into this company and yeah, they're
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:47.820]   not the company you hire because you're being sued unfairly by your employees who are making
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.380]   unreasonable requests.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.300]   They're the people you hire when it turns out that you're an incredibly sexist organization
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:55:00.500]   that has not been promoting any women or people of color for the past eight years, and suddenly
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:06.500]   they're suing you for lost wages, for lost compensation, etc.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.900]   They're not great people.
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.140]   They're wartime consigliaries, so to speak.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.180]   You hire them for a specific person.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.620]   On the plus side, Apple is not hiring Pinkerton men.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.620]   Yes.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:17.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.620]   They have not...
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:19.620]   Let's give them credit.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:25.660]   They haven't had armed people in bowler hats and mustaches lined up in front of Pinkalcantron
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.660]   workers.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.740]   ScooterX is reminding me that I said I was going to ask Renee about this from the eclectic
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.460]   light company.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.460]   This guy's an artist.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:40.380]   He's very talented, but he also writes really good pieces on Max, and I read it regularly,
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.100]   and I was a little perturbed by this article from last week.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:49.100]   I meant to ask about it, and I forgot to last week, so let me not forget it this week.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:54.860]   Apple claims he writes that all its new models using M1 chips come with Thunderbolt ports,
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:00.460]   which support USB 3.1 Gen2 up to 10 gigabits.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:05.700]   However, many users are reported they're not getting that speed.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:14.380]   And apparently, I don't know if this is confusion over what these terms mean, or if Apple is
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.380]   underperforming.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:21.540]   Currently, he says Apple makes no claim that any ports on its M1 model support 3.2, only
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.900]   the more widespread 3.1 Gen2.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:30.540]   He says the problem is the speeds, and it's easy enough to check and see.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:36.460]   In normal testing, five gigs should yield about 500 megabytes per second.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:40.300]   He did a bunch of testing and got nothing close to that.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:44.660]   Renee, I'm sure this has been on your radar since last week, and I apologize for not asking
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:45.660]   about it.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.220]   What are your thoughts?
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.700]   I have looked into it.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.460]   I'm on a bit of a backlog, Leo, because there's been so much of having to explain how basics
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.700]   of computing works.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.020]   And I don't mind that at all, because this stuff is super complicated.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.020]   Oh, it is.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.780]   We talked about with benchmarks.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.180]   You can't just benchmark anything, because are you hitting a performance core?
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.980]   Are you hitting an efficiency core?
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.940]   Are you hitting an accelerator engine?
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:09.940]   And then there was a whole storage thing, they're not letting you store stuff.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.180]   Then there was the GPUs are being under-delivered, and they're not.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:17.300]   It's just you don't understand how GPUs work.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:22.340]   This stuff is complicated in several ways, because one, they keep changing what USB means.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.500]   So USB 3.1 becomes Gen 2.0.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.660]   The labels are outrageous, but the other thing is a lot of the stuff is really complicated.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.300]   It's almost like, not the same extent, but 5G.
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.980]   It'll give you a speed for 5G, but it really means if you're sitting on the tower by yourself
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:43.060]   and there's nobody else on it, and the weather is exactly as they measured it, so much of
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.180]   this is dependent on the heat, not just a heated device, but the heat of the environment
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.180]   around you.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.500]   And anything else is happening.
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.860]   Is it transferring power as well as data?
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.020]   And is it a bunch of large files?
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.620]   It is a bunch of small files.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.580]   What other overhead is being done on the computer when it's transferring these stuff,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.380]   because it's not raw transfer speed, it has to manage all of that on the computer.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:07.500]   And it becomes like, yes, theoretically you can get this, but because of XYZ number of
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.660]   factors, this is like a realistic expectation for these things.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:15.540]   And I think it would behoove somebody, I hope it's not me, but it would behoove somebody
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:20.820]   to get a really good set of explainers out there to say, and this happens, like someone
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:25.380]   will write this, the thing that said that Apple was bad at GPUs, Hacker News just went
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.740]   through bit by bit and said, no, this is how a GPU actually works, and they'll go through
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:34.420]   and say, no, this is how USB protocols actually work, because they're a bunch of really smart
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.420]   people.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:41.180]   But at first blush, it's hard to take very simplified marketing material and then apply
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.540]   it to your real world conditions.
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:49.180]   So I always look at it as an ideal, and then if it doesn't deviate too far from that, it's
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:50.420]   probably fine.
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.780]   So do you think Howard screwed up the benchmarks?
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.740]   No, I think what he gets on those things is what he gets.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.380]   I think it's usually expectations and just general awareness.
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.340]   I'm sure I haven't had the opportunity to do this yet, but I'm sure when I talk to a
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.740]   USB Thunderbolt engineer about this, they'll say, yes, but when you look at this test,
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:12.260]   he's also putting this through it, and then this is going to depend on what the file
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.260]   system is doing at XYZ point, and there'll be a very long and elaborate explanation that
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.580]   no human being ever has to sit through.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.260]   And I'm not saying he does say that he tried the same drives on a variety of machines,
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:30.300]   and the only one that seems to support the full speed USB 31 Gen 2 is an M1 Mac Studio
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.140]   Macs that the others do not, which is--
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:37.900]   Well, some people say the Ultra because-- The Ultra has Thunderbolt on the front.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.700]   The Macs is the only one that doesn't have Thunderbolt on the front, right?
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:42.700]   That's true.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.820]   Yeah, but like some people are saying that those are much faster, and it might just be
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:48.060]   because they have that I/O controller to themselves, because you've literally got double the
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:51.420]   I/O controllers, and if you have something else plugged in, you're not sharing any of
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.860]   that bandwidth or any of that.
[00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:01.380]   Is there any external storage that's going over like 2.8 gigs?
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:06.580]   The reason I asked is that my studio, the biggest mistake I made with buying the studio,
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:11.060]   I love my studio, by the way, but the biggest mistake I made with I didn't put-- I would
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.980]   have spent the extra money on eight terabytes in turn, hard drive space, because it is so
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.980]   fast.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:23.220]   It is five gigs a second, megabytes, five gigabytes a second, and it made a huge difference.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.580]   I had stuff that I couldn't run.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:29.980]   I literally couldn't play it back on my M1 Mac Mini, like just couldn't play it back, and
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.980]   I just moved all the stuff onto my studio and boom, like butter.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.860]   This is eight tracks of 5.7K Blackmagic RAW.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.860]   It's like a lot of--
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.460]   People have to get the U.K.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.100]   You can be storage gated, but even for rendering, you can be storage gated rather than processor
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.100]   gated.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.460]   Yeah, so exactly.
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:53.780]   The thing is, it wasn't the processor speed, it was the drive speed, and I couldn't-- now
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.740]   I'm having trouble, my spinning drives will not work with my studio, and I don't know
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   why.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.980]   They just don't work.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:04.260]   So then I was using MBMEs and so on and so forth, and then I just moved it over, and
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:12.700]   then it worked fine, but it was a tricky problem for what I'm working on.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.580]   I realized I wish I had gotten eight terabytes, because I just would have moved whole projects,
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.620]   because for some reason, most of my projects end up being about six to eight terabytes.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.020]   That's just what they would have been.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.260]   That's the big-- if you're buying-- if you're thinking about a studio, think really hard
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.980]   that there is nothing that I can find in the external world that is as fast as the drive,
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.260]   and that's the first time I've ever had a computer that had a faster internal drive
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.460]   than anything I could buy externally.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:44.020]   And I'm kind of on a search, but the best I can do is about 2.8 with the OWC little MBME
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.020]   rates.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:53.460]   So Mr. Oakley's recommendation is if you have a USB 3.1 Gen 2 device connected to a Thunderbolt
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.780]   3.0, it's Thunderbolt 4 ports that are having problems, so connected with Thunderbolt 3.0
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:02.540]   dock, or if you have a studio display, they should work better on the studio display
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.540]   USB ports.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.060]   And I have those drives around here.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.540]   I'll try to do that myself.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.300]   Yeah, my problem is I can't remember which are which.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.540]   I specifically bought those drives recently for that 10 gigabyte gigabit.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.020]   Yeah, for overhead.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020]   So yeah.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.060]   You know what I'd be curious about, Alex, is if you can find an external drive that
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.900]   gives you any on a Thunderbolt, I would have to be Thunderbolt 3, right, or Thunderbolt
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.020]   4, that would give you anywhere near the performance adequate performance.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.540]   I guess nothing would have given you the speed of the internal drive.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.820]   No, that's the whole thing.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.820]   It just doesn't.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.180]   So I bought, I always buy small internals because I'm like, oh, I really want to spend
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.180]   all that.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.180]   Right.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.180]   That was mistake.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:49.380]   So the only takeaway from this is probably don't buy, if you have an M1, do not buy a
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:55.420]   USB 3.1 Gen 2 drives or at least don't expect them to give you the 10 gigabits per second.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   Super speed.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.780]   And it's possible there is an error somewhere and that Apple fix it.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.620]   It's just generally like when these kind of articles come out, usually Apple has tested
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.620]   this stuff.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.540]   Like they screwed up the studio display so they can screw up anything.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.260]   I'm not going to like figure out where, but a lot of times it's just, you know, you got
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.340]   to figure out how it works.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.980]   Speaking of which, look who's here on his updated studio display.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.980]   Ladies.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980]   Whoa.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.980]   That is so much better.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.380]   I'm going to turn on to her.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.380]   You have a face.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.020]   I don't know why it keeps changing.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.780]   I was without a face.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.500]   So let me, I'm going to turn off center stage just so you can see what it normally looks
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500]   like.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.740]   So this is what center stage turned off.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:33.740]   But I have to.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.740]   Turn on center stage.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.300]   At least the quality looks like it's better.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.860]   It's not as mushy as it was.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.860]   Do you feel like that?
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.860]   You're not flat.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.860]   There's still so much headroom.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.860]   There is still a lot of headroom.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.180]   I also didn't know that it did portrait.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.180]   So there's that.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.740]   If you if you're doing a nice portrait, pretty good.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   Yeah, not a bad portrait.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.500]   But this is a little bit clearer.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:58.540]   I don't look so potato-y as I as I use this with less potato.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.060]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.820]   But it's also worth noting that I've got two very bright lights here.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.980]   So I'm going to turn those off and just pretend like I've only got my offices overhead lights
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.980]   on.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.660]   So here go without my, oh, I guess not.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.620]   They don't want to turn off without my fancy.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.620]   It's all IOT, isn't it?
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.620]   Exactly.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.620]   You need to switch, man.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.620]   Rosemary is controlling his life.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.620]   I have to say it looks better.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.740]   Now, do you, you don't use that when you do iOS today, right?
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.140]   No, I do not.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.660]   Oh, there you go.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:29.660]   But there you go.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:34.940]   Without the lights, which still it's not as sort of grainy and potato as it was before.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940]   There's the kind of comparison.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.420]   They've done a good job of smoothing without.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.660]   Give us a profile.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.100]   I think that looks a lot better.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.100]   Honestly.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.100]   I wish I could do one before.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.420]   You have such flawless skin.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.420]   I can't tell.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.580]   We're not being sarcastic.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.420]   I thought it was a big deal that I shaved before the show.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.420]   You need to profile.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.420]   No, right?
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:00.420]   You're so nice.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   He's gorgeous.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.420]   I know.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.420]   So frustrating.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.420]   Well, that's very kind.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.740]   It's all because of the update from there.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.500]   It's not sarcasm.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:13.420]   Just like just like just like just like Renee and Alex like inspire me to like get better
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.060]   lighting and better cameras.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.780]   You're like maybe I should get a better profile.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.900]   Get the straight get the straight razor.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.900]   Just tidy up.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.900]   He's a little.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.900]   He's a little.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   He's a little.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.060]   There's nothing we can do.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:28.980]   Like I love you dearly, but you were I like we're pretty much maxed out at this point.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   Micah's got so much.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   Okay.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.980]   Pretty headroom.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.780]   Before I turn to the Rad, I'm going to go away.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.980]   Micah, hey, thank you very much.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:41.180]   Micah Sergeant, the host of iOS today and Tech News Weekly and producer of this show.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:45.900]   And thank you for risking your brand new Mac studio by putting beta.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.300]   Were you already in the developer beta?
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.300]   It was not on the beta.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   I had to do the whole thing.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.300]   Holy cow.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.300]   You're welcome.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   Holy cow.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.300]   I really appreciate it.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.300]   But that's right.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.340]   But honestly, that's why we're glad you have the studio display and exactly.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.340]   So I was able to test it.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   And I do think that they did.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.220]   I can see that there was an improvement because I said to you, I called some folks who are
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:10.700]   not even techy with the camera, the original camera and they were like, Hey, you know that
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.380]   thing you always tell us where you tell us to wipe off the front facing camera.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.580]   I think you need to do that.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.300]   No, that's just the camera in this thing.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.380]   Thank you, Micah.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.380]   No problem.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.380]   Talk to you later.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.380]   Great.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   Micah Sergeant, everybody.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380]   Legend.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.540]   That's really great that he was able to do that.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.460]   We were able to get that done in such a problem.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.460]   It's actually fixed.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.460]   It looks fixed.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.460]   It does.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   Big deal.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.460]   Big story.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.460]   Let's take a little break.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.460]   Come back.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.300]   We have lots more to talk about.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.860]   You're watching Mac break weekly, Renee Richie, Andy and Aco, Alex Lindsey.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:43.980]   I did that very fast, John.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.980]   Please don't unionize.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.980]   Oh, I don't care.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.100]   No, no, raise the red flag of revolution.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:55.180]   You have nothing to lose, but your any day now.
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.180]   Right.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.700]   Maydays is workers of the world.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.700]   You're keeping bindings.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.700]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.980]   I'm going to be in New York City for May Day.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.020]   I'm anticipating that the annual big May Day parade on Columbus Avenue is going to be slightly
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.020]   subdued this year.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.020]   I'm just guessing.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.020]   We just need a little.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.220]   We just need to get a get Billy Bragg up there and we're good to go.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:21.180]   We had our big yearly parade on Saturday and it was like it was amazing.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.380]   It was like the last two years never happened.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   No masks.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.700]   Everybody's like, I'm wearing a mask.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:33.180]   Everybody was out there partying, snogging, drinking beer.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:37.260]   The day after we had the antique fair was even more crowded.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:44.020]   At least here in Little Petaluma, it feels like the last two years are just a bad dream.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.620]   Much like Dallas.
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.660]   Oh, Patrick.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:55.420]   One of the things people wondered was why people who lived through the 1918 pandemic never talked
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.580]   about it.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:01.140]   And now I know why because I can't even remember what happened.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.220]   It's PTSD.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:07.220]   It's like, yeah, it turns out you were terrified for two years and you just forget about it.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.220]   Let's not think about it.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.420]   It's like we're, it's weird.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.260]   It's like we're panwinkle waking up.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:20.020]   Anyway, let's talk about our sponsor of the hour wealth front.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.140]   I'm really excited to be able to share this with you.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.620]   They have a great app on iOS.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.420]   It really looks good, but it's more than just an app.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:34.180]   It's really about building your wealth for your future, whether it's to put the kids
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:39.020]   to college, to retire comfortably, to buy a new home.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:45.460]   The secret to building wealth is not diamond hands.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.220]   It's not cryptocurrency.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:53.460]   Look, all of that could be fun, a thrill ride, kind of like casino gambling or eating questionable
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.780]   street food.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.180]   But honestly, day trading stocks is not the secret to investing success.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:07.620]   One has a ton of data to show that time in the market almost always beats timing the market.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.740]   In fact, that was a famous long bet Warren Buffett had with the hedge fund manager.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:18.060]   The hedge fund manager said, I can out manage your, your, your long holds, your index funds.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.300]   Warren said, let's have a bet.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.260]   Warren one.
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.660]   Warren one.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:28.020]   Wealth front, they're globally diversified portfolios automatically optimize the goals
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.820]   you set, the risk levels you choose.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:37.540]   They do things like tax loss harvesting, which gets you tax breaks to boost your returns.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:41.740]   So when the market goes down a little bit, that's actually good news sometimes.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.140]   It's called tax loss harvesting.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.700]   They actually invented it.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.780]   They invented the software that does it.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.460]   You can personalize your portfolio.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.460]   Now this is nice.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:54.100]   Wealth front is added categories that you can choose and say, you know, I mean, there's
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.580]   a stock, if you don't want to get involved and you say, answer the questions.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:58.580]   Here's my risk tolerance.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.460]   Here's my timeframe and let wealth front invest for you.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.460]   That's fine.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.580]   But if you want to say, no, I want socially responsible funds or clean energy or no, I
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.500]   want to get into cannabis or cryptocurrency.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.740]   Yes, cryptocurrency, they have it all.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.900]   So you can, you can tailor your portfolio as well.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.620]   When we started talking about wealth front years ago, they were just getting started.
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:23.420]   Now they have $27 billion in assets, half a million people use wealth front to build
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.940]   their wealth.
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:25.940]   That's a PDF.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:31.180]   Just name them the best Robo advisor for 2022 and we're just in first four months.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.180]   That's pretty good.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.180]   Right?
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.180]   I do want to tell you this.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:40.140]   Go to wealthfront.com/macbreak to start building your wealth and get your first $5,000
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.900]   managed for free for life.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:47.100]   W E A L T H F R O N T dot com slash Mac break.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.100]   Read about it.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.140]   Do yourself a favor, especially if you're an iOS download the app.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:53.580]   It is, is really nice.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:58.260]   It's so nice to fire up the app and look at your net worth and watch it go up.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.860]   It feels good.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:05.420]   Go to wealthfront.com/macbreak and get started today.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:10.180]   Wealthfront really, really smart.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:15.220]   Thank you, Wealthfront for supporting Mac break weekly.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.500]   Apple has announced a service program.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.380]   If you have an Apple Watch Series six with the blank screen issues, that means, yeah,
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.940]   there's something wrong.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.180]   So send it to us.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.900]   We'll fix it.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.780]   You can get a free repair through an Apple authorized service provider or Apple itself.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:37.380]   They say only a small percentage of 40 millimeter Apple Watch Series six models are affected.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:42.460]   They were managed, manufactured between April and September of last year.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:48.060]   You could check if it's eligible for repair by entering the serial number on this special
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.020]   Apple website.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:55.220]   If you just search for Apple Watch service program, you can enter the serial number right
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.220]   here.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.620]   Is that if you don't find a Pixel watch in the bar, Leo?
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:05.060]   You're referring to something that actually happened.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.060]   I understand.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.060]   Yes.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.060]   Deja vu.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.580]   That's the Pixel watch that's going to be released in three weeks.
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:17.100]   Apparently, somebody had an engineering sample and left behind in a press bar.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.500]   I know that it's going to be announced at Google I/O.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.420]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.900]   It seems very much, yeah.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.780]   I don't know for a fact, but it seems very much like if there are a bunch of other signs
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:31.140]   before this that pointed that out so much so that I haven't even talked about it.
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.740]   I didn't even talk about last week on my Google material.
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.740]   So it's fine.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.740]   So what's fine.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:41.380]   And after the thing is what makes it weird is that nobody came to claim it after a few
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.380]   weeks.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.780]   And so like the bartender had a friend who he knew was like kind of a nerd.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.180]   So he gave it to him.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.180]   And he--
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.180]   Nobody came to it.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.180]   That's hysterical.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.180]   And yeah, I know.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:55.860]   And Android Central, unlike Gizmodo, they have a lick of sense.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.860]   So this person just basically said, hey, I really love Android Central.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:04.540]   Here's some pictures of what I think is the Pixel watch that someone left behind in a
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.980]   restaurant so they didn't pay for it, they didn't solicit it, their hands are absolutely
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.980]   clean.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:12.300]   But it now looks like, yeah, that's odd.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:19.660]   Which it shows-- if anything has demonstrated to me that release the thing of it is that
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:24.860]   back then, at this point, engineering samples are in the hands of such dunderheads as to
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:31.100]   A, leave it behind in a restaurant and B, not to be so panicked about it that they retrace
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:35.780]   all of their steps and they didn't immediately get it back within two or three days.
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.740]   That means that the web of people that are being led in on this is about as wide as it
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.740]   gets before release.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.260]   It was Larry's you're saying, right?
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.260]   You're not going to admit it.
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.260]   They're telling us it was Larry's.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.100]   Larry had it again with the Larry.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.180]   Also shout out to Shootie from Android Central because she's one hell of a reporter.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:50.180]   She did a really good job.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.380]   Yeah, she did a great job.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:58.620]   It was so much of a-- I know this isn't a Google pocket, but comparing it to-- I think
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:04.220]   that we can always refer back to what Gizmodo did as absolutely the worst way to do it.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:09.620]   Not only that, but the Gizmodo report about the iPhone 4 was it or the iPhone 4 I think.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.620]   Not for for you.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.100]   Yeah, it also didn't.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.100]   They had it.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.580]   Okay, if they're going to pay money for a device that belongs to Apple and that they
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:22.460]   know doesn't belong to the person they bought it from, if they know they're buying Dolomans
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:28.620]   goods, they as well get an engineer who knows phones to look at this and say, gee, isn't
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.620]   it weird?
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:33.300]   I think that they're putting the antenna on the outside of the case, which is something
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.700]   that they've never done before.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.940]   All they did was, hey, look, we've got pictures of the new phone.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.180]   Hey, aren't we great?
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:42.700]   We're at the Android Central thing, got as deep into it as they possibly could given
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.340]   the limited information that they had.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.100]   So I entered my serial number and I'm not eligible.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   Oh, man.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.820]   It's a good thing, Leo.
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.380]   Yeah, no, I haven't had any problems.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.020]   What is the symptom?
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.980]   Is your screen goes blank?
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:57.980]   Well, yeah.
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.500]   So it's a manufacturing issue.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   Yeah, I didn't have that.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:04.220]   And it means it's significant enough that they're going to do this because this is like all
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:07.940]   big companies, they have a series of reporting systems that escalate these issues when they
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.940]   reach a critical mass.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.380]   They have like recalls versus like bringing in full fix it for you programs.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:18.660]   I guess we should, by the way, Andy, talk about the PixelWatch a little bit because you
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:24.020]   can use it on an iPhone, unlike the Apple Watch, which you can't use on an Android phone.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.740]   Yeah, it's it looks it looks really good.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.780]   It doesn't look like a piece of trash.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780]   What I like about it.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.140]   Well, all we know is this one picture from the bar.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.860]   Well, but it does look hot, though.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.180]   It does match all the renders we've been seeing for the past year.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:44.700]   I like the fact that it looks like it looks like just around like a pocket watch.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.580]   There's no band on it.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:52.260]   There's like a metal, the person who had it actually also did a Reddit AMA and says it
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.500]   feels like a quality object.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.060]   It doesn't seem like a plastic like fitness watch.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.820]   But also I like the fact that they're doing this.
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:03.060]   They stole the same trick that Apple uses where the screen does not does not go all the
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:07.740]   way to the edge of the device, but it's inside a black bezel that makes it look like the
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:12.540]   screen is actually the entire bulge of that surface is going to be the screen.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.320]   And with no banding that really shows you with no banding that really shows on the wrist,
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.320]   that could be really cool.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:25.060]   It has the has a scroll the scroll stem seems to have two two buttons above it below it.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:29.860]   And it seems to have interchangeable bands, although not the stand the the complaints of
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:35.140]   people are making in response to this is that Oh geez, I wish that used like other fitness
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.940]   other fitness companies, they have like standard watch bands that have the thing.
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.580]   Those are so hard to put on.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:41.580]   Same company.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:48.060]   But that's exactly why you're also hearing you're also hearing people saying, Oh, I bet
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.940]   this was planted as a PR stud.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:56.460]   But no, I'm I'm pretty sure not because everybody everybody who has ever like had advanced hardware
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.900]   from anybody knows that they would not just simply drop it off and then let anybody pick
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:06.940]   it up and then just let without any information about it spread whatever speculation that
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.100]   people want to have about it.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:12.860]   If they were to do this, it would like leak it to somebody that they trust and they flizzo
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.860]   is very simple with whatever this product is going to be.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.780]   They would give them a deep, deep, deep training cycle on background and then like to make
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.420]   sure that whatever they say about it's after two weeks of being coached about exactly what
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.100]   all these features are, why that then you know.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:35.340]   Here's the here's what it looks like compared to an Apple watch and and my kids is and the
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.340]   class Samsung Galaxy watch.
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.700]   Yeah, it looks great.
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:40.700]   It looks.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.700]   I think it's pretty.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.740]   I like it kind of looks like it's kind of bulging up a little bit.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.500]   It's like I forget like POCO where somebody announced their debuting their watch.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.940]   It looks like the first gen Apple watch.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940]   Why even bother?
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.940]   This looks different.
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.940]   It's great.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.780]   It's not final hardware because I was I immediately like zoomed in the photo to see like what all
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.740]   the writing on the back of it for like, Oh, was it saying about the sensor?
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.740]   Was it saying about this and felt the text which which would be I'm sure in the final
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:11.060]   is going to be, you know, heart rate sensor depth IP 68, whatever.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.500]   It's actually Laura Mipsum text.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.500]   It's Greek text.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.500]   Right.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.500]   Right.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.700]   So this is yeah, this is a prototype.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:17.700]   I would.
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:18.700]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.700]   Okay.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.700]   I still think the Apple watch kind of sleighs all but no, you know, you know, you're right.
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.500]   And some are again, again, again, again, again, back to Apple.
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.420]   Like, I'm going to buy this because I feel like I have to as part of like my library.
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:36.940]   Also I have because I bought like a $1,100 phone from the Google store and I get because
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.980]   I'm a member of Google one, I get 10% back in store credit.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:44.140]   So basically I'm going to be able to get it for like much $110 off.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.500]   So that's another reason to get it.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:51.620]   But honestly, if this doesn't really do it for me, I'm going to give up on on Android
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:52.860]   where or where I was.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:58.540]   I'm just going to say, I don't care how hard it is to just sync it to my iPhone 10 that
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.740]   spends most of its time like in a in a storage closet.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:05.820]   I'm going to just buy an Apple watch and that's going to be my fitness watch because like
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.500]   you said, there's just nothing that even approaches it.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.500]   I'm tired.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:13.820]   I'm tired of I'm tired of having to drive a trabant in the Eastern Germany while all
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:14.820]   across the border.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.380]   I see people is what it feels like.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:19.820]   I'm just saying he spends his and BBP of W's, you know, you can pull a Linus.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.260]   I just don't you got to read any other watches.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.540]   You know, it's you know, I don't see many other watches out in the wild.
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.100]   There's a lot of amazing watches out there.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.380]   You see some Fitbits.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.380]   There's a lot of Fitbits.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:35.020]   I'm Rolex is yeah, a few of those.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.580]   You must hang out with oligarchs.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.580]   Okay.
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.580]   Cassie guys.
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.580]   Oligarchs.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:40.580]   I love that.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:48.500]   You know, what's surprising is Google's never made a watch.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.060]   You know, we think about Google where and where OS and where watches, but it was always
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:58.020]   Motorola or fossil or somebody Google's never made a watch.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:01.940]   And I'm curious what the Fitbit acquisition will how it will inform what they do with
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.940]   this watch.
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.540]   It could be a really good watch, you know.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:08.340]   Yeah, I'm surprised that they.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.660]   Mark, Mark, Oscar, though, the head of hardware at Google.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:16.340]   Rich consumer hardware, but Rick, I'm sorry, Rick, Oscar said that there were this year
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:20.980]   we're still not going to see a real result of the Fitbit acquisition that won't be until
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:24.460]   like next year, which kind of surprised me because I would have thought that the first
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:28.820]   thing they want to be able to do is let's get all this together to all the hardware
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:34.060]   know how with all of the like pixel styling, all the OS know how that we have.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.060]   So I don't know.
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.060]   We'll find out.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.620]   But like I said, I'm done waiting.
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:43.420]   Again, I'm driving this two stroke engine made out of compressed cotton and people on
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.940]   the auto bonded 180 kilometers an hour with the top down.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.780]   I'm not it's not right.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:52.660]   How much does Apple charge for its Thunderbolt four cable?
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:53.660]   $150.
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:56.620]   Oh, well, okay.
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.220]   So charge your lab on you.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.460]   I tell you something, Leo.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:05.820]   I only buy Thunderbolt cables now because the USB C for a standard has become so unstandardized.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:06.820]   You got to max.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.820]   I don't know what power is anything.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.820]   No, you got to max it out.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.860]   Unless you only wait to actually know that I'm getting what I need to be getting.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.740]   Otherwise I have some problem with charging or some problem with speed.
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:17.500]   It's I might have to order a couple of these.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.060]   This is a hundred fifty nine bucks.
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:25.740]   But on this YouTube tear down charger lab, Tant down, you maybe will have a better idea
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.260]   of why it's so expensive.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:29.380]   They actually took it apart.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:34.500]   And there's a lot of technology inside these this watch.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.300]   It's I mean watch cable.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.940]   This is kind of amazing.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.740]   There's a little computer in that little thing.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:45.460]   Yeah, you got to regulate charging speeds and power output.
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.460]   Yeah, what is it doing?
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:47.460]   Is it?
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.460]   I mean, is wow, it's incredible.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.180]   I mean, it's super easy for like the Intel's and all the companies to say, oh, we'll have
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.460]   all modes and it'll support this charge and that charge.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.540]   Like the cable's got to implement this kind of Intel re-timer chip for Thunderbolt.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.620]   It reduces signal jitter.
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:06.140]   There's a chip marked tiny little silver chip called three CD.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.100]   It's a crystal oscillator.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.180]   So that's for timing, right?
[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:14.820]   There's an infinity on chip there.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.340]   Is that the same infinity that just went on a bed of business?
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.340]   I don't know.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.980]   They were bought by Intel, right?
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:21.980]   Oh, did Intel buy them?
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:22.980]   Okay.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.980]   Okay.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.300]   That power converter I see.
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:28.140]   There's look at all the circuits on here.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.340]   This is incredible.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.860]   So I guess a hundred fifty nine bucks.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:36.660]   But do other Thunderbolt cables not have this stuff?
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.660]   They're not cheap.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.860]   I was looking through Amazon because I literally did.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:41.380]   I bought Thunderbolt cables for everything.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.700]   I bought like a dozen Thunderbolt cables and it was super expensive.
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.740]   Even like the cheapest good ones that I could find.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.100]   Yeah, pretty amazing.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:54.380]   So a charger lab, nice job spending a hundred fifty nine bucks and then taking it apart.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.260]   Well, Alex's previous point, like I would plug in a cable and I would get like very
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.740]   slow if I was trying to copy media back and forth.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:01.740]   It would take forever.
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.180]   You plug in the Thunderbolt cable, it just works.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.180]   A lot of sh*t.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.780]   You don't care what USB it is.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.980]   You don't care what charging speed it is.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:07.980]   It just works.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.180]   So if you buy the Thunderbolt, this is the number four by the way.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.980]   If you buy a Thunderbolt four cable, you know it will step down with every previous technology.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:18.300]   It will support like it's just going to support.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.300]   Yes.
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.300]   Okay.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.140]   Yeah, probably worth buying a couple of those.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.220]   Hundred fifty nine bucks.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.220]   Wow.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.180]   I think I bought Thunderbolt three cables because it was a while.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:29.380]   It was several months ago.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.580]   I don't have any problem with a month.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.580]   I don't want to get it.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:33.580]   Don't write me.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:34.580]   Don't like email me.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:35.820]   Don't bash me on Twitter for saying that.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.820]   I have no problem with them.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.540]   Let me just look on Amazon and see.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.260]   Say there's fifty nine bucks.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:45.460]   Anchor has a Thunderbolt four cable for fifty bucks.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.060]   I think Anchor is the one that I got.
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:53.180]   I like cable matters, but this is a USB four Thunderbolt four, which tells me it's not
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.060]   a Thunderbolt four, right?
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.620]   I don't know.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.620]   USB.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:02.060]   So Thunderbolt USB four supports Thunderbolt or an invoice for a set through an alt mode.
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:04.460]   It's way more complicated than any human should ever have.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.340]   That's insane.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:10.140]   Here's one of the least expensive from other world computing.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:15.800]   Thunderbolt certified one meter, forty gig gigabytes per second data transfer, hundred
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.800]   watt power charging.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.300]   For short cables, it probably doesn't matter.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.260]   If it starts to get the long cables and that kind of stuff, that starts to matter a lot.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.860]   Well, here's the cheapest one so far.
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.860]   Twenty five bucks.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.860]   That's USB four.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.860]   I don't know.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.860]   That's Thunderbolt four.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.860]   I don't know.
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:31.860]   I don't buy for granted.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.860]   I don't know because it's not a question.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.860]   No.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.460]   Oh, here's a really cheap one.
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:38.060]   Nineteen dollars.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.700]   This one doesn't claim certification by anybody.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.220]   Plug-o will make good stuff there.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.540]   They have a Thunderbolt certified cable.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:53.660]   So I guess if I were really, you know, enterprising, I would buy them all, test them.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.940]   Maybe Benson Leung would, we'll take this on.
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:58.380]   Benson, I'm going to put it on you.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.380]   Your job.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.380]   Benson's.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.540]   Well, also it means like if you're just hooking up something and you don't care, like it's
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.540]   fine.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:07.460]   You're like Alex and you're streaming the first meeting with the Vulcans on planet Earth.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.220]   He's going to get the best cable.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:12.220]   We do spend a lot of money on cables.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.260]   Yeah, I bet you do.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.340]   Yeah, I bet you do.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:20.900]   And yeah, you don't want a cheap cable to screw up a big, big shoot.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.980]   You know, and you'd be surprised at how often it comes down to a bad cable somewhere.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.980]   Right.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:27.500]   You know, and that's also why we test so heavily.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.420]   Like, it's like one bad connector, one bad cable, one, someone close the door on one of
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   my cables.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.660]   And you know, and suddenly lost all of them.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:39.900]   No, I'm, you know, Steve Gibson, we were having all sorts of trouble with his connection
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.460]   for ages.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.740]   And you know, Steve said, well, I buy from level four.
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:46.180]   I know it's, you know, I know it's all perfect.
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:50.340]   Turn that was one bad ethernet cable the whole time.
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.540]   And you know, it's hard to find something like that.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:53.540]   But yeah.
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:57.500]   And we learned with HDMI that even if it's not well shielded, like if you want like HDR
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.860]   and you want to be like, you want to be vision and you want to be at most and it's not a
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.260]   shielded cable, doesn't matter that it's certified.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.260]   It's not going to work.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:07.540]   You got to get the more expensive one that shielded because physics is a jerk.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:19.220]   Mac OS server is, I thought they killed it years ago, but it's really, the one that
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:21.220]   is going to be next to the trouble.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:24.460]   I thought that was, I thought that was like, I thought I went to the funeral.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:26.460]   Didn't.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.220]   Anyway, as of April 21st, Apple has discontinued the $20 Mac OS server.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:39.380]   I think you could probably get everything you want by just installing some programs into
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.740]   Monterey.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:48.140]   But anyway, yeah, weird, isn't it?
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.820]   Mac OS server, we hardly knew ye.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:52.100]   We pour one out.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]   Pour one out.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:58.820]   All right, P. Apple watch Mark Gurman's doubling down.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:03.140]   He said this on the show a few weeks ago on his prediction that there will be satellite
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:08.740]   connectivity in the new iPhone and maybe even in the Apple watch.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.740]   I'm urgency.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.740]   I'm urgency.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.740]   I don't like that.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:16.820]   You wouldn't, it's not, you're not going to send text messages to your mom this way.
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:17.820]   Right.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:18.820]   Right.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:23.700]   The company that they, that this rumor is attached to, they make, they make battery
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:30.500]   powered like they're essentially rescue devices that can definitely connect directly to satellites,
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.940]   but they're only sending like 40 character messages.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.380]   Like they're sending location.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.740]   It's an emergency message.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740]   I'm lost.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.740]   Exactly.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:44.140]   And so, and I can, I can sort of get it if it were, if it were an iPhone feature, I'd
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.900]   we'd, then we'd have a discussion on, well, what's the point of this?
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.540]   Why is this so important that they'd want to add this?
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:53.740]   But the thing about doing it in a watch, my goodness.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.420]   I mean, we GPS works because you're just receiving a radio signal.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:03.060]   That's cheap, power wise, sending a signal to a satellite in a low awarding site.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:09.500]   That is going to, like, do you, do you want to send your location or do you want to essentially
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.860]   have navigation to try to help you get off this mountain?
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.580]   I don't, I don't know how useful that could be on a battery as small as what you find
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.580]   on a watch.
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:26.460]   So, Mark does say the iPhone 14 will also feature this emergency satellite connectivity
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:27.460]   features.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:37.220]   He has confirmed what Guo Ming Chi says that the non pro iPhone models will be a 15 based,
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:40.380]   in other words, this year's chip.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:44.140]   Only the new pro models will have the A16 chip.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.900]   I think that one thing we also with the satellite, I think it definitely would be an emergency
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.260]   as Andy's pointing out.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:55.060]   And I think that the big problem you get into is you give no cellular and your phone actually
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.060]   knows where you are.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.260]   It just doesn't know where that is.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:03.140]   So if it, you know, if it could just be able to load just enough for you to kind of get
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:05.660]   a sense of where you are, it would make a huge difference.
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:08.500]   But yeah, it seems like it would be something you'd turn on the Astro-burner and you've got
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.220]   like a half an hour with your phone before it's done.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:15.460]   My understanding is that it's not like a, it's not like a new connectivity type.
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:20.300]   It's an extension of the international 911 like emergency call anywhere thing because
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:24.180]   there's some places where you're just out of carrier and this will let those SOS messages
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.180]   get sent.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.180]   And it will cost a little bit, but like it's better than freezing a death in the tundra.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.180]   Like I worry about it.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:32.540]   And we've had, there have been some people who've had an iPhone that got themselves turned
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:35.500]   around and didn't have connectivity and died.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:40.740]   You know, like in the cars, you know, so, so, so I think that it's, it's a, yeah, it
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.740]   definitely would make a difference.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:42.740]   James Kim.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:43.740]   Yep.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:44.980]   It was a very, very strategy.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.980]   I just had that.
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:46.980]   Boaming Qia is now blogging.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:47.980]   He's got a medium blog.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:48.980]   Like first he was Twittering.
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:49.980]   Now he's blogging.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.480]   What is everyone who used to just publish his reports are supposed to do to make a living
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   now.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.020]   Who thinks about the bloggers?
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.940]   First Mark Gurman does a newsletter now.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.940]   Gwarming Qia.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:29:59.940]   There's a blog.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.380]   My God, what's the world coming to you?
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.380]   On medium.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.380]   On medium.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.380]   Really geeky.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:11.300]   Gurman says that beyond an attempt to differentiate the pro models, the global chip shortage, maybe
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:17.540]   one reason why they are going to be a little hard to get those A16 chips.
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:18.540]   Apple.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.140]   Might also just be the node.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.500]   Like, so they're, they've been, they're having problems.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.140]   Like as you get smaller and smaller, it becomes more and more difficult to make these
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:30.820]   node advances and they were on a, they were on a five nanometer, which is just a marketing
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:31.820]   name.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.820]   It doesn't really mean a measurement.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.540]   So five nanometer and now the current A15s are on the second generation and five P node,
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.340]   which is a more efficient version of that node.
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:43.940]   So they get like five to 10% faster frequencies off of that just because of the increased
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.140]   density and production of all of the chips that come off that node.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:50.060]   They're supposed to be moving to three nanometers, but it sounds like that's been delayed.
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.580]   So they're going to be moving to what they call four nanometers, but it's really like,
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:57.580]   as we got used to with Intel language over the last few years, is really an optimized
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:58.580]   cycle.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:01.940]   So instead of tick, tick, tick, tick, it becomes tick, tick, tick, optimize, tick, tick,
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:02.940]   tick.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:03.940]   So it sounds like that's what we're getting next.
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:07.020]   And that means that Apple's not going to get the kinds of improvements they were hoping
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.020]   for with a three nanometer, which is a real like shrink down where you can put more transistors
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:15.340]   in the same space or the same transistors in less space.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:20.180]   So if they have limited capacity, even of that node, like if TSMC says, we just cannot
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:24.740]   provide enough chipsets to make like a full iPhone order, Apple will have to prioritize
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:27.220]   and say, okay, we'll do the pros on this one.
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.300]   And then we'll we'll stick with a 15 for now.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.540]   So M2 is a 15 related based.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.540]   Yes.
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:39.300]   So, german saying they're also working on an M3, which would be presumably a 16 based
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:40.300]   IMAX.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:44.860]   But that will obviously skip at some point because they're going like every 18 months.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:49.100]   And at some point they're going to skip one like they did with the with the AX chips.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:53.060]   But yeah, so far it looks like the A15 is for the M2 and then we'll see what the M3
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.060]   ends up in.
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.300]   He writes since then I've heard that the M2 chips aren't the only ones in testing with
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.300]   Apple.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:03.140]   And if you're waiting for a new IMAX, german says I'm hearing an M3 version of that desktop
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.300]   is already in the works.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:10.620]   Although I imagine it won't launch until the end of next year at the earliest.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.780]   And he still says an IMAX pro is coming just not.
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.900]   His understanding is like they don't know.
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.860]   And I know people hate that because like Mark like nine to five max said there's horses
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:19.860]   say it's not coming.
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.460]   Mark says his horses say it's coming.
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:24.140]   And the answer is yes, it's shorting his IMAX right now.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:27.460]   Apple put out the max studio and they're waiting to see how we react to it.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.380]   And if it covers the same ground that the IMAX did, they have no need to release an IMAX.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.180]   If it doesn't, if people still feel like there's a market for the IMAX, then they will.
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:38.420]   It's not like the iPhone where they have to have one out every year on the year.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:42.140]   They can afford to sit back and look at the market opportunities and say what fills that.
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.420]   And maybe it'll be a bigger IMAX.
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.340]   I mean, who knows?
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.500]   But there's there's no right answer to that yet because I don't think Apple has decided
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.500]   yet.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:57.620]   He also says a 48 megapixel wide camera exclusive to the iPhone 14 pro.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:04.420]   And a new notch, comprising a pill shaped cut out for face ID and a circular cut out for
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.420]   the camera.
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.540]   So a dual punch, I guess.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:13.660]   Yeah, I wonder what what's going to happen with the rumors about included periscope camera
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.620]   on an upcoming IMAX.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:20.500]   Next year, because that's that's going to be that will be pretty huge when it actually
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:25.780]   happens because that means that you now have you now have enough optical distance between
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:30.380]   the lens and the sensor to actually do a lot of like real book effects to do a lot of
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:33.940]   real zoom effects that you wouldn't be able to do before.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:38.980]   We've mentioned before that the satellite story might be prompted by a satellite company
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:47.780]   trying to, you know, beef up its shares, the global star, which is is the company that
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:54.020]   most people are quoting apparently reached an agreement to buy 17 satellites to support
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:34:00.500]   quote continuous satellite services for a quote potential unnamed client paid hundreds
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.500]   of millions of dollars for that.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:10.980]   So yeah, you know, and that would be interesting if if if Apple decided that it's within our
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:15.300]   interest to have our own satellite constellation, what could Apple thinking?
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:20.220]   What could we do if we have our own constellation to send again, not to not for access to the
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:25.580]   internet, but to send short bursts of information from devices that don't necessarily have to
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.420]   have like big antennas and big battery packs.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:33.220]   I would like I think Apple would be the company to do things as simple as look their people
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.020]   who get lost without cell without cell service.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:39.620]   This will help them save get their lives themselves found and rescued.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:44.380]   But I also wonder what that would do for like an advanced find my network with that would
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:50.820]   do for for for a car system, for instance, where if you don't necessarily have to count
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:58.140]   on having access to a GPS network, don't have to have access to reliable digital internet
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:01.580]   brought, excuse me, mobile broadband, that's that's interesting.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.660]   Apple could do something really interesting with that.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:09.060]   And we have to remember that that getting signals from the satellite is not hard getting
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:13.780]   signals to the satellite is hard.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.660]   So if you have a satellite service that's only receiving data, you know, that's we get
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:17.660]   that with GPS.
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.660]   That's what we're doing.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.660]   We're receiving data.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.860]   So so that's that's a doable thing.
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:25.340]   We have lots of tools that we use to gather data, which are very small devices that don't
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.420]   require a lot of power to get GPS information out.
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.660]   But but to send it back up to the satellite is a big deal.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:35.740]   So I think that it's less of a communicating up and more of a getting something to back
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.740]   down again.
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:40.580]   It's to be so like you can send an alert if you're like lost in the wilderness or if
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:44.220]   you come upon a natural disaster, you can press a button and help report that there
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.580]   is a legitimate natural like is not supposed to be for trivial anything trivial other than
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.340]   life and death.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.460]   Because you talk about the amount of traffic if there are there are a lot of people simply
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:57.340]   press a button and transmit data on that network just on a whim, you know, on an iPhone
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.340]   scale.
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:00.620]   Yeah, you need he'd need more than 17 satellites.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.300]   I think to make that work.
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:11.300]   Elliot Sherrod was flying home with his new wife from their wedding in South Africa to
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:19.380]   their home in the UK when Airlingus lost their bags.
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:24.420]   He then tweeted, perhaps a PowerPoint presentation on the journey.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.500]   You've sent my lost stolen bag on will help.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:32.740]   I've told you multiple times where it is and you're doing nothing about it.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:39.500]   Turns out he had an air tag in the bag knows exactly where the bag is.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:46.340]   So he posted a PowerPoint presentation so Airlingus would finally find his bag and get
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.100]   it back to him.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.500]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.860]   It's nice when you get to be snotty about it.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.740]   Oh, well, that's funny.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.580]   And that's not the first person to do it.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:01.020]   There are people who are also just on if they're shipping something that's kind of valuable.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.020]   They feel as though it doesn't.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:06.300]   It's not that much that much money to spend to simply put an air tag inside the package
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:10.820]   so that if it does get quote lost or if they say, Oh, well, it's it's still in it's still
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:11.820]   in Germany.
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:15.220]   So well, actually, it's according to the air tag that I slipped into it.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.700]   It's actually in Los Angeles.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.500]   So you don't know where it is.
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:25.660]   You ended up in the in the Sherrod's home via career.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:30.620]   Airlingus said he said the bag's stuck in Frankfurt.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:36.060]   Airlingus routed it to London, delivered it to their home address in Surrey at 10 p.m.
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.660]   Oh, but wait, there's only two bags.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.140]   The third is new wife's suitcase containing wedding cards handwritten notes from the lodge
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:50.020]   they stayed at in order of service and itineraries they made for the guest was at a random address
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:53.860]   in Pimlico in central London.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:57.980]   Another messaging he tweeted.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:00.580]   I love this one.
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.580]   Message to airlingus.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.780]   Give me my bag bag.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.340]   I've told you where it is.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.860]   It's now moved a few streets down.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.540]   You've given my bag to someone else.
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:09.540]   This is stolen.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:14.820]   I filed a police report.
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   You know what?
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.860]   The moral of this story is put an air tag in your bag.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.820]   Never mess with Irish John Gruber.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.940]   He doesn't like Jack Gruber, doesn't he?
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.940]   He does.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:25.940]   Let me see here.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:31.020]   The CNN travel says, let's see.
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:34.740]   I'm hoping he got it back.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:38.380]   Nope.
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:42.380]   A couple believe it's been stolen and reported with police and that's the last we've heard
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.380]   of it.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:47.420]   We had a GPS tracker on one of our shipments.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:50.140]   We had a GPS tracker that was someone threw in as a good idea.
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.460]   We were like, oh, see what happens.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:54.780]   We want to see what happens when DHL takes something to Germany.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:58.340]   And they were telling us it was in Berlin and we're like, no, it's in Stuttgart.
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:01.620]   They're like, it's in Berlin and we're like, it's in Stuttgart.
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.900]   We know where that case is.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:08.500]   And we send them a GPS picture of their warehouse with it sitting in the corner.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.140]   They're like, that's where it is.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:12.300]   We needed it in Berlin tomorrow.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.300]   So they sorted it out.
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:15.300]   It was funny.
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.980]   GPS's are powerful.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:22.060]   As long as we're traveling, let's go to Singapore because we've got a new shot on iPhone short
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:28.300]   film shot on the iPhone 13 pro Singapore food from the creator of chef's table, David
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.300]   Gellb.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.780]   Oh boy, get ready to get hungry.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:45.620]   The food in Singapore is amazing because it's an amalgam of Chinese Malaysian, Vietnamese,
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.340]   Southeast Asian cuisine.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.280]   It's so good.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.180]   Oh, so good.
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.740]   So wow, all shot on iPhone got super slow.
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:02.740]   He is the perfect person to do it because he did the, you know, he heard dreams of sushi.
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:06.660]   And so with like a partially with a 5D and a red.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:07.660]   Oh, I didn't.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:08.660]   And then the, oh, yeah.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:10.260]   That's a great very if you haven't seen that boy.
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.260]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:17.060]   And then he did the first couple of episodes, first couple of seasons of chef's table and
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.780]   which is one of my favorite shows on.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:23.300]   And the first season you could tell he was still using some of his 5D stuff.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:26.300]   And then it was like the second season, he was like, and now we'll use Ares.
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:27.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:29.380]   Like money from the old Netflix, did we?
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.380]   Exactly.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:31.380]   Now we're moving on.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:32.740]   The idea of making of, which is great.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:38.980]   There's a three minute companion video where he shows how he made it, shows the rig.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:40.540]   Look at this.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:41.540]   This is awesome.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.540]   Apple should do these every week.
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:43.540]   Just the making of it.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:48.100]   The making of it is so valuable because you can get some great ideas for how to get these
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.100]   shots.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:52.420]   Look, he's an acleur, dry body's got it locked in.
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:53.420]   That's hysterical.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:54.940]   Oh my gosh.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.940]   Wow.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.780]   But you can really get in there.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.180]   I'm not sure it's the best for interviews, but you can really get in there for the food
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.180]   shots.
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:06.340]   My favorite part of the table show is when they had people who worked at the French
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:07.780]   laundry mat with imposter syndrome.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.860]   And you're figuring, if you have imposter syndrome, there's just no hope for the rest
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:11.860]   of us.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.540]   Like you're a 5 star, whatever, a Michelin, Jeff, and you're still worried about your
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:15.540]   stuff.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.540]   You mean French laundry?
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:18.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:19.540]   French laundry, yeah.
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:23.540]   So hungry.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.940]   Stuff like that's going to become more and more relevant now that even in San Francisco,
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:31.060]   you can't be shooting video with anything that doesn't look like a phone because you're
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.740]   going to be robbed at gunpoint.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.740]   Right.
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:34.740]   Right.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.460]   Although, honestly, you're maybe robbed as your phone too.
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:41.980]   I just read about a guy who, two 11 year olds ran up, took his phone and ran off.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:45.140]   So you pretty much don't bring anything to San Francisco's.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.060]   Especially, I mean, this is a little over the top.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:54.140]   But when you think about corporate video, educational video, home video, you can take
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.740]   it an awful long way.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:00.540]   Oh, look, he's doing the rack focus from the chicken to the chef.
[01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:01.540]   Oh.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.460]   That chicken looks amazing.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:05.540]   And he says, look, these are tiny street hawkers.
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.780]   There's no room in there for a camera package.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:14.100]   Well, and you're just a lot of times with a lot of the stuff you can, you just get a
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.100]   lot less of attention.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:20.340]   I shoot with my iPhone all over the world, you know, and it's, and it's, and it, you can
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:22.260]   shoot some great footage with it.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:23.260]   Absolutely.
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:24.260]   It would dribble in the joke.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.260]   Oh, it's kind of.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:29.580]   He's hand holding the phone for a macro shot of chicken with rice.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.580]   You know what?
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.340]   I was, I was just going to boil some noodles tonight.
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:38.380]   I'm getting, getting ear rolls from a neighborhood restaurant.
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:45.020]   It's a, you're, or go to, go to Shumbuia station in Tokyo and get a little sushi.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:46.580]   They probably get a reservation by now.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.580]   Look at that.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.580]   He attached.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:49.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:51.580]   I'm going to have to tell Henry about this.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:52.580]   Pop the record and read that.
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:57.180]   He attached the iPhone to a cleaver.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.180]   Okay.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:02.980]   I'm going to send this to us all.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:03.980]   Hank right now.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:06.620]   What's the IP rating for like chicken guts?
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:12.740]   Could be immersed next to like chicken fat for, for up to 30 minutes or, but now given
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:18.020]   this is funded by Apple, I imagine he had as many iPhones as he needed to make this, make
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.020]   this like Lindsey.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.380]   When he fills up an iPhone, he throws up behind him and walks on with a fresh iPhone.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:23.980]   He's got the footage off.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:24.980]   Look at that.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.940]   He attaches a rig to the tray as he brings.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.420]   I love the cleaver shot.
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:29.420]   That's incredible.
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.420]   This is amazing.
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:31.420]   All right.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:32.420]   Highly recommended.
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:34.340]   It's all on Apple's YouTube channel.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:36.620]   If you Apple, Apple should be showing these.
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:39.940]   They should be, they should be, they should be showing one every week.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.300]   They should take all that footage and put it into final cut and they should release just
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:45.780]   like they do with some of the stuff and logic.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:50.780]   The logic team seems to understand this better than the, the logic you get whole projects
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:52.340]   from Billy Eilish and other folks.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:57.420]   So, they ought to put the whole thing into, into final cut and then just release these
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:02.580]   edits with, here's the final piece, here's the behind the scenes, here's the edits and
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:08.100]   what I would do is even do like a live Q&A with the director and at some point to just
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:11.980]   get everyone into it and then let them, let everyone play with the footage and try to
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:12.980]   do it themselves.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.180]   It'd be really a good idea.
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:16.180]   Nice.
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:22.100]   My friends, I think the time has come for us to take a little time out so that you can
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:28.420]   prepare using any cameras you desire, your picks of the week.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:31.900]   But first a word from ITProTV.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.620]   I talk about ITProTV all the time.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:37.780]   It's the place to go if you want to get a job in IT or if you're already working in IT
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:41.740]   and you want to perfect some skills, get re-certified, that kind of thing.
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:47.460]   But I also really think it's important that any business with an IT team should know, ITProTV
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:52.300]   has great training for your IT team as well.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.380]   They need the skills and knowledge to make sure your business is a success and ITProTV
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:00.220]   has content they will love.
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.980]   It's engaging, they're learning.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.580]   80% of ITProTV users who start a video finish it.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.580]   It's that good.
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.140]   And the video is by the way, 20 to 30 minutes, you can watch them during a break, you can
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.900]   watch them at lunch, you can listen in the car ride home, give your team the tools they
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.500]   need to make your business thrive.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.780]   Of course, they're entertaining, they're binge worthy.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:29.340]   Your team will respond and you'll get the benefit of a highly trained IT professional.
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:32.340]   You can get all the training inserts for your team done in one place.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:35.820]   They have every vendor, every skill you need for IT team training.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:44.220]   Microsoft IT, Cisco, Linux, Apple, security, cloud, 5,800 hours ranging from technical
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:49.500]   skills to compliance, even as soft skills, business skills, marketing skills as well.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:53.900]   And the business plan means you get a dashboard that lets you track your team's results.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:59.180]   You can manage your seats, assign and unassign team members very granularly too.
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:05.100]   You can access monthly usage reports, metrics like logins and viewing time and tracks completed.
[01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:10.260]   You can create subsets of your users, providing them with customized assignments.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:14.340]   It's great to be able to monitor their progress, to see if they're using it, to see if you're
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.940]   getting your return on investment I guarantee you will be.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:23.180]   The assignments can be as of course a full course, but they can be individual episodes
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:24.620]   within courses even.
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:30.700]   Because IT Pro TV publishes full transcripts of every single episode, you can easily find
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.580]   the part you need, jump to what you need to learn.
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:36.980]   And the reporting you're going to get will really give you insight into your team's viewing
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:39.620]   patterns, their progress.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:45.860]   Social plans, yes, but business, you should check out IT Pro TV for developing your IT
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.860]   team.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.380]   Give your team the IT development platform they need to level up their skills while
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.700]   enjoying the journey.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:58.340]   For teams from 2 to 1,000 volume discounts started at 5 seats, but we've got an even
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:07.580]   better discount, go to itpro.tv/macbreak and mention Macbreak 30 to your account executive
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:11.340]   for 30% off or more on a business plan.
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:17.460]   Macbreak 30 is the offer code ITPro.tv/macbreak.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:21.180]   Individual users, you should use Macbreak 30 as well, you'll get a 30% discount too.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.100]   I think IT Pro TV is the best.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.820]   I think you will think so too.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:29.180]   If you love IT, you want to get into IT or if you've got an IT team that needs training,
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:33.060]   ITPro.tv/macbreak.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:37.180]   And again, the offer code, please use it too because you're going to get a great break
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:43.180]   and we get credit when you do Macbreak 30.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:48.780]   Time for Andy's pick of the week.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:50.700]   Mine is something that really helps.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:54.620]   It's a development tool that really helps me out because I'm a dab leader when it comes
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:55.940]   to software development.
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:58.380]   I have an idea for something that I want to build.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:03.340]   I've built lots of apps, lots of code, but not enough that I've become proficient at
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:07.980]   anything so I kind of have to start from square one almost always again.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:14.020]   And one of the problems I've always had is dealing with API servers.
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:17.380]   One of the things I want to build is I want to build, there are a lot of apps for the
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:22.380]   phone that will tell you when the next train is coming or for transit and stuff like that.
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:23.380]   I don't want that.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:27.780]   I just want one that simply tells me that knows that I'm waiting for this specific train
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:31.820]   on this line of the commuter rail station and I want to try to figure out what I want to
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:36.540]   basically a widget that simply says, "Here is the track that the train that you're waiting
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.540]   for is going to be on."
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:43.180]   And the MBTA system has a really great set of APIs for that, but I'm not familiar with
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:44.980]   interacting with API servers.
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:48.540]   So there's a lot of trial and error to figure out just how this system works.
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:52.380]   So I found this really great tool that's used by professionals called Postman.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.860]   You've got to postman.com.
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:58.780]   And it is like a GUI for these API requests.
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:48:59.780]   That's so cool.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.780]   Wow.
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:07.300]   So instead of sending this really weirdly formatted curl request in the terminal, it is just here
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:10.060]   is the URL of where that API is.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:14.020]   Here's basically a table that lists all the parameters.
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.060]   You need to feed it.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:18.380]   You basically give it the variables that you think is going to give you the result you
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.380]   want.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:22.780]   You click a button and then it shows you what the server sent and kick you back.
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:27.540]   And so for that, basically what it means is that over the course of maybe one evening,
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:32.340]   I was able to figure out, "Okay, if I want to get this information from the MBTA's API
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:34.740]   server, here's the request that I have to make."
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:37.860]   And now that goes into Swift or that goes into my development environment.
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.620]   At least I know that that is a solved thing.
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:44.660]   If this thing is not working, it's not because I don't understand how to send a request.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:50.140]   And once you start using it and you start realizing that it'll work with anything, but
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:53.220]   it also knows about Twitter's APIs.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.500]   It knows about APIs for a whole bunch of different services.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:00.060]   So if you want to see, "Gee, I wonder what I could do with getting alerts from Twitter.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.540]   If I want to write that into an app," you can just play with it.
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:07.980]   And it's just so much fun to just figure out that instead of using the GraphQL interface
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:12.460]   that was provided to you by this service to suddenly build your own tools, even if it
[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:18.540]   doesn't do nearly as much as the Twitter client does, it's fun to basically create stuff that
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.700]   invokes the genie on your own.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:26.460]   So if you're using it for real app development with teams, it costs money for individuals,
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.620]   for quick stuff, it costs nothing.
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:31.060]   There's a Mac client, there's also a web client.
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:37.140]   But if you've ever had a curiosity about how apps talk to services, get information from
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:41.140]   that service, get sent information that service, it's a fun thing to play with.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.500]   Very cool.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.820]   What do you, I didn't know you do this.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:48.500]   So do you have a little box on your wall that says when the next train is or something like
[01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:49.660]   that?
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:56.420]   I have a little hand-held, like little square thing with a screen that I bought from AWS
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:51:01.020]   and it's a great amount of data fruit that runs Python or Circuit Python.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:05.780]   And so what I want to do is I just want to have this tiny little poster stamp little
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:14.260]   thing that just simply says next train on the Providence Stone line is at 730.
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.540]   It will be departing on track eight.
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:18.300]   That's so cool.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:23.100]   Because it doesn't give you, the thing is the API does not give you the track information,
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:29.420]   but there is like the railroad yard has its own little API system.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:34.220]   So if you basically do some calculated guesses, you can basically say there's a really good
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.340]   chance that it's going to be track eight this time.
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:39.580]   So while I'm waiting for 20 minutes, I want to have something to do.
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:43.380]   So I kind of want to be like the James Bond or the James Bond villain who has this little
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:47.340]   thing in his palm that just simply, I know it would be easier to do it as an app, but
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:51.340]   it wouldn't be as cool as have this dedicated device that does nothing but just gives,
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:53.900]   here's the number, here's the, it gives you a baby.
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.660]   Hey, I've got the information for you.
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:56.660]   How funny.
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.860]   It's a wonderful waste of time and resources.
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:00.860]   Oh no, that's what programming is all about.
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:01.860]   Exactly.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.780]   Yeah, that's your brand.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:08.700]   Postman, now I was showing it, it said Linux download because I'm on a Linux machine, but
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:13.100]   they have it for a Mac OS 4M1 as well as Intel.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.300]   Very cool, very neat.
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:17.020]   And there's a web interface as well.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.060]   Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week.
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:25.060]   Yeah, but once a year I get to recommend some great upgrade from Max on Cinema 40.
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.700]   I've been using Cinema 40 on and off for over 20 years now.
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:34.260]   And it is, I think the best all around 3D package out there right now.
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:36.700]   And there's a lot of great packages.
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.500]   There's really high end stuff in my end, Houdini and so on and so forth, but something
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:45.020]   that's approachable that you can still produce just incredible graphics on.
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:49.540]   Cinema 40 does everything from realistic to broadcast and broadcast graphics they've
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:53.940]   kind of taken over by really paying attention to what a lot of us need for those kinds
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.620]   of looks.
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:53:01.220]   And so it's just really evolved and they just announced last week the upgrades.
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:05.340]   And one of the things that they did for people like me who are playing around with photogrammetry
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:08.100]   is that they took the Z-remesher.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:12.180]   So Max on of course bought ZBrush.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:18.940]   And so they have now taken what we all use to basically rebuild our surfaces.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:23.380]   So when you shoot something in photogrammetry, you end up with way more polygons, way more
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.060]   geometry than you need.
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:28.740]   And how do you smartly reduce that so that you still have all the detail, but you don't
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:30.060]   have more weight.
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:34.460]   And so they took, for years, what we've done is we've taken our scans and we take them
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:40.140]   into ZBrush and we use the Z-remesher to, or we've used the Z tools to basically pull
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:41.140]   that back.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:45.100]   And Max on has now put that into Cinema 4D so that you can just do it while you're there.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:49.780]   They also have a lot of upgrades to their cloth simulators as well.
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:54.620]   And Redshift, which is a renderer that they bought as well.
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:57.060]   They're now incorporating into everything that they're doing, which just makes it a
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:58.860]   lot easier to work with.
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:05.100]   The best one though, this is not part of Cinema 4D, but it's really good is the VFX suite,
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.460]   you have to see the video of it.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:12.060]   They built, a lot of us, we talk about lens flares and in the old days you'd simulate
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:16.180]   a lens, you'd create a lens flare that had these little stars and everything else.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:21.180]   They now have a real lens flare that actually calculates through different lenses, calculates
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:26.140]   the light path so that you can get the lens flare that matches that lens.
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:32.980]   Like it's for people like me who look at over the top solutions, that's over the top.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:33.980]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.780]   It's really cool.
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:40.380]   So anyway, it's just, and I've gotten to watch, I can still remember there was this little
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:43.860]   3D chain that you moved around and we were at Lucasfilm just going, "I can't believe
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.460]   we're doing this in real time on a minute."
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:48.460]   And that was probably 1997.
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:51.500]   So it's been a long time, 25 years now.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:58.700]   And I think that what I like about it is that it's a German company and it's really
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:00.300]   German engineering when it comes to it.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:01.300]   I mean, things are just solid.
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.380]   It takes a long time for them to put out a feature and then it just works.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:10.940]   And so it's pretty powerful.
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.140]   They've just progressed very well.
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.340]   And now they're absorbing companies.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:17.900]   One thing to note is if you're a student or a teacher, you definitely want to pay attention
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:19.660]   to their subscription services.
[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:25.020]   So while they're doing subscription like everybody else, and for a commercial entity,
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.020]   it's expensive.
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:29.780]   If you're making money with 3D, it costs money.
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:32.180]   But it's actually not that expensive.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.180]   $7 and $91 bucks a year is not horrific.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:36.660]   Yeah, if you get it all at one time, it's not horrific.
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:37.980]   No, I'm just saying that it's not.
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:42.980]   But if you go to look at student teachers, it's $10 every six months.
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:43.980]   It's amazing.
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.980]   $20.
[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:45.980]   Super aggressive.
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:46.980]   And that's for everything.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:47.980]   That's max on one.
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:48.980]   That's not just...
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:52.380]   So very, very aggressive for educators and students.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:57.180]   And I think that there's a lot of arguments to get Blender and so on and so forth.
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:59.380]   And I think Blender is a powerful tool.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:01.420]   And if you're in a commercial entity, I think that makes sense.
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:05.220]   If you're learning this and you are a student somewhere, I think you're going to go a lot
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:07.540]   further with cinema.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:10.940]   And you can get into it relatively very inexpensively as a student.
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:15.460]   And even then, I think as an all-around app, it's probably one of the best out there.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:19.580]   How strict are they about their definition of student?
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:23.940]   If I'm learning 4D, cinema 4D, is that my students?
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:25.700]   I think you have to be enrolled.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.700]   They're using a service.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.380]   So I think that you do have to be enrolled in a school to make that application.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:32.700]   To address or something like that.
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:34.700]   I think they're either a teacher.
[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:36.500]   But they've really done a lot.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:38.460]   And they do so many videos.
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:40.420]   They're doing videos all this week.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.660]   They just understand that they have to educate their audience.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:48.740]   And so the wet wear development of what they do is as good as the software development.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:52.780]   They're doing seminars and conferences like every...
[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:55.060]   It feels like every week.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:58.420]   And then during NAB and Sea Graph, they're doing them every day, like all day.
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.260]   And so right now, if you go there, you'll see all these videos that they're putting up
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:02.420]   on YouTube.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.820]   They're streaming live from the NAB floor.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:05.820]   Wow.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:06.820]   It's a really...
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:11.220]   Anyway, it's a great, really well-run company as well as...
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:12.620]   And they're really expanding right now.
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:14.780]   So it's definitely worth checking out.
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:15.780]   Nice.
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:18.980]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:22.420]   So I got a two for Tuesday for everybody.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:25.580]   The first is I love when creators make really interesting stuff.
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:26.660]   And I love to help them promote it.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:32.460]   MKBHD, Marquez Brownlee, has worked with Motion VFX, which is some of the best plugins available
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:35.580]   for Final Cut and for Resolve and for Premiere.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:42.100]   And they've made a set of plugins that help you make sort of MKBHD style videos, which
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.100]   has some pros and cons.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:47.180]   I mean, everything defaults to being very much his palette and his style.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:49.340]   But they are highly, highly configurable.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:52.460]   So if you like certain things that he does, but you want to put your own flair, your own
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:55.300]   take on them, you can use those as starting blocks.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.980]   You might have to hand animate or re-engineer, like reinvent all those wheels.
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:04.820]   So there's just a bunch of stuff inside here that let you do a lot of Marquez-y sort of
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.820]   things.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:09.060]   Again, he does it in Final Cut, but they have it for all versions.
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:11.460]   And right now, I don't know how long it's going to last, but they're having a flash
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.420]   sale where a lot of the plugins are 50% off and they make some of the plugins I use all
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.420]   the time.
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.340]   I mean, a lot of YouTubers use them all the time.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:21.540]   If you're an Alex Lindsay-level genius, you can open them up in motion and customize them
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:22.540]   completely.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.660]   So you can still even just in your editor, you can do a ton of customization with them.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:32.940]   And there's grungy ones and cinematic ones and cyberpunk ones and transitions and logo
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.940]   effects.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940]   Just everything.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:37.420]   They have a bunch of tuber packs where you can get a bunch of buttons that are common
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:39.180]   for YouTuber things.
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:43.340]   It's just a lot of really good, really powerful, really effective stuff for not a lot of money
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:45.860]   and we'll save you a ton of work.
[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:46.860]   So it's all.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:48.940]   Yeah, this is what I use for a lot of stuff that I do.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:52.420]   So like motion-free effects is the they are, I mean, because you can open it up in
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:55.900]   motion and all the layers are there and all the bits and pieces.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.860]   And now you have to figure out how they did it because they know motion better than anyone
[01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:03.140]   I've ever seen except for maybe, you know, like Alex, Forti, Golnar and Mark Spencer.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:05.380]   But outside of that, I don't know anybody that knows it as well as they do.
[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:09.820]   And they, you know, it's just amazing what they put together.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.940]   The artwork and the designs are just stunning.
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:15.700]   If you're trying to find something, just you just wanted to look professional.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:19.380]   You just want to throw it in Renee's spot on its incredible value.
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:24.460]   79 bucks during the flash sale for the MKBHD plugins.
[01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:25.940]   Very cool.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:29.580]   And you probably, motion's free if you have a Mac or do you have to buy motion?
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:30.580]   Yeah, it's $50.
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:32.660]   It's the best $50.
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.660]   That's as good as free.
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.420]   I just built a countdown clock.
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:39.220]   I built countdown clocks in motion and they take me about 10 minutes to build.
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:44.740]   But I customize them so they look exactly like they fit into the poster frame that we're
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:46.340]   using and everything else.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:50.420]   And I did it in about 10 or 15 minutes and I was like, if motion only sold itself as
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:55.380]   a countdown clock tool for $50 worth it, you know, and then it does all these other things
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:57.060]   that are great too.
[01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.380]   It's funny you should mention it.
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.780]   I was banging my head trying to figure out, "Gee, you know what?
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:02.580]   I wish there were a really good app.
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:06.580]   Like I only want it as a clock app that will be like a floating window always on top of
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:09.900]   everything else so that when I'm doing a podcast or whether when I'm moderating a panel, like
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:14.380]   in front of a crowd of people, it will just, I just want like a clear day, how much time
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:15.980]   I've been going on.
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:17.220]   And then suddenly I realized, "Oh, wait a minute.
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:23.100]   I have motion so I can just like do a motion graphic of like a timer that goes from like
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:30.340]   zero minutes to two hours, save that as a video and then just simply use the built in
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:35.500]   like a picture-in-picture player to simply whatever app I'm using, whether it's on the
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:40.220]   my iPad or on the Macbook, it will always just be exactly what I want it to be.
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:43.060]   It's a clock that will be floating on top of everything else."
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:48.060]   And like you said, and I'm not a presentation or graphics professional like you, it's just
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:52.340]   like I just have motion, it's fun to screw around with, it's easy to play around with,
[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:57.580]   and it's the, it's, actually I want to end it there, it's fun to play with.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:01.340]   You don't need to have a reason to use it, it's like a spirograph, it's like an etch a
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:05.060]   sketch, it's like a light bright, mess around with it and have fun.
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:06.460]   3D text, that's all I want to say.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:08.580]   I do countdown clocks and I'm like, "I wonder what this looks."
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:11.980]   Even if I don't do them in 3D, I just like turn them on, like how about a countdown clock
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.940]   in 3D, and then I go back to whatever I'm doing, but I was like, "But I can do it 3D."
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:16.940]   So it's really good.
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:17.940]   It's nice.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:18.940]   Incredible app.
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:19.940]   Nice.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:20.860]   Very fun.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:27.980]   Well, I think we've run out of time now, so I guess I'll let you go, but it's been a grand
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:31.700]   show with only the smallest amount of Twitter in it.
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:34.020]   ReneeRitchie at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:41.700]   When we're going to get the ReneeRitchie motion VFX kit, I want to look like you, dude.
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.700]   I've actually been experimenting.
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.100]   I talked to you about this.
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.220]   I talked to Andy about this in the past.
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:48.100]   I did a video last week where there was nothing.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:49.100]   It was pure A-roll.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:50.260]   I just sat there and talked.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:53.820]   I want to get better at storytelling, and it has some of the best retention of any video
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:54.820]   I've ever made.
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:59.700]   So I love that I learned B-roll and I learned all this stuff, but I don't have to use it.
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:01.260]   If I can just get really good at all the...
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:03.100]   Well, you're a past master at this, Leo.
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:05.100]   Just holding people's attention to the audience.
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:06.100]   I'm just lazy.
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:07.100]   I don't want buttons.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:08.100]   No, not at all.
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:12.260]   I'm knobs and no transitions for me.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:15.020]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:17.020]   He is far from lazy.
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.020]   I'll tell you that right now.
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.020]   I just put up this morning.
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:20.020]   I put up my Mac Pro.
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:21.460]   I was trying to figure out what Apple could actually...
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.380]   Because the only differentiation for a Mac Pro that's left is extensibility.
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:25.620]   That's expandability.
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:27.740]   So John's looking for some good transitions.
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:28.740]   What can we do?
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:31.260]   John, you have those coins or something fun we can do.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.260]   You get the...
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:33.260]   No, no.
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.380]   We can sell the Leo Laporte transition kit.
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:38.260]   That's the classic Lucasfilm wipe.
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:40.340]   That's the classic.
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:42.900]   Just a slide across the screen.
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:43.900]   We just use the standard...
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:44.900]   Oh, look at that.
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:45.900]   Huh?
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:48.300]   Transitions from the Tri-Kaster.
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:49.700]   That's about as far as I want to go.
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:50.700]   Make it fun.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:54.700]   Andy and Akko, what are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:57.180]   Once again, I'm on a day early this week.
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:00.420]   Thursday at 12.30 in the afternoon, eastern time.
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:04.980]   Go to wgphnews.org to stream it live or later.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.580]   And we don't mention it enough, but if you're interested in the new Pixel Watch or anything
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:14.580]   Android, Andy has a great Android show called Material on Relay.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:18.420]   Yes, the Material Podcast, which we should do with the great Florence Ion, which has
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:22.220]   also been on many Android podcasts here on Twitch.
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:25.580]   Pretty much all of our staff has a podcast on Relay.fm.
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:29.420]   I don't know if I should feel bad about that or not, but yeah.
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:30.420]   Very nice.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.780]   Good on you and it's must listen.
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:35.860]   Fortunately, we screwed up.
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:40.900]   Our hopes was that we'd rate a big war between two podcasts tightened.
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:45.140]   Unfortunately, the heads, both of these ports are nice people who are pretty happy.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:47.980]   Mike Hurley, share their talent with other people.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:48.980]   His good.
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.140]   He's a good man.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.140]   Thank you.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:53.140]   As are you.
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.140]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:04:00.220]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, Office Hours.global is the global nonprofit ONXWipe.
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:09.100]   The global nonprofit hero of anybody who's making content or hamburgers.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:10.940]   Office Hours.global.
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:12.780]   We're having so much fun.
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:14.420]   We covered NAB yesterday.
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:16.380]   Just the whole bunch of people just decided they wanted to do it.
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:20.100]   We did a rocket launch a couple of weeks ago and then we're looking at new conferences
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:23.260]   going forward, but we just decided, hey, let's call it to do something together.
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:26.780]   We learned so much about production together by working on it.
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:28.420]   It's just the best way to meet people.
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:29.420]   And it runs 24/7.
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:33.740]   If we're not talking about it in Office Hours, we're hanging out and talking about it in
[02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:34.740]   after hours.
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:36.780]   It's definitely worth checking out.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:37.780]   Office Hours.global.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.900]   I didn't get your--
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:39.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:40.900]   Outstanding.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:41.900]   I didn't get your--
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:42.900]   Sunday.
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:44.940]   I didn't get your NAB.
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:50.660]   Pracy, I'm sorry to say, but you can get it from Office Hours.global.
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:53.540]   And I don't know, but it looks like you've got Robert De Niro on the show.
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:54.540]   So that's pretty exciting.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:55.540]   That's going to be good.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:05:00.540]   It's going to be good.
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:08.100]   And if you want to hire Alex to do the best darn productions out there, 090.media is the
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:10.220]   place to go.
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.220]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.220]   Thank you, Anthony.
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:13.820]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:15.660]   Thank all of you for joining us.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:17.900]   We do Mac Break Weekly of a Tuesday.
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:19.060]   Brando Lemonam Pacific.
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:20.060]   That's 2 p.m.
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:21.260]   Eastern, 1800 UTC.
[02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:28.300]   I mentioned that because you can watch us or listen to us live at live.twit.tv.
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:29.620]   It's always streaming something.
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:33.140]   And when there's live shows in production, you can listen to those.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:35.580]   People who watch live often like to chat with one another.
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:36.940]   So we've got a couple of ways to do that.
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:43.340]   Of course, the community run IRC is at irc.twit.tv.
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:47.140]   We also have a fantastic Discord.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:52.940]   But that is not free.
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:55.860]   I think club twits a great deal at $7 a month.
[02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:58.260]   You get ad free versions of all the shows.
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:02.220]   We don't have to show you ads, not even this one, because you're giving us a little bit
[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:03.420]   of money.
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:06.700]   You also get access to the Discord, which is, by the way, not just discussions of the
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:07.700]   shows.
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:16.900]   It's all kinds of stuff, whether it's books or coding or anime or data science or ham
[02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:18.260]   radio.
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.940]   It's all in there.
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.580]   We also have events in there.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:25.740]   We did ask me anything with Jeff Jarvis and Paul Therat last month.
[02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:28.300]   Let me see what's coming up in our event calendar.
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:33.620]   Ah, one of our best editors, John Ashley, will be doing an inside twit this week on Thursday.
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:38.380]   Scott Wilkinson on May Day, may I rather say go to my on May 5th.
[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:43.380]   And something we've just announced, Father Robert Ballis Airfire, side chat on May 12th.
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.620]   And of course, Stacy's book club is coming up a little later in June.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:53.820]   Now all of this is available to club members, either live or on the feed, the Twit Plus
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:58.940]   feed, $7 a month, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:01.140]   All aboard everybody.
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:06.220]   The club twit train is about to pull out of the station.
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:10.740]   If you want, now I have to say, we do have free versions of all the shows ad supported.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:16.580]   As always, at twit.tv, in the case of this show, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:19.180]   You can also get it on YouTube.
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:23.660]   There's a YouTube channel for this show and all of our shows dedicated.
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:25.980]   And you can subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:29.100]   And if you do that, you hit it automatically so you don't have to think about it.
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:34.420]   If your podcast player supports reviews, please leave us a five star review.
[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:37.860]   Let the world know about Mac break weekly.
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.860]   Since, what do you say, Alex?
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:42.860]   2002 since 2003?
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:43.860]   2004?
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:45.500]   What do you think was our first?
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:47.500]   I think 2004, I want to say.
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:49.500]   For Mac break.
[02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:50.500]   Mac break?
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:52.460]   No, Mac break, I don't think was until 2000.
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:53.860]   I want to say 2005.
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:54.860]   Okay.
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:55.860]   I think we did Mac break minutes.
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:58.220]   I think we did Mac break minutes in 2005.
[02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:01.500]   And I think our first official Mac break was, I can't remember.
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:04.020]   It was January 2005 or January 2006.
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:05.020]   Pre-Obama.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:07.820]   That was for someone could tell us.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:08.820]   That was flippant.
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:14.300]   The first one was with, yeah, exactly you and I and Amber and Emory Wells.
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:17.020]   Hey, do you know how Amber's doing, by the way?
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.580]   Have you heard?
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:19.580]   She okay?
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:20.580]   Amber?
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:21.580]   Not Amber.
[02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:23.540]   I just see who is also just.
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:24.540]   She okay.
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:25.540]   She's doing better.
[02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:26.540]   Oh, good.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:27.540]   She's improving.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:28.540]   Yeah.
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:33.140]   We've been the first audio Mac break weekly, the WWDC aftermath with Amber and David Poe, Chris
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:36.980]   Breen and you was August 12th, 2006.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:40.420]   To remind me, Alex will have to have a little party in August.
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:41.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.260]   Sorry, our 16th anniversary.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:45.620]   Thanks for joining us everybody.
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:50.980]   And now as I have said for the last 16 years, it's time to get back to work because break
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.620]   time is over.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:54.060]   Bye bye.
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.420]   Is that an iPhone in your hand?
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:56.820]   Wait a second.
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:59.740]   Is that an Apple watch on your wrist?
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:02.740]   And do I see an iPad sitting there on the table?
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:04.220]   Oh my goodness.
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:09.900]   You are the perfect person to be watching iOS today, the show where Rosemary Orchard
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:15.820]   and I, Mike Asargent, talk all things iOS, TV, OS, watch, OS, HomePod, OS.
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:18.260]   It's all the OS that Apple has on offer.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:20.780]   And we show you how to make the most of those gadgets.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:35.500]   Head to twit.tv/ios to check it out.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:38.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
