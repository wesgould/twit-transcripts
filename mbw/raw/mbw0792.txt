[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.560]   A judge has ordered Apple to allow external payment options.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.480]   We'll get a little battle over that.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.240]   Apple's sticking taxpayers with the costs
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.840]   for their digital ID cards.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.320]   What's wrong with that?
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.200]   And the legacy contact feature that will allow your family

[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   Apple, Apple.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.320]   Here joining us, not from space, but from Montreal,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.640]   Renee Ritchie, YouTube.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.320]   Star.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.880]   We're getting snow, Leo.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.760]   It's begun.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.080]   The winter has come.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080]   Is this the wall?
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.600]   No.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.000]   You guys have already had you Thanksgiving, am I wrong?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   No, usually we got snow way earlier.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.920]   I remember always being snowed in for Halloween.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320]   But thank you guys for heating up the earth
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.840]   so that now we're a balmy.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.040]   In the November winter people.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.760]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   See?
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's getting more desirable live in Montreal.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.120]   Also, Andy and Ico from the great New England.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.600]   In our code.com.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.400]   It's not snowing.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.440]   It's crisp.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.240]   I like fall weather, actually.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.400]   Yes, exactly.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.720]   We started-- it's that wonderful three-week transition
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.000]   period where you get to sleep on top of one comforter
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.160]   and under another comforter in the bed.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.280]   And you never want to get out of bed ever.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.400]   And it's not so cold that you either turn up the heat
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.560]   till 93 or just sit there all day and suffer.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.600]   So this is like three weeks.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.320]   I'm really enjoying it.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   That's why the inventors get us out of bed.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.440]   No, this is why the electric tea kettle
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.960]   that you can actually keep on the nightstand so that--
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   Yes.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.480]   --all I can do is let some sort of like visceroy
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.360]   or some sort of feudal lord just like--
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.600]   I'll reach out one hand, flip on the switch,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.800]   then two minutes later pour myself tea.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.400]   And again, I'm just a very, very fancy, fancy young lord.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.840]   Also here, Alex Lindsey from Office Hours.Global
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.400]   and 090.media.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.920]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.240]   It's not snowing here.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.800]   Not snowing here.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.240]   Glad to see you guys.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.160]   We had the most amazing clouds this morning.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.120]   It was great.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.040]   I know it's fall because my animal crossing tree
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.120]   leaves have turned brown.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.560]   So that's a--
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.720]   I got red.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.480]   One of them mines turned red.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.400]   I have one tree that's red.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.560]   Oh, you're turning up time.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.000]   My turnips are facing a very high price.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.280]   Alex clearly is no fan of animal crossing.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.560]   It's a game, Alex.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.920]   You just wouldn't understand.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.200]   By the way, is it like Kingdom Rush?
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.720]   No.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.320]   No, that's not.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.440]   No, that's the only one I know.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   That's the only one I know.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.760]   That's involved at all.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.560]   That's all I play.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.760]   Reverb Mike, who is our antiquarian quote expert,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.360]   says this is also the day that Billy Joe McAllister jumped
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.760]   off the Talahatchee Bridge.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.560]   So, yeah.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.440]   I'm hoping that the day that Felix Unger was asked to leave
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   his apartment on November 13th, I'm actually now marking that
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.560]   as a national thing.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   A special day.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.480]   Somebody tweeted that out because of the long form introduction
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   to the odd couples on November 13th.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.560]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.080]   On November 13th, Felix Unger was asked to leave his home
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.040]   by his request, came from his wife.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.280]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.160]   I don't know how to mark that, but I'm going to mark that
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.760]   every year now.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.400]   Actually, yesterday was a fairly important but unmarked
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.320]   anniversary.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.680]   It was the 50th anniversary of the creation of the 4,000
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   four microprocessor.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   And that actually was pretty important because that was
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.920]   really the first microprocessor.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.480]   Until did it--
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.640]   Look at that.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.840]   I think it has an actual--
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.040]   It's going to be a million nanometer.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.520]   A million nanometer.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.920]   A million nanometer.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.280]   It looks like a nanometer.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.860]   Well, when you smell cedar, you've got an overheating problem.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.360]   That's the--
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.260]   It was a saving future.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.360]   It's like a needle, doesn't it?
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.440]   It does, has a certain--
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.200]   It looks like a ice cream sandwich on top of a chip.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.240]   50th anniversary is a big one.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.940]   This was the chip that Intel didn't even want to do, I think.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.360]   But it has--
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.360]   Get ready for this.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.340]   How many transistors in the M1 Pro or M1 in the mix?
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.600]   11 billion or something.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.360]   I think it was 37 billion.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.080]   It's some of the--
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.400]   Yeah, 56 billion, yeah.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.560]   There were 2,300 transistors in the 4,000.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   4.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.520]   They made it--
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.240]   It was punch them out with a pencil each one separately.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.360]   Practically.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.880]   They made it for a calculator.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.520]   It was the Nippon Calculating Machine Company
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.080]   asked them to design it in 1969 for a printing calculator.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.960]   And instead of designing as that-- at the time they did--
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.640]   special purpose chips, calculator chips, they said,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.040]   well, what if we did a general purpose chip
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.840]   that you could have a program that would turn it
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.280]   into a calculator?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.160]   That was the 4,000.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.960]   4 and really began a transformation of technology.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.600]   The history is not just about innovation,
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.240]   but making that stuff available to people who could then
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.520]   do really wonderful and inventive things with--
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.280]   the 6502 was incredibly important, chiefly because now
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.440]   an engineer like Woz could just buy it.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   It was so fast.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.240]   Buy this one CPU.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.360]   And then instead of having to do a TTL logic for everything,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.960]   and that's what caused that explosion.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.840]   So it's really, really, very, very cool.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.960]   The clock speed of the 4,000 4 was 750 kilohertz.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.520]   It could do 92,000 operations a second,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.640]   comparing that to the M1 Max, which
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.280]   does 10.4 trillion floating point operations.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.160]   You could watch the electrons move through the circuit.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.920]   Exactly.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.120]   According to the journal, and I'm going to trust their math
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.560]   because they're wonks, that's a billion fold increasing
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.720]   computer power in 50 years.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   Take that more.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.120]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.840]   And my favorite piece of technology connection,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.720]   sort of like explanation, is that this all comes down.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.360]   This all goes back to the printing press.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   This is all about how fine a line can you print on an object.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.320]   And that has been the constraint in the development
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.400]   of microprocessors, that from a very, very simple process
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.280]   to now we need a way to make a line on a piece of thing
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.240]   about twice as wide as an electron.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.040]   We're hoping to get it down to 1.23 times as wide
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.960]   as an electron.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.120]   And that's to get more and more transitions
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.480]   onto a practical amount of surface.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.040]   So happy birthday to the-- basically the microprocessor
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.640]   industry and Intel.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.960]   50 years and a long time.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.920]   Time to retire until you can sit back for a long time.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.560]   It's a good time to be like the British Empire
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.960]   around like 1968, '89.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.040]   Just sit back, think about, you know,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.880]   there was a time when we ruled everything
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.560]   where we were just the most important factor
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   in the entire world.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.960]   And no.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.320]   Let's watch another dancing people in clean suit video
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.720]   from 1993.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.160]   Remember when Apple was grateful for our business?
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.360]   Remember when Apple says, thank God,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.400]   you're saving us for most of our stories.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.440]   Just watch your stories.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.920]   I wonder if I could find an Intel ad from the early '70s.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   That would be kind of cool.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.880]   I don't think--
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.840]   What are you going to do?
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.240]   Design your own CPU as if?
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.720]   Here's all the Intel commercials from the past to the present.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.480]   It's only 26 minutes, so it's not going to take that long.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.560]   I'm curious what the--
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.880]   Does that include the bunny suit?
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.400]   Is it the bunny suit?
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   You see computers?
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.760]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   Who's sunsparked?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.360]   It's 46.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.440]   This can't be the first one.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.480]   It must go back further.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.840]   It must make it easy for you to turn three things faster.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.520]   The 46.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.720]   No, I'm curious, of course, for its floating point
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.880]   error, the cost--
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.200]   This calculation's all over the--
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.600]   Oh, there's the vacancy for that Intel chip.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.160]   Oh, that's right.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   You could add a floating point processor.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.000]   The SX.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.360]   You could add--
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.400]   The funny drama about the--
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.080]   not this one, but the newer ones
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.280]   was that the Intel would have go, do, do, do, do,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.320]   and show the animation of the chip.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   That it was rendered on a Mac.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.760]   Of course it was.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.600]   Well, electric--
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   You know, fool.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.800]   This is the--
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.520]   Well, Intel was so successful they could actually
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.320]   afford Mac spec.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.960]   This is the Intel jingle in the 1970s.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.400]   That quite is exciting.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.600]   They didn't have the money.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.400]   They didn't have the money.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.200]   Do we have an instrument?
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.920]   Don't we have something that turns around here that can just
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.400]   go bump up.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.320]   Let's get a few people in here going bump, bump, bump.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.800]   Our thanks to the Dedham High School senior Corel
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.280]   for our startup noise.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.920]   All right.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.440]   All right.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.720]   I guess we should do some Apple.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.240]   And there really is no Intel in Apple.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.880]   Is there any Intel in Apple at all?
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   I mean, I know we don't have any--
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.680]   Yeah, the CPU.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.280]   The iMac, the 27-inch iMac, and the Mac Pro.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   It's still Intel in--
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.760]   And there's no--
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.680]   Oh, and the Mac in any.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   Intel modem chips in the new Apple Silicon--
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.760]   No, that's all Qualcomm.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.480]   It's all Qualcomm.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.840]   And Apple bought the Intel business.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.880]   Oh, Qualcomm today, actually, they did their big investor
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.520]   day.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.960]   And there was a little bit of rumbling
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.240]   because Qualcomm said in 2023, their profits
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.480]   are going to go down because Apple will no longer be using--
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.880]   they'll only be using 40% of their modems or something.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.040]   No, yeah.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.960]   Using Apple modems by then.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.360]   Yeah, Apple famously tried to use the Intel modems
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.960]   for a while.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.200]   They were so bad.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.920]   And it slowed down the Qualcomm modems
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.160]   so they wouldn't look too fast.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   Yes.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.560]   When the user base is trading stuff on message boards
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.600]   and blogs, here are the serial number prefixes
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.360]   that would indicate that the iPhone you're
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.120]   about to pick up from the Apple store has the Intel modem
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.200]   chip as opposed to the Qualcomm chip.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.040]   That's bad PR.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.320]   We had talked last week about a weird memory leak
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.880]   that people were reporting in Monterey, Mac OS--
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.720]   what is it, 11?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.120]   What is it?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   What is Monterey?
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.000]   13?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   13 now?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.360]   12.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.800]   12 is it 12 point something?
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.440]   So confusing.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.160]   Anyway, 12.0.1.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.000]   12.0.1, yeah.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.640]   Mac OS Monterey, do we call it Mac OS 12 now?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.320]   Just Mac OS.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.520]   Apple frowns on that.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   They just want the Monterey.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.080]   They just-- the numbers are all hidden.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   People don't like numbers.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.360]   It scares them.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   We don't know what it is.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.400]   So the memory leak, according to the eclectic light company,
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.240]   has been discovered.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.760]   You won't believe this.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.080]   And by the way, I had the memory leak, and I was doing this.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.200]   So maybe I actually stopped using Firefox
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.080]   because it was using so much memory on my M1 Pro.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.360]   Started using Safari again.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   The cause has been isolated to a setting
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.000]   in the accessibility preference pane.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.560]   If you change your pointer size, or you use the brand new custom
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.920]   outline and fill colors, there is apparently a pointer--
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.400]   memory leak in the pointer.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.880]   The leak appears to occur when the pointer type changes
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.400]   from, for instance, the standard error to an eye beam
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.800]   for the insertion of text.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.120]   And apparently, the memory used by the previous pointer
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   isn't freed if you're using a custom pointer.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.800]   Every app with an interface in which the pointer can change
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.200]   type will leak until this bug is fixed in Monterey.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.960]   The fix, which I--
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.120]   It's just email and notes that people have been complaining
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.200]   about, and those are very-- those switch for the text
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.440]   insertions.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:49.940]   Yes.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.640]   Anything with a text field, right?
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.560]   The fix is to go into the accessibility settings,
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.600]   click the pointer tab, and turn everything off.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.760]   Set it back to normal, which I did.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.960]   And OK, sadly, because I--
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.280]   What had you changed to, Leo?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.880]   A big pointer.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.960]   Just out of curiosity.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   Oh.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.480]   It's-- you know, I don't really need it because I switched it back
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.360]   and it's fine, but especially on the laptop.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.440]   But I just got used to it.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.880]   And I think it was because on my Big iMac Pro,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.320]   I would lose the pointer regularly.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   I had three screens.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.680]   So the pointer could be here.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.120]   It could be there.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.960]   It could be there.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.600]   Did you shake it?
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.000]   Because it gets huge when you shake it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.640]   I turned on the shake feature.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.560]   But I just thought, you know, I'm going to make the pointer big.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.200]   And in fact, I complained for a while that I couldn't.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.160]   And then somebody said, you idiot, it's in accessibility.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.520]   So I made the pointer big.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.480]   And then I just got used to doing that every time.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.280]   And now I guess I won't.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.200]   Proper could fix it.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.440]   And I absolutely did see this happening.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.160]   It was a Firefox was a particular problem.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.520]   So much so that you might even see that your Mac
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.040]   has run out of application memory error, which I did see
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.480]   on my brand new M1 Pro.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.720]   So anyway, there you go.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.160]   Thank you to the eclectic light company.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.640]   And they seem to have solved that.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.960]   And now it's on Apple to fix it.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.760]   And that's our entire show for the day.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.640]   Because I got nothing, everybody.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.880]   I got nothing, everybody.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.480]   It is the typical very, very slow period
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.280]   between Apple product releases.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.840]   Apple--
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.800]   Well, somebody's got to be mad about something, Leo.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.760]   I mean, this is the internet.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.960]   Well, Apple's probably mad about Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.080]   because she has said to Apple, no.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.600]   Apple and Apple attorneys tried to get an injunctive relief
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.640]   on the judge's order that they add that link into apps
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.920]   that allows you, as let's say Amazon and the Kindle app,
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.160]   to say, just click the link to buy it.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.320]   Go to-- you'll take it as far.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.920]   Too hard it is to say that links are OK,
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.880]   like to take the word no out of a text card.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.480]   Apparently, not difficult it is.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.000]   Here's what Apple is crying out that word.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.600]   Barry said, this will be the first time Apple has ever
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.120]   allowed live links in an app for digital content.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.320]   It's going to take months to figure out
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.400]   the engineering, economic, business, and other issues.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.480]   It's exceedingly complicated.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.680]   There have to be guardrails and guidelines
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.760]   to protect children.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.320]   To protect just two hippies in a garage.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.440]   Please, different types of developers,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.800]   to protect consumers, to protect Apple.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.880]   And they have to be written into guidelines
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.560]   that could be explained and enforced and applied
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.080]   Judge Gonzalez-Rogers said, yeah, no.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.840]   She said she could do it in a cave with scraps.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.280]   The thing that was really interesting about this, though--
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.000]   and I think Apple had to know this going in,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.840]   is that it's very unusual for Judge to overturn her own ruling,
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.120]   like to stay her own decision, because she's the one that made it.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.480]   And the interesting thing is that they got her to confirm
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.520]   that it was links.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.120]   Because there was a lot of-- well, some people
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.640]   were debating whether it was like metal links, links,
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.040]   buttons, other in-app purchases.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.400]   And in this clarification, she very clearly states
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.560]   that it's not for in-app.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.360]   Apple still has complete control or in-app purchases,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.240]   but they have to allow these external links.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.640]   So I wonder if Apple knew they were going to lose this.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.000]   I'll fight that on appeal.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.160]   But they really wanted that language clarified,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.680]   so that people wouldn't be debating it anymore.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.400]   We just put a little jiu-jitsu, in other words.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.560]   You have to make that request--
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.720]   You have to make that request of the judge before you appeal it.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.240]   So they can't just jump to the ninth circuit.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.600]   So that's what they're going to do next.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.120]   And then they'll go to the Supreme Court
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.880]   and see if they get hurt.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   So they're still a couple of jiu-piel.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.040]   They still have to go.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.400]   But they had to do this.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.600]   They needed that they were going to go.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.880]   The judge, first of all, said Apple
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.200]   wanted an open-ended stay with no requirement
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.360]   that it make any effort to comply.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.600]   Apple has provided no credible reason for the court
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.440]   to believe the injunction would cause the professed devastation.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.920]   They also-- she also said, look, they asked--
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.000]   instead, they asked for an indefinite stay
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.520]   instead of just more time.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   And she said--
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   You're terrifyingly up.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.360]   She said, you haven't asked for an additional time.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.040]   You've asked for an injunction, which would effectively
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.200]   take years--
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.960]   I think this is the real reason--
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.480]   all subtlety aside, you asked for it across the board stay,
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   which could take three, four, or five years.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.600]   Apple says, we're confident we're going to win the appeal.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.280]   So let's just wait until the appeal's over before you
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.320]   enforce this.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.960]   And she said, no, we're going to enforce it.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.320]   December 9th, Apple will have to start putting links--
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.280]   they don't have to do it.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.840]   By the way, as you said, Renee, they don't have to do anything.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.320]   It's to stop protecting you if you put them in.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.880]   They just have to take the word no out.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.200]   This is embarrassing.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.080]   This is just embarrassing.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.560]   This is-- this should come into four
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.960]   whenever we're thinking about how they're reacting to complaints
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.680]   but how strong the barrier of we just
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.040]   don't want to do this thing.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.240]   And we feel as though that is sufficient grounds for not
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.080]   doing it.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.600]   Like, no.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   Well, given--
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   It's like--
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.960]   Apple's most-- the chances is that Apple believes no additional
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.640]   business changes should be required until all appeals,
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.400]   in this case, are resolved, which of course--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.440]   Because they're going to lose.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.520]   Because they're going to lose.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.040]   I mean, Apple's going to win.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   And so they don't want to bother to make this move
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.000]   because it's not going to make it through.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.640]   Like, it's a very weak case.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   And so the thing is that it will--
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.040]   the effect that it does have on users
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.480]   is going to be that all these companies are going
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.080]   to want to kind of press down on really forcing us
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.960]   to go somewhere else other than buy it in the App Store.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.840]   Here's the deal.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.880]   One star.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.800]   One star, one star, one star.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.080]   If I see this anywhere, one star, I'm going to tweet it.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.200]   The thing is-- look, I know you guys don't think so,
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.040]   but I got a lot of response from that last time.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.640]   And what people should do is follow me on Twitter, one star.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.720]   Because we're going to-- no, because the thing is
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.840]   is you don't need to have millions of people be upset.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.480]   You need hundreds of people that are really focused.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.120]   And the thing is is that what you can count on
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.080]   if you're a developer is one star if I see this in there.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.120]   I think that the courts can do whatever they want,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.640]   but we as users need to defend our ability
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.120]   to have the environment that we want.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.040]   If you don't agree on that, that's fine.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.840]   But if you do agree on it, follow me on Twitter
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.560]   and we'll organize ourselves.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.640]   May I introduce a new argument that I haven't said before?
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   My reaction to this-- I'm well on record,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.320]   so we're not going to go into that.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.640]   I'm not going to go into that again.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.320]   However, the fact that this could work also
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.360]   indicates another problem with the App Store
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.080]   that Apple needs to fix, which is my problem with one star
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.520]   reviews everywhere is that--
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.880]   I'll use my personal experience with one of my books.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.760]   I had a perfect 80, 90 reviews, all of which
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.600]   were like five stars, or four and a half, or whatever.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.400]   And one person gave me a one star review.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.080]   And well, what was this problem with it?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.960]   Well, I thought it was going to explain
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.360]   how to use my iPhone.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.080]   But it only does what the book title says
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.840]   and what the description says it does.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.400]   And I had to-- I wasn't engaging with them.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.600]   I was trying to talk to them saying--
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.760]   so basically you're saying that this 200 and some page book,
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.960]   if you got in every page, said, hey, George, you're an idiot,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.600]   I just stole $20 from you, it would still
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.680]   had gotten one star because that's
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.520]   the lowest possible rating.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.320]   So when you have activists who, A,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.480]   try to use the rating system to, from one point of view,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.560]   create change that is necessary.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.320]   From another point of view, trying
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.000]   to bully and cajole and abuse the system to harass a creator
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   for doing something they don't like,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.640]   that shouldn't basically tank the entire thing.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.000]   Well, one star review of this app
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.200]   means that this doesn't work.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.880]   It's a rip off of money.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.120]   It steals my data.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.840]   It makes it fun with my dog.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   And well, again--
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.400]   I can't understand why it's a big deal.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.640]   That's what I'm saying that the time I'm saying that I'm a one
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   star review needs to be--
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.840]   All it means is when--
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.360]   When--
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.720]   It's the time completely un-mised understanding this,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.200]   that Amazon can in the Kindle app say,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.640]   if you'd like to buy a book, click this link.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.160]   I know.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   And that takes you to the floor.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   But that's not what it's going to happen.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.520]   This is the beginning.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.440]   This is the beginning.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.320]   I guess where it went.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.520]   George, let's not think.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   Hold on.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   Hold on.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   Hold on.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:12.720]   Hold on.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.200]   I do want to ask you, Alex, why are you so certain that this
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.280]   will be overturned on appeal?
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.880]   Because it's a big overreach to tell someone how
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.040]   to change their business model.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.240]   And while it may make it through appeals, it will not make
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.720]   it through the current Supreme Court.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   It will just get shut down.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.680]   It's not-- no way.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.120]   That's the show.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.240]   The thing is, is that--
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.040]   I don't know what the legal basis is for it.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.800]   We should have a bet.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.280]   Maybe I'll bet you a case of apple cider donuts or something.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.960]   But we won't know for five years.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.560]   And I'd have to be a shuffle.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.320]   Don't buy them now.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.440]   Don't buy them now, Leo.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.000]   I want them to--
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.480]   I want them to--
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:45.480]   I want them to--
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:45.480]   I want them to--
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.480]   I want them to--
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.480]   I like the fresh.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   A whole day.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   Don't buy them now.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   Don't buy them now.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   You're the--
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   You're the--
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.320]   The thing is, is that it'll-- by the time--
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   it wouldn't matter because by the time it got done,
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   Apple would have a different business model.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   I mean, you know, the thing is--
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.720]   Well, that's exactly why they wanted to stay, of course.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.240]   But the issue is, is that we as--
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.960]   when you see something coming in that's a problem,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.800]   it's a lot easier to handle it when it's small.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.040]   And so as users, we have to know--
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.120]   So what's the worst case scenario?
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.880]   What do you think's really going to be terrible about this?
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.760]   Look, I deal with it all the time.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.640]   It's the I want you to log into my account.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.560]   Like, up to Apple TV, I just want
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.920]   you to buy the thing on Apple TV.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.040]   But no, I have to fill out my name and my--
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.360]   I know, I hate that.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.960]   I hate that.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.520]   And that's what they're all going to become.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.920]   But that's what's going to happen now.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.320]   You have to go somewhere else and sign up.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.840]   Hold on.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.600]   Isn't it that way right now?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.840]   So if I want to buy a book on my Kindle app--
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.360]   And it's--
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.720]   I have to know--
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.800]   and Apple won't let you--
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.280]   Amazon--
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.160]   I'm not talking about Kindle.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.000]   I'm talking about Kindle.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.760]   I'm talking about HBO Max or whatever.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.200]   You know, they're already dealing with--
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.440]   we're already dealing with that in the TV store,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.280]   and it'll just get worse.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.840]   So you're saying--
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.520]   And by the way, I think Apple can still offer--
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.200]   I don't think Apple's enjoined from saying,
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.360]   you can click this link or you can buy it here
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.440]   throughout Apple Pay, right?
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.560]   The slippery slope is going to be that people are--
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.720]   as users, we're going to get pushed harder and harder
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.760]   and harder out of the app store.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.960]   And so whether it's--
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.560]   Well, I think Apple doesn't have to know whether it's
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.480]   about where the Apple--
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.160]   pay with Apple button goes and all of that stuff.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.480]   But I'm just saying that--
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.880]   Right now what Amazon does on the Kindle app is just--
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   they're not allowed to say anything.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.520]   You can't buy it a book.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.800]   You can only read a book.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.600]   And then you have to be smart enough to go, oh, yeah,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.480]   I got to buy it on Amazon.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.880]   Which you can do on your iPhone, by the way.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.400]   You can just do it in the Safari.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.520]   Yeah, it's not a big deal.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.360]   So the main deal--
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.480]   Well, this would be nice to be able to have that link
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.600]   so I could do it directly.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.920]   It doesn't affect me at all.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.120]   So the--
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.080]   I don't see--
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:42.920]   I actually don't see it.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.200]   I buy lots of Kindle ones.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.800]   So I have HBO Max.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.600]   You're saying now HBO Max is going to say,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.200]   if you want to buy it, click this link.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.000]   There's going to be-- yeah, it's going to be--
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.080]   it's the beginning of this.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   But any area of this is going to be us as users constantly
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.440]   having to deal with developers doing everything they can
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.240]   to keep us from using the App Store to order this thing.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.800]   And that's how-- mark my words.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   I think that is going to happen.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.560]   This is how--
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.240]   This is going to happen.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.160]   So we as users are going to be affected by it.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.960]   And we paid for this infrastructure, not the developers
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.720]   and not Apple.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   We paid for it.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.520]   So this is not a defense of Apple.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.240]   This is the defense of the users who spent trillions
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.600]   of dollars on this platform having the experience
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.960]   that they paid for.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.320]   So we paid for that experience.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.160]   And we expect that experience that we've
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.960]   invested in over the last decade.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.120]   And I don't care about Apple.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.800]   And I don't care about the developers in this case.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.040]   What I care about is me as a user or we as users having
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.600]   the experience that we expected when we paid it.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.800]   It's like going into a-- into a buying a house.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.520]   And now having them say, well, no, no, we're
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.040]   going to take this door away from you.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.200]   You know, like the thing is is that we want that door.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.640]   There's a lot of us that want that door.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.040]   And if we want to defend it, the time
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.920]   to get rid of the settlers is when they show up.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.840]   So the thing is is that is not when they built in.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.080]   And we'll see how they go for the next 10 years.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.600]   You know, like, you know, the thing is
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.880]   is that the time to stop this is right now.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.920]   And if we as users, if the courts can't defend us,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.480]   if Congress isn't going to defend us,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.520]   we need to defend ourselves.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.160]   And the only tool that we have is one star.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.040]   You know, and so the thing is, is that--
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.600]   and if we had other tools to Andy's point,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.360]   if I had other tools, or if other people allowed this
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.240]   to just sort itself out on the courts,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.680]   we would never do anything like this.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.800]   But the only tool that we have to show that we're upset
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.000]   is one star.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.400]   And we should be, you know, basically making sure
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.840]   that the first developers that land on the beach
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.800]   don't make it to the forest.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.360]   OK.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.440]   Discrete 100%.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.880]   And that's all I'm going to say.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.720]   Yep.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.520]   Let's take a little break.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.920]   We'll have more in just a bit.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   Alex Lindsay, Andy Enaco, Renee Ritchie.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.000]   Yeah, it'd be interesting to see what happens.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.160]   We'll talk in a year.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.520]   Let's give him a year to--
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.680]   I'd say two or three years.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.080]   Two or three years.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.680]   And two or three years, though.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   It's going to be chaos.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.960]   And a lot of people would like it to be chaos,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   like every other platform.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.120]   But we have this nice little platform that will never
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:02.440]   get back.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.920]   You'll never be able to build this again.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.320]   This is not something that gets built again.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.600]   And we have people that want to tear it apart.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.480]   And for users, you just have to know
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.960]   that we won't get to put it back together.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.080]   Company Dumpy is not going to get put back together
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.320]   if we get staring apart.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.360]   And so we need to-- and if we lose it, it's our own fault.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.200]   Like as users, if we don't do what we need to do
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.040]   to make sure that we manage it, then it's our own fault.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.840]   Because we can-- the users definitely
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   have the power to drive the first ones into the ground.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.680]   And that's what we need to do.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.880]   Well, I think it's reasonable if it does give you
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.440]   a terrible experience to give it one star.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.240]   Just by having-- if Amazon puts a link to the Amazon
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.520]   started by a book, I think I might give that a higher rating.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.120]   That's an improvement.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.400]   And then the epic thing will be to save 30% on your V-coins.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:58.720]   Exactly.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.800]   Click this link instead of the item.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.200]   It'll be all this--
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   it'll just be this constant.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:02.680]   Like--
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.040]   [HONKING]
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   Oh, I think they're good nor bad.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.320]   I mean, like that, some people would love--
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.920]   some people-- the thing is, I like the idea of the competition.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.840]   I like the idea that Apple should be forced to compete
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.920]   on convenience, security, privacy, everything in one place.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.640]   I can subscribe, unsubscribe from every account, all in the--
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   there's a compelling argument to be made
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.240]   that they just win it on a merit.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.280]   And then the developers will go through and say--
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.880]   There's two ways for Apple to win this.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.360]   There's two ways to go ahead.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.880]   Go ahead.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.380]   All right.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.400]   No, I know you're super excited.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.520]   I just wanted to add that last point in there.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.200]   They'll go in and they'll say, like, you can save--
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.280]   we'll give you 15% back.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.600]   We'll give you 30% back on this.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   We'll give you this.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.360]   And then if you're willing to save that money
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.040]   and you're willing to create that secondary--
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.400]   you're willing to create an epic account to store all your coins
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.280]   and stuff in the epic account or the Pokemon Go account
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.920]   or the HBO account or all of that,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.840]   there will be people who will choose the savings
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.760]   over the convenience and there'll be people like me
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.600]   because I lose track of my finances so quickly
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.000]   and so always who want to have everything in one place.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.480]   And at least it'll force a little bit of, I think,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.280]   improvement on both sides there.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.760]   And I have to say, it doesn't ruin the Mac, by the way.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.600]   It doesn't ruin Android, so I'm not convinced it's going to ruin--
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.760]   I use this to go on the Mac for convenience.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.160]   Like, I just go there, I press the button,
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   it installs everything from it.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   And people like that.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.080]   We'll continue to do that.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.520]   We'll be able to-- I presume we'll be able to do that.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.480]   I guess that's the question.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.640]   We'll epic say, you can't buy it in any other way,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.560]   but click on this link now.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.920]   I don't think they're allowed not to.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.000]   I think the whole app has to do is allow them--
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.920]   but with the link there.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.080]   But what they'll do is they'll raise prices
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.960]   and then they'll add the 30% on top.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.160]   That's what they want to do.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.280]   And so the thing is that--
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.720]   and the way Apple will most likely handle this
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.880]   is there were two possible ways for Apple
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.080]   to handle this is a new developer status.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.920]   So a special-- like a developer 2 or pro developer
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.040]   or something like that.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.160]   They basically you agreed to not do that.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.840]   You don't have to.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.960]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.080]   But here are special.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.040]   These are the new libraries only are
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.360]   available to the higher level developers.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.520]   There's a whole bunch of things that Apple could do
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.680]   to incentivize the developers that--
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.000]   and also once you become a parasite, which is basically
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.720]   if you do that, Apple doesn't have any reason
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.640]   to give you the time of day.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.720]   So there's a whole lot of Apple could
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.840]   spend all of its resources on supporting the developers
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.880]   in the other one, which will be 90--
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.560]   be clear.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.040]   Like if they Apple created this other one
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.240]   that you agree to this and you pay another $50 a year
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.120]   or whatever to distinguish it, 99%.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.400]   99% would sign up for that other one.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.840]   And there'd be 1% that Apple just doesn't have to pay attention
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.680]   to anymore.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.240]   And then the other way for Apple to handle it
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.920]   is basically Apple Arcade except for everything.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.480]   You know, like that's where that would be the other way
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.240]   for them to sort that out.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.840]   Which would make you know the developers really
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.560]   wish they hadn't done that.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.600]   Just make sure that as we're having this discussion,
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.320]   we factor in the fact that one of the things many things
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.000]   discovered during the Epic lawsuit
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.280]   was that 70% of all app sales are coming from games
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.000]   and in app purchases through games.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.640]   So just make sure that as we're having this discussion,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.880]   we're not talking about the entire app market.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.040]   We're talking-- OK, I'm sorry.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.440]   But the 99% would sign up for, hey,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.240]   I won't take that direct piece.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.480]   99% of developers would do that.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.880]   Probably 99.9%
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.520]   I'm not that I'm not sure.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.080]   It's really--
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.280]   I think I'm wrong, but I'm not going to argue.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.760]   Yeah, we'll find out.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.560]   Predictions.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.280]   OK. Only time we'll tell.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.320]   Our show today brought to you by BlockFi,
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.440]   whether you're a crypto pro or a total beginner.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.720]   I know everybody's kind of got their radar going around Bitcoin.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.240]   Here's a really easy way to earn Bitcoin.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.120]   And no cost to you.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.280]   The Bitcoin rewards credit card from BlockFi.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.240]   Not only is it cool, it's a cool looking Black card,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.680]   unlimited Bitcoin, and every qualifying purchase you make.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.080]   And by the way, it is about as good a credit card
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.360]   as you get it's a Visa signature card.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.480]   So literally, there's no annual fee.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.440]   This costs you nothing.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.920]   There's no foreign transaction fees we used in Mexico because of that.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:12.560]   And every time Lisa bought something, she was doing a little Bitcoin dance.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.600]   Grow your Bitcoin portfolio.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.880]   When you buy your groceries, pay your bills, fill up at the gas station.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.640]   Just make everyday purchases.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.480]   And your BlockFi rewards Visa signature card is the easiest way to get Bitcoin.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.400]   1.5% back in Bitcoin and all qualifying purchases.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.920]   No reward limits.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.000]   Now's the time.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.960]   If you're at all interested in getting a little bit of Bitcoin in your life,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.040]   Bitcoin, of course, I don't want to start selling you on the value of Bitcoin,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.360]   but it did see a fairly hefty return in 2020.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.600]   I think it was 230%.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.440]   The best performing asset of the last decade,
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.480]   according to Yahoo Finance, outperforming the NASDAQ 100 by an order of magnitude.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.680]   And BlockFi is well known because they're a leader in crypto.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.080]   They were named Forbes FinTech 50 list in 2021.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.840]   So it's easy.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.600]   You can trade your Bitcoin for other kinds of cryptocurrencies right there.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.400]   It's the easiest place to buy, sell, and earn crypto.

[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.760]   Additional terms of service at blockfi.com.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.920]   Blockfi is a financial technology company banking services
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.640]   provided by Evolve Bank and Trust member FDIC.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.920]   Blockfi.com/macbreak.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.120]   Apple did get dinged and finally has decided to settle.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.160]   For some time, they ended this practice in 2013.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.200]   They were searching Apple Store employees as they left work,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.320]   but not paying them.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.200]   They said, "Clock out first and then we'll go through your bags."
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.960]   And check your serial number on your iPhone too.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.720]   I think they really.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.280]   So this could take as long as I have an hour, 45 minutes.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.200]   Well, you didn't have to bring your iPhone with you, Leo.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.440]   You could choose to not have a phone with you if you want to skip online.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.200]   Eight years this thing has been in court.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.000]   This is why the court just takes forever.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.200]   But Apple has settled $29.9 million.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.800]   A lot of times in these class action suits, you figure,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.520]   well, I guess they're going to get an Apple gift certificate.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.040]   Gift card?
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.560]   $0.20 or something.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:06.080]   No, they actually-- the suit included 14,683 workers.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.880]   Each of them will get $1,286.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.640]   So good.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.400]   Well, the lawyers say 40% right?
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.360]   Yeah, so maybe they would have gotten more.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.080]   But still, they still get some--
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.800]   And also the win is that this is way on people's radar.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.640]   And maybe Apple will not do this anymore.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.240]   This is--
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.880]   Well, the stop is 2013.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.440]   Ironic.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.280]   This isn't unique to Apple.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.880]   This is just a real standard labor abuse practice.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.800]   And it's embarrassing that Apple did that even back in the early '20 teens.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.360]   And it's only right that these people not just get a handshake and a sorry.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.680]   But here is we're going to return some of the money that you lost
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.880]   because of our anti-labor policies.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.120]   Actually, I take it back.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.320]   The lawsuit was in 2013.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.000]   They stopped doing this in 2015, December 2015.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.360]   So they haven't done that in some time.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.720]   I also think-- and maybe some of this lawsuit came from the fact
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.320]   that employees were kind of--
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:58.660]   Really?
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.400]   You don't trust me?
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.280]   You think I'm just going to be taking stuff out of the store?
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.360]   Well, no.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.240]   It's not-- it really is about--
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.440]   so you stop paying me, but I'm not allowed to leave the workplace.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.000]   That means that if I'm on the clock as an Apple employee,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   it's a California law.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.320]   So that's why they lost.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.960]   Actually, they lose.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.640]   No, I think Apple settled.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.280]   And I think that it's good that this happened.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.320]   And this is why court case--
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.480]   these kinds of suits exist is to press down on things that don't make sense.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   And so I think it totally makes sense to do it.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.400]   I think that Apple's attempt was to affect behavior, which is don't bring so much stuff.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:32.880]   So what's cool?
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.400]   Maybe that was it.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.040]   Yeah, maybe that was it.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.640]   Yeah, no, it is.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.160]   It is.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   It's absolutely why they did that.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.160]   When they do these checks on the way in and out, what they don't want you to do is bring bags.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.960]   They just want you to-- because I had some friends at the time that were talking about it.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.080]   And they said, well, I just don't take anything to the app store.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.280]   I mean, when I go to work, I just have my phone and it's in my pocket
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.320]   and I don't bother with anything else.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.800]   It doesn't take me any time at all.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:58.840]   And so the idea was this kind of a passive aggressive get everybody to just bring less things in
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.200]   so they don't have to think about it.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   But it just didn't work.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.240]   It just didn't work.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.360]   It's a lot of equipment.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.640]   So I understand the reason that you have to check people,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.200]   but you just should pay them on the way out.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.640]   We shouldn't have to provide lockers for employees who keep bringing their clothes to work.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.800]   We got to stop this.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.040]   Apple surprised me with a press release on November 10th, so that--
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.800]   a little less than a week ago-- was a day after Macbreak Weekly.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.240]   They introduced Apple Business Essentials.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.920]   Now, it's not out.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.440]   It's great.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.280]   It's great beta.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.760]   It's not going to be officially available until next year.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.920]   But it's a business plan for--
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.160]   This is much needed.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.660]   Is it?
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.480]   I mean, Apple has been so far behind.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.800]   And Microsoft offers stuff like this, of course.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   100%.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.800]   Absolutely.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   One complete subscription brings together device management, 24/7 support, and cloud storage.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.040]   And you pay-- let me go down to the fees, because it seems fairly reasonable.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:02.360]   If you're already an Apple house, $2.99 per device per month--
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.560]   that includes 50 gigs of iCloud-- $6.99 per user per month gives you three devices
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.320]   and 200 gigs of storage per user-- $12.99 per user per month.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:19.640]   Give your power users a multi-device plan up to three devices and two terabytes per user
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   of storage.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.600]   Totally makes sense.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   Totally makes sense.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.680]   And I don't think it really affects companies like Jamf as much, because Jamf has a lot more
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   value add.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.000]   They're the ones that-- they're kind of the market leader in managing this for you from
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.200]   Apple's-- if you have an Apple platform.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.520]   Yeah, that was my concern is that Jamf-- this would really harm Jamf.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.520]   You don't think so.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.440]   No, it does take-- yeah, I think that they-- the issue is that we used to do this all
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   the time when we were doing Hangouts was that we loved training new people on Hangouts,
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.920]   because they would start doing show-- doing their own little events and same thing with
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   Zoom.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.860]   They start doing their own little events, and they get really-- then they start getting
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.120]   really good at it, and then they immediately hit the glass ceiling.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.160]   And then they go, hey, can you help us make something more complicated?
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.400]   And that's what we wanted to live in.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:07.280]   So in the same way, I think the Jamf is in a situation where they-- this is going to
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.720]   create a lot more people thinking about managing their fleet in a way that they haven't in
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.760]   the past, and then they're going to hit a wall.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.000]   This is a great-- for small businesses and for people getting started and everything
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.640]   else, this is a really, really great solution.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.240]   And it's going to get a lot of people who weren't doing it to think about the next step
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   after they get to that.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.360]   And I think that's where it really sets Jamf up for success.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   I bet you Jamf will do better in this environment.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.800]   You're exactly right, because that's what Jamf CEO Dean Hager said.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.880]   We welcome the opportunity.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.000]   We believe this expected announcement is good news and prevents Jamf with a terrific opportunity.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It just--
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.880]   We compare and contrast that to Intel's response to Apple entering the Silicon market just to
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.920]   see how comfortable each of those EOs feel they're--
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.880]   That little life-- you mean that little lifestyle company in Cupertino?
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   You mean that one?
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.040]   I mean, if you're-- and I'm a small business, so I understand a lot of small and medium-sized
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.640]   businesses don't have IT departments.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.680]   They outsource their IT to manage service providers and the like.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.920]   And I think getting it from the company, whether it's Microsoft with its business offerings
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.040]   or Google for some, I think-- I don't know what we do.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:26.040]   I think Russell just does it all on his own or from Apple makes a lot of sense.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.400]   It all together.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   I think that--
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.400]   Go ahead.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.320]   I'm just saying that it's amazing that after so many years, there are always going to be
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.120]   these little gaps that any company has been aware of but has yet to fill in serving their
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.280]   customers.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.680]   And at some point, either the pain point of knowing how much money they're leaving on
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:56.000]   the table by not helping and assisting these types of users or the pain of actually introducing
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.040]   these features gets so low.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.440]   That's when you start to do things that are come down to the line of, wow, why didn't
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.160]   they do this before?
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.240]   But these things that have become-- these features that have become table stakes for
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.560]   teams, it's-- I'm glad that Apple is now making sure that they can support that directly
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.720]   rather than saying, well, good luck with that.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.960]   Is this a change in strategy from Apple?
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.480]   They've kind of ignored business, right?
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.120]   They've always thought education was important, creatives and professionals were important,
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   but they've let other people run it.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.400]   They've just let other people manage that, whether it's Salesforce or Jamf or other folks
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.880]   that put your stuff on it and they kind of stay out of the way.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:38.680]   It's just that that kind of lower cost easy turnkey solution doesn't really exist.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.400]   And so I think that that's where I think that they're kind of putting it.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.600]   I don't think they're going to try to do what Jamf does.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.800]   I think they're going to try to make it just easy for people who need that.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.640]   What I'm really interested to see is whether they go deeper into education.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.200]   Education's going to be a big opportunity next year.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.600]   And Apple, when things get disrupted and education's going through a huge disruption
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.040]   and will be much worse next year, usually creates opportunity to move the market around
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.160]   a little bit.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   And Apple's key weakness is fleet management within schools.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.680]   And so hopefully they'll take what they're doing here and expand.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.760]   So explain to me.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:20.360]   So I understand iCloud, but what is the-- but the most important part of this is not that.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.960]   It's the management.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.760]   It's MDM--
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   Right.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   Mobile device management.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:33.400]   Is it-- will Apple offer, do you think Renee's special software to do this?
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   Jamf does, right?
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400]   Jamf gives you a console.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.440]   I think what Apple's looking at-- and they've been building towards the soil.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.200]   They've been making purchases and they've been expanding what their enterprise team
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.320]   does over the last couple of years.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.520]   And I think what they see as their current sweet spot is the small business, which is
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.440]   way under Jamf's radar, way under Salesforce's radar.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.840]   And I don't want to use a term prosumer because I think that's really used for something
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   else.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.640]   But it really is sort of like really consumer friendly business things.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.680]   So one of the things Apple does, for example, is that they ensure that what is on your device
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.840]   is on your device and the business can't touch that.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.120]   They have control over the business stuff, but it basically firewalls that out.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.040]   Your apps or your apps, your data is your data.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.600]   Whoever-- if you bought your own device, the company doesn't get to just take it over
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.520]   and make it a business device, which some of that software does in some situations.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.360]   But who paid for it basically gets the final say and who gets to control it.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.920]   So there's a lot of really interesting innovative things there, which not all businesses may
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.120]   like, but which I think people who are forced-- or not forced, but the situation where they
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.920]   are the ones buying it actually maintain ownership of it.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.960]   I think it's really interesting and something that I hope propagates throughout that business.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:43.760]   So you have a fleet of employees with iPhones, iPads, Macintosh, computers.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.680]   It lets you keep track of them in Vintarium on board.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:53.040]   Yeah, deploy apps across the apps, provision them, all of that stuff in a centralized way.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   That's the main use for this.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.400]   Yeah, maintain control over the data, delete them, recover them all the-- everything you
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.240]   need to do if you're running a business with a non-trivial amount of employees.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.240]   Right.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.720]   It's actually surprising Apple hasn't done this.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.160]   Yeah, particularly with the iPhone, I mean security and privacy, it's not a trivial problem
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.840]   by any means to allow someone to have a business personality and a personal personality on
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.240]   theirs on that same personal device.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.800]   But it really is the sort of thing that's going to have to crack because there are still
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.440]   some installations where it's like, we're going to have to issue you a second phone because
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:31.840]   we can't-- there's no way we can maintain, configure, and arm your phone to do the sort
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.880]   of business that we need a mobile app to do.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.720]   So I'm sorry, you're going to have to keep two phones charged at all times.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.240]   And I'm going to address on the Android platform, it's still not perfect speaking to how difficult
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.400]   the problem is, but at least they're making strides to giving built-in, standardized,
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.880]   recognizable solutions rather than hoping that third-party solutions are safe, secure,
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   and appropriate.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.440]   Yeah, Apple's always provided the back end like MDM.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:04.240]   But this is-- here's a picture of the front end, which is a very Apple in its interface.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:10.280]   You can see that different groups have different apps, different users, different devices.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.400]   You have a service and support tab.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.960]   Looks pretty good, I guess.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:20.040]   I'm not an IT guy, but I could see how you would need this.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.480]   And I hope it doesn't step on JAMPS toes too much.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   Salesforce, fine.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.840]   But I'm going to add a soft spot for JAMPS.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.720]   JAMPS was like behind Apple in the early days when no one else was--
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.600]   Yeah, I can't see this.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.160]   This is different from Sherlocking, where you're saying, oh, why-- you've got this-- this third
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:42.240]   party has developed what has become a beloved and useful and responsive standard.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.320]   Why do you want to crush them by integrating this into the OS and giving them something
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   substandard?
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.120]   But then there's the-- but this isn't like a calculator.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.760]   This is-- here is core functionality that can make the whole platform better.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   Do you think they'll bring back X-serve now?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   Is that the next step?
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   I wish.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   I know.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760]   I want the server.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.240]   I want the heart.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.000]   I want the screeching, screeching server that can actually have an MA office and running
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   like files.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.080]   No, seriously, Apple Silicon would be great on a server.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.920]   I know people are salivating for it, Leo, but all you're getting is some side mounting
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.000]   rails in your Mac Pro, and you're going to be happy you got those.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   I guess so.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   OK.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Make a rackable app.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.640]   You don't have to call it an X-serve.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   Just make it rackable.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   They already have that.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   It's called on Mac Mini.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   You get two of them in rack.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.800]   Yeah, you can put two in a rack.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   Right?
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   Is the Mini one you-- hi.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Well, hi is it.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.800]   Right?
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   And then you can get--
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.800]   It's half a new one.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.920]   There's a variety of boxes like Sonnet makes a box that you can put a card into that is
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.120]   then the Mini, so it really turns it into a server at that point.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   Perfect.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.000]   And so you can do that, too.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.520]   Emoryk in the chat, I'm saying Jamf doesn't give support to users directly.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.880]   I presume Apple business essentials wouldn't either.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.800]   It's really for the managed service provider, not for the end user.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   So this isn't any new offering for end users, Apple End users, just to be clear.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:07.920]   All right, so there is a battle suddenly raging about Apple's ads.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   Suddenly.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   Suddenly.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.920]   Suddenly.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.920]   It's like it just happened last week.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.680]   Well, they've been doing it for years, it turns out.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.680]   Five years.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.680]   Five years.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:25.480]   But it became public with an article in Forbes, Apple quietly buying ads via Google for high-value
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:33.640]   subscription apps to capture app publisher revenue after the accusation Apple responded,
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:41.120]   yes, we run ads for third-party apps, but we also are in communications with the developers
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   about that.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.400]   Apple told 9 to 5 Mac, it has been placing those ads for third-party applications for
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.800]   over five years.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.960]   The ads, and you see this in the app store.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.040]   We've all seen them.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.360]   The ads are designed to simply promote the products distributed via the app store.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.360]   Well, not just the app store.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.560]   This is the Google thing.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.240]   This is buying Google's web search ads.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.320]   This is what they're buying.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   That's right.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.360]   Along with Walmart buying something about something they're trying to sell you or target buying
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   some Apple.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.480]   Yeah, Apple says, in fact, it's just like retailers running advertisements for the products they
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   sell.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.480]   We all win.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.960]   Also, it's not as though.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.520]   We decided not to go with a tiny little market share of the ad digital ad market in Google.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.160]   We decided to go with, no, of course you're going to do business with Google.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.880]   They're successful in part because they are successful at delivering the product that
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.680]   people who want to advertise things want to have.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:37.480]   Apple, so this is not secret or quiet, according to the words used by Forbes.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.760]   They're buying Facebook ads.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.800]   The company says it regularly communicates with developers about the ads.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.560]   They're clearly labeled as being from the app store.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.440]   They are permitted under the standard Apple developer program agreement.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:53.960]   They say they're running advertisements promoting more than 103rd party applications on networks
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:58.520]   like Google, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, and Twitter.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   We've seen the ads.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.080]   I mean, we've all seen the ads.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.160]   This is a poorly researched, poorly written article.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.640]   It just continues Forbes slow slide into the mud.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.120]   I think that's fairly accurate.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:14.280]   I mean, there's so many articles they put out that are just so poorly written and so poorly
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   back.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.840]   Sometimes they actually feel like hit pieces.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.840]   Yes.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.160]   They're trying to get their name to it, which is separate.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.880]   There's Forbes, which still pays people.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.080]   They have Forbes contributor network, which anybody can write anything on, medium with
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:33.200]   no rules, and then use the Forbes name, which I think is terrible for the brand.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.040]   There is some good content being done with Forbes contributor network.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:41.800]   The first, whenever I see a news item under that saying, this is according to Forbes,
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.960]   question one is this actually Forbes?
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.520]   Or is this contributor network?
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.080]   It's like, okay, I don't need to read this.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.440]   This is probably not going to be relevant.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.800]   This is a guy who is not on staff at Forbes.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.640]   John Kett's here.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:49:00.040]   Now, his title is senior contributor, but then if you hover over it, it says opinions
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.720]   expressed by Forbes contributors of their own.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.960]   His title is way more exciting than what you just explained, though, Leo.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.160]   This article is way more gotcha than the explanations.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.320]   I'm just going to read the article.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.560]   Right.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.640]   Which is why it spreads like wildfire.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   Yes.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.920]   I mean, with both Forbes and Bloomberg, I kind of look at it sideways and like, okay, we'll
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.720]   see what they have to say, but I'm going to see it like six other places before I believe
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.680]   anything that comes out of either one of those sources.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:37.040]   It's probably a light week.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.840]   It's not a lot of great stuff.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.120]   Let's talk about death.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.360]   That was a really cool announcement last week.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   Death.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   They announced death.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.200]   Well, there's Apple announced that they're going to be supporting death in the upcoming
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.360]   release of iOS.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   You can finally--
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:01.320]   You can finally designate-- and the current beta for iOS is going to be rolling out to
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.360]   iOS and Mac in the near future.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.240]   You can currently designate a legacy contact so that after you die, there will just simply
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.560]   be a simple procedure for your loved ones to get access to your iCloud content and
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   that kind of stuff.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.320]   Whereas it used to be a very, very-- the terms of service of iCloud used to essentially
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.200]   say that, look, when you die, all of your data dies with you.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:26.760]   Don't think that this is just going to be like your photos are in a drawer and your
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.640]   kids can just go and grab them.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.880]   So they're long-related.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   It's been a very, very painful process for people who have to go through what is not an
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:41.440]   established policy, not an established procedure to say, I'm proving to you that I am this
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.640]   person's son.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.280]   I am proving to you this person is no longer deceased.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:51.600]   I am proving to you that it's OK for you to release my father's eye photo gallery to
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:56.040]   me so that I can actually get access to all of this stuff, get access to the context,
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.680]   get access to stuff that I need to close out to deal with the financial repercussions
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.960]   of this estate.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.760]   So now this is basically here is what you need to do.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:09.640]   So long as that user was able to express to Apple that this-- I am explicitly OK with
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:17.320]   my son accessing my stuff after I die, then that's it'll be a much, much simpler procedure.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.200]   Other services do a better job, I think.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.400]   Google has a feature where you can be very, very fine-grained about it and you can even
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.560]   say, I don't care if it is my son.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.760]   You nuke everything.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:32.480]   I don't want anybody to see where I was traveling, when I was photographing, what I was into.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.760]   But again, it's an important thing and I'm glad that Apple is finally getting around
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.120]   to it.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:45.640]   So if you want to know more, I guess I should do this digital-legacy.apple.com and you can
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:51.080]   do it both, I guess without a key, but I think if you're still alive, for those of you still
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.400]   alive and after the last conversation, maybe I understand a few of you are, but for those
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   of you still with us, you can get your legacy contact access key and share it with your
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.040]   legacy contacts and then they'll have an easier time.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:14.640]   I think this is, it's interesting to watch as the baby boomers age, everybody's starting
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.880]   to think about this.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.520]   Facebook has a way to do this.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.960]   A lot of social networks do.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.640]   I mean, when my father died, part of what made it easy was the fact that he was getting
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.960]   his email service through me.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.960]   Right.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.400]   And this was 10 years ago before we put a lot more stuff on the internet.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.840]   I don't know how difficult it would have been to try to contact a nice piece, say, "Hi,
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.240]   please allow me to get access to my dad's inbox because I need those digital records
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:48.640]   of financial transactions and accounts that he actually had."
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:56.320]   Actually, most password managers now, I know our sponsor, Bitwarden, does our former sponsor
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.600]   LastPass does have an emergency access that's kind of the same idea.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:06.680]   But I think even if I gave Lisa emergency access to my iCloud account, would that be
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.920]   as good as this?
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.440]   Should she just log in and pretend she's me?
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.160]   This is still in beta.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.840]   So I think the main thing is you don't want to necessarily let people just log in as
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   you want to get the access.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   Well, there's no dead man's access.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.840]   There's a dead man's wish.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:26.280]   So when you say that, they have to send an email requesting your Bitwarden password.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.960]   Bitwarden sends you an email.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.280]   You said how long it is before they give up.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.960]   So if you said, "I'm not dead yet."
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.400]   No, then they go, "Okay, never mind."
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   Flash.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   Flash.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400]   Flash.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:46.280]   I should also say that number one, you definitely, no matter how much money you make or how
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.800]   valuable you think that your estate is, you should definitely find the money to hire an
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.960]   actual lawyer to have an actual will drawn up.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   It will save.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   Oh, that's for sure.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   That's about a trouble.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:03.240]   But part of this is you can actually explicitly, if your lawyer is hip enough, I mean, employable,
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:08.520]   they will actually be able to put in a section saying, "I'm going to designate this person,
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.840]   a certain person as the holder of my digital legacy so that if they do have problems talking
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.080]   to iCloud, talking to Google, talking to Facebook, talking to whoever, they say, "Well,
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:23.920]   no, here's this document that Andy actually signed says that he is okay with me seeing
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.240]   my, his cloud stuff after he dies."
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.520]   And also the rights, if you're writing stuff, if you're creating software, who gets the
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:36.160]   rights to your software, all that kind of stuff is the stuff that it's, you hate to spend
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.200]   like five or six hundred dollars or even a thousand dollars to a lawyer for a document
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.680]   that you sign when there is like an Xbox.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   I'm serious.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.160]   For me, I also have to talk myself into doing these smart things when, but didn't just last
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.360]   week we decided that we're not going to buy a VR headset because it would be a waste of
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   money.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   Now we're giving someone a thousand dollars and we're not getting anything back.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.720]   No matter how much, how much might hurt at that moment when you write that check or you
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.920]   make that payment, it will solve so many problems for the people that you're leaving
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   behind that.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   And you speak somebody with cheap money.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.560]   So it's, it's good to remind people.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:13.160]   I don't, we close down two parents estates and it's like, thank goodness that my dad was
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:17.800]   on the ball because even though even the few places where there were gaps, it was like,
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:23.360]   I'm in no mood and no frame of mind to have to deal with a phone tree that is not designed,
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.720]   that is designed to make it easy for me to sign up for something almost impossible for
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.880]   me to cancel something.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   So yeah.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.800]   So I'm not sure how complete this support is yet because when I go to digital dash legacy
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.880]   dot apple.com it says, you know, learn more.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.320]   I click learn more and all I get is the apples generic.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   It's still in beta.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   It's still in beta.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.480]   I've rather developed it's in the developer builds.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.360]   I think, so I think that that's only there for the people who have the beta.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.160]   Well, I think that I think that you configure this through preferences through settings
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.320]   pain on the iPhone right now.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.080]   I think in the future you should be able to go to iCloud.com and designate if they're
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.920]   the way that you should be able to run a year on the latest betas.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.480]   Is it in there?
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.720]   Is it on your phone?
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.040]   I don't think so.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.560]   You have noticed you have no, no errors.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.120]   So it doesn't matter for you.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.560]   It's all just going to go away.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.560]   Poof.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.560]   I'm sure it is there.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   No, you don't often does it.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.840]   I'll have to designate either Andy or Alex or something.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   Dibs.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.280]   But you don't get my iTunes collection.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   That's a really important part.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   That's the only important part.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   You don't have to have that.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.520]   So yeah, none of the media can be handed down.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.840]   But my photo, not like physical media, honestly more valuable than money I think maybe to your
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   ears might be.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.840]   Well, that's not true.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.000]   But, but almost as the money goes the money.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   They can buy photos.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   You would hope.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Might be the photos.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.520]   You know, because those are family treasures.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:50.120]   That's, you know, and thanks to digital photography these days, we all have lots of pictures that
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   we should.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.240]   I have 170,000 screenshots clogging my iTunes storage.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:54.500]   I can't wait to hand those down to my
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:57:00.700]   My kids, my kids, I think my kids would be like, do you mean we have to start off, start
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.240]   over at TikTok all over again?
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   Oh, no.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.480]   Well, it's trained it so well.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.840]   As it happens, like I was, I was, I'm doing like, I'm trying to do my deep, deep, deep,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.120]   office cleaning where there's no no clarinet granny box or drawer that doesn't get emptied
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   out and investigated.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:23.200]   I found a flash drive from like 2006 and I happened to have dumped like a card worth
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.480]   of photos off of my camera onto this.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.280]   And even, and I can see that there were two, the two photos that at the time I was interested
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.280]   in.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.960]   But now I'm glad that I have all the wasted photos of like my dad playing with his grandchildren
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.600]   that, oh, well, oh, well, she's not facing the camera.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   Oh, well, G.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   Well, that's no story there.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:43.760]   No, now it's like, oh, isn't that like, you, I didn't notice how, how my dad was looking
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.280]   at like his grandchildren, even though the grandkid is like moving in blurry.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.560]   And so that's, that's why it's, it's, if you, if you just, if you deliberately do not want
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.160]   your camera role to be shared with people after you died, that's your prerogative.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:00.240]   But don't overlook the idea that even just when you're testing, when you're testing out
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.200]   your new camera and you just took a random unframed photo of what your office looks like,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:10.840]   you have no idea how your grandchildren and your relatives who haven't met you yet are
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.360]   going to treasure that just by saying, wow, he, I don't, I don't know why he liked that
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.960]   painting, but apparently he liked it enough that he wanted in his office.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:25.320]   So the chat room is telling me that it is in system preferences, you click the, your
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:29.480]   name at the top, the Apple ID and it's under password and security.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.000]   And then under account recovery, I don't see it under mine.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.960]   I see a bunch of ways to do account recovery, but I don't see anything specifically for
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.080]   so I want you to be forgotten Leo, apparently at some point, I take it personally, if it's
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.640]   set up, you will have, you will actually print out a piece of paper that you will give to
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.520]   your, your heirs and they can use that to recover your.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:53.000]   Can you, can you assign somebody from the old British TV show coupling to go through
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.440]   and make every photo appropriate before your kids have to see it?
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.320]   So these guys must all be, Micah, you're, you're on the, you must be on the beta because I
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.800]   don't see it on my current search for legacy in your settings.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.800]   And if it's, if it's there, you'll do that right now.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   Still beta.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   Okay.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   They're confirming that.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.160]   So coming soon to a device near you.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.480]   And then apparently if you use family sharing, you'll be able to choose a family member from
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.800]   the list, which will make it easy.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.240]   You want, you want to hear something hysterically funny?
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:27.080]   I didn't know about this until I was talking about this last week on NPR and I was preparing
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.720]   the story, Facebook, like Google, they all, they also have a legacy sort of program.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.200]   It's kind of like that.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.360]   And part of the feature is that once you've been declared dead, your, your, your page
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.800]   becomes sort of a memorial page where you know, no new content, but your friends who
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:45.200]   had access to your photos and stuff can still see your photos and they can actually leave
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.640]   like a book of a member sort of stuff.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   But the, and that, and that's very nice.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.280]   I'm saying something nice about Facebook before getting into the friendly language.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.280]   And don't worry.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.280]   Don't worry.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.200]   We also have ways of figuring out that you're dead.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.600]   And if we, if we figured out that you're dead, we'll do that.
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   A free automatically.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.360]   Facebook knows if you're dead.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   Believe me.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.320]   He hasn't bought a mattress in years.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.600]   They know they know they have patents for how to monetize people after they died.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.760]   It really is quite brilliant.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.760]   I'm sure they do.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.720]   I'm sure they do.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.840]   There's also websites, you know, to help with this from an earlier age.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:23.160]   This is, you know, as, as more and more of us age and kick the bucket, this is going
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.440]   to become more and more of an issue.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.000]   I think I'm glad Andy you've already been there.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.120]   It's good to get your reinforcement.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.160]   My mom and dad are still alive, but, but hanging by a thread.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.360]   So I better get to get over to them.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.000]   Actually, I went over my dad's the other day and he's basically turned his office into
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.640]   a museum of, I mean, it's actually wonderful.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.360]   It's all his history is up there.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.440]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.800]   He's very, you know, he's very self aware.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.800]   He's 88.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   He knows.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.280]   Actually, he said, I just, they're, they're, they're, they're nibbling away at me.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.960]   I wish it was just, just take me.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.920]   You know, this ailment, one element after another.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.760]   You'd rather be, you'd rather be killed majestically by a dragon than nibbled to death by ducks.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760]   Precisely.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.440]   That's a little more, but I'm sorry.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440]   We'll move on.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.480]   I'm sorry, but no, no, no, no, you get it.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.880]   We're, we're, we're uncomfortable.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   So we joke.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.880]   Yes.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880]   There is some truth there.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.320]   No, there's absolutely, you know, and as I get older, I think about this a lot more too.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.880]   People is sticking taxpayers with part of the bill.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.880]   Seems a little bit.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   This is from CNBC.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.960]   This language seems a little slanted sticking taxpayers with part of the bill for rollout
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.120]   of tech giants digital ID card.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.160]   So only a few states have adopted this digital ID card.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.760]   Apple says to the state, if you're going to do it, maybe this is why only a few states
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.320]   have done it, you have to provide customer support.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.200]   Well, duh, you maintain the systems needed to issue and service credentials.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.080]   You need to hire project managers to respond to Apple inquiries.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.480]   You need to prominently market the new feature and push for it.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.120]   It's adoption with other government agencies.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.480]   This is in the contract signed by the four states so far that have gone along with the
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.640]   Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky and Oklahoma.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.760]   I think it would be great.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.400]   I mean, I love it if California would let me have my driver's license in here.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.280]   I already have in my wallet, my vaccination card.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280]   And I think that's great.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:23.880]   But still, it's obnoxious that this is a feature that actually helps people, that helps people
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.240]   to choose to buy iPhones or continue to buy iPhones instead of our competitors who aren't
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.720]   supporting this quite so well or doing all the government stuff that's necessary to make
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.720]   this work.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.640]   But we want you to help us sell all iPhones without this is stuff that Apple should be
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.800]   paying for that the marketing should be theirs.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   Some of the support should be there.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   It's not ours.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:50.360]   The idea that selling it not just to one agency but to all other agencies, that's on them.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.600]   The idea that they want such a...
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.120]   Apple also gets to review it and thinks it's...
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.680]   I want to prove the marketing that states are required.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   Yeah, that's to do.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   That's baloney.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   That's...
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.320]   I mean, you know, Apple said this is...
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.520]   These are the terms and we'll do it and they said yes.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.520]   Yes.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.520]   So I think that that's...
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.000]   I think the thing is that...
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.680]   And the problem is it's going to get really easy and people will look at the other states
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.080]   that don't have it as kind of backwards, which they are.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.520]   And so the thing is that...
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520]   But Apple said this is...
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.640]   And I'm sure that Apple is spending...
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   As one of the first states, while you're not getting Apple money or whatever, Apple did
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   promote it.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.360]   They're talking about it on their keynotes and they will continue to do that.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.600]   That is money that the states aren't spending on that process.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.920]   Number two is that Apple is probably spending an enormous amount of effort on making it
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   work from the back end.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.440]   So they're saying what this is really...
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.920]   This is a one-sided article.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   They're not...
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.080]   Because Apple, they don't know what the other side is.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:45.380]   But I guarantee that Apple is putting heavy engineering into making sure that it actually
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.380]   works and spending...
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.480]   You know, this is just making sure that the state doesn't...
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   What happens if you don't have the...
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   If you don't have the requirements...
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   I would...
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   But a partner...
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.680]   This is not the way this should be done.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.920]   It shouldn't be done with a private industry.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.480]   It should be an open standard that all the states agree to and adopt.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.960]   And then leave that up to Apple or Google to adopt it themselves.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.120]   But this is the wrong direction to come from...
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120]   These are state...
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.600]   These are government state IDs.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.080]   This should be done by the states.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.080]   This should not be done by the...
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   Where would that happen?
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.080]   Where would that happen?
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.080]   If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.160]   But this is exactly the problem right now.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.640]   Silicon Valley stepping up saying, "Hey, we'll take it from here.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   Government, go away.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   We'll handle it."
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.240]   And that's exactly what's wrong with big tech right now.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.720]   And I don't think this is a good trend.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720]   Okay.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.760]   Well, I just don't think it would ever happen if they didn't go down this path.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.280]   You know, government is largely not very good at acting quickly at things.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.280]   And it's fine.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.680]   It does things that are very useful.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.040]   I'm not saying the government's not...
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.040]   There's a lot of use to government.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.040]   Stoney has a digital ID system.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   It's actually...
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   There have been some problems.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040]   Sure, but it's a tiny little country.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.040]   It's tiny little country.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   Well, it's not the same.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.280]   Yeah, we have 50 tiny little countries.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   That's our problem.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.080]   I think it's good.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.080]   I love it.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.840]   I love the fact that you can...
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.040]   Even though I can't really leave California and my wife loves California.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.040]   I can't really leave California.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   I know that I could.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.720]   I think that's a stabilizing thing.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.880]   Texas, I know that I've changed to be here.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.560]   I could go to Nevada or I could go to Oregon or I could go to Pennsylvania.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.720]   And I could do that.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.080]   Even though I won't, I know that I always know that it's federal.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   There is a federal...
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080]   There is a federal...
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.080]   Real ID.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.440]   And I think it would be just a small step to make that digital compatible.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.560]   The real reason it's not happened is because there is a political, strong political move
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.960]   against national IDs.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   Right.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   Right.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   No, no.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.800]   I mean, the government's definitely want you to be in digital ideas.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.680]   It makes it much easier for them.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.680]   Right.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.880]   Which scares you more?
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.680]   A digital ID created by Big Tech or digital ID created by government?
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.920]   They both seem big tech.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920]   Big tech.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   I would.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   I would.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920]   I would.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920]   Ideas.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   One from column A, one from column A.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.280]   Anyway, it's obviously up to the states where they want to do it.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.800]   And I think there is an advantage, although, you know, I wonder how many people would say
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   I'm not...
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.640]   I'm not going to wear a mask or get a vaccine.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.360]   I'm definitely not going to have a state ID.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.080]   I apologize for the ignorant about this, but is this complicated by America where you
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.120]   have like every state works differently?
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.080]   Because other places have to be a federal.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   That's why Estonia can do it.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   Here's your new ID.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.640]   That's why Estonia can do it because they don't have the political communication.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.640]   There's only...
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   You guys can do all these ports.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.640]   Can't you do like...
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.840]   Well, that's on a federal level.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   So things are getting a little bit more complicated.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.520]   You're also not required to have a passport.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.360]   Unless you have a institute.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.360]   Right.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.120]   And also the only nationalization is that now there are new standards for...
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.200]   I'm going to have to renew my ID soon.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.720]   And it's not going to be show up or just fill out a form.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.360]   It's going to be I'm going to have to show up.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   I'm going to have my birth certificate.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.280]   I'm going to give a blood test.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.360]   It's because of the new TSA.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.560]   Thank you very much for requirements.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.000]   I think that's mostly where these new parts are.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   I don't know how it is.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   You want to make sure you don't change things.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.120]   You do not have to get a real ID.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.560]   You could say, "I don't want the real ID, federal ID.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.800]   I want a regular..."
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   You can never fly.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.320]   Everything I want to regularize.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320]   Right.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   I'm just licensed.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.160]   I'm hoping to lead a life in the future where I don't have to fly.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:19.520]   I realize that one of the things that I've lost from COVID is I've lost that skin of
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.680]   desensitization about how horrifying airline travel is.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.160]   But when I do have to fly, I don't want to have to say, "Oh, well, I'm just going to
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.560]   take me three weeks to go get my birth certificate and do this."
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.200]   I was like, "Oh, man."
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.160]   I just have to figure out how to deal with my hair.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.920]   Now I've got to deal with paperwork as well.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.800]   I have to admit that the spell for me for travel is broken.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800]   I have 100%.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   Zero interest.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.160]   I'm like, "I go..."
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.360]   I'm like, "How old food is this?
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.360]   Eight minutes away?"
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.960]   I'm going to find what day I'm going to go.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   I live for 30 bucks.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   No, I...
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   They always deliver the wrong things.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.960]   I'm forcing to deliver the wrong things.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   I'm forcing to deliver the wrong things.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   I'm forcing myself to do that.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.960]   I'm trying to...
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.960]   I'm making myself drown.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   I'm interested.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.080]   I haven't gone back to movies yet either.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.080]   I've become a bubble person.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.840]   At least it's just like shocking.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.480]   She said, "We should all go to a movie on Thanksgiving."
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   I said, "What?"
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.480]   I know, right?
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.480]   What?
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   We watched James Bond in the living room.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.880]   We watched Dune in the living room.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.200]   You want to go to a movie theater?
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.880]   Are you insane woman?
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880]   I was like, "I'm such a..."
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   It's such a...
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880]   Like a month to get it.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   I'm not gonna be a
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.080]   fast comic con of the year because I thought...
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.400]   I know that it's gonna take me until the morning of to decide if I'm comfortable with attending
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.600]   a comic con that doesn't...
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.280]   Has a mask mandate but no vaccine mandate.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.880]   The morning of...
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880]   My bag was all packed.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.320]   I had my camera ready.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.360]   I had my little outfit set up.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.760]   And at the morning I'd said, "I'm just not feeling it.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   I'd much rather make a clean swoop at 2021."
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.600]   I'm glad that I supported the con by giving the money.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.280]   I'm absolutely sincere when I say that.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.000]   I'm glad they at least got my money if they didn't get my presents.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.520]   But I'm at a point where it is enough to try to figure out, "Do I really, really want
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.680]   to go all the way to Boston?
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.800]   The city I love that's only 45 minutes away when I can just go to the library that's nearby."
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.840]   Like, "Okay, Andy, that's unhealthy.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.560]   We are definitely going to the city in three days to have a good time."
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.000]   I bought this in the last three movies and I didn't go.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.320]   I want to support some of them.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.280]   I want to take us to Shang-Chi to James Bond and to it.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:23.280]   Because we're not getting them.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.280]   Canada is not getting them day and day and day.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   So you just bought tickets out of the tickets?
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.280]   No, I bought tickets.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.080]   Because you feel so bad now.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080]   Well, no, I wanted to support it.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.480]   Well, also, like, Shang-Chi was the first really Asian-led cast to Marvel and I thought
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.000]   it was important for them to have a good opening day.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.800]   And the same thing, I just had to remember.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.080]   I was just, I feel bad about the theaters.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080]   God, truthfully.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.640]   Yeah, no, so I want to support them.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.680]   But I just couldn't get out that door.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.480]   It was like, it was like a force field there.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.280]   Oh, you were planning to go.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.600]   You didn't just buy it.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.680]   I thought about it.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   I thought about it.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680]   Well, Shang-Chi, no way.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.280]   I was not going to go to Montreal Theatre back when Shang-Chi came out.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.760]   When "Eternals" and James Bond came out, I was considering it.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.920]   But it's also like 30 bucks.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.880]   I went to look and the prices have gone up.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.080]   If you go to the nice seats in Montreal, it's like 25 bucks a ticket.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.080]   I have to admit that I...
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.520]   The worst part is that I've got it before because I'm like rent for 25 bucks.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   I'm not going to rent it.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   I'm going to wait.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.120]   The issue, the real issue for movies is that there is so much content available that I'm
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.280]   willing to just wait until it hits about...
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.560]   I'll buy it at about $14.99, $19.99.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.880]   I will not rent it at that number.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.240]   I really want it to be at $9.99 or $4.99.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.840]   The worst part is I root against the box office because that just means it's going to be more
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.760]   expensive for me to buy when I end up buying it.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.880]   I'm like, I just hope this bombs because that means that I can get it cheaper.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.480]   By the way, I have someone in the know who was listening to our show right now.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.320]   I just want to make sure we're totally accurate.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.560]   It says the states are the ones that have to validate the ID and require the servers
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.040]   and support.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.600]   It's not Apple holding our content.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.240]   It's the states that are still holding the content.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.480]   Which is probably why Apple is just providing the service.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480]   Right.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480]   But I'm just saying it was...
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.600]   I think I was driving him a little crazy.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.040]   I guess that's good to watch.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040]   I would have...
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.680]   I don't think it was an accurate choice between big techs ID and federal ID or state ID.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.680]   It's all state...
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.800]   I would have paid 100 bucks for a due and at home if I could have seen it.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.360]   I would have paid easily.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.000]   So yeah, we watched not to get away for free on HBO Max.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   It was way good.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   We didn't get it on HBO Max.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.600]   I just keep on getting better equipment at home.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.040]   I'm looking at a bigger, a better screen.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040]   I'm not looking at it.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040]   Like, when will I go back to theater?
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040]   I'm just going back to a better screen.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.480]   I already have a pretty good audio system.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.120]   And so I'm turning it out up.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.880]   Yeah, actually, I'm pretty happy sitting six feet away from my OLED screen.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.720]   How's that popcorn made, Popper?
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.320]   The popcorn is 10 times better thanks to you.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.080]   Oh, so I have a question for Alex.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.760]   Lisa actually said yesterday, thank Alex Lindsay again.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.200]   Can I ask Alex a quick question?
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.480]   Because I'm very confused right now.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.680]   So Disney Plus finally debuted Chang-See.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.680]   And it's called...
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.680]   What is it?
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.680]   IMAX extended or IMAX?
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.200]   I don't understand that at all.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.200]   Yeah, I saw that too.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.600]   What am I actually watching?
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.200]   I actually can't say that I...
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.800]   It's one by nine.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   You don't know.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.760]   Yeah, I don't know what that...
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.360]   I think that it's the IMAX orientation or whatever.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.520]   I think it's good.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   The uncrop it?
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.880]   Like they take a little bit of the crop off the top and bottom to fill our TVs better?
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880]   I don't know.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.480]   It's an extended aspect ratio.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.800]   So it's like one to 90 to one.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.600]   26 more per picture.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.400]   So it's a little bit more...
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.960]   Yeah, I haven't quite figured it out yet.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.200]   I think they just simulate what it's like to buy your tickets late and be sitting up
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.200]   front.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.400]   So it's like keystone like a million degrees.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:49.160]   All you see are like huge feet and tiny hips.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.160]   Let me see.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.000]   Here's the promo for it.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.400]   Oh, yes.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.600]   Extreme bars.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   That's what it is.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.600]   Look at that.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.000]   Oh, it's not extreme bars.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.160]   It's opening it up.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   Okay.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   So what you were getting...
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.160]   So it's taking a two, three, five and expanding it.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.160]   Okay, that's good.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.880]   Christopher Nolong is that a diverse...
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   Christopher Nolong.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.280]   Okay, that's good.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.000]   I think that's good, right?
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.680]   By the way that with the popcorn, ghee.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.160]   So Neraligazjar, who's...
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.160]   Oh, God.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.440]   It was a friend that said, "You gotta add the...
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.160]   Use ghee for the popcorn."
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.520]   I actually don't put butter.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.440]   The popcorn that you recommend, which is we should say Amish.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.520]   Amish country, mushroom.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.360]   It's a size, not the flavor.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.080]   Mushroom sized popcorn, available on Amazon.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.200]   It's very, very good.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:52.000]   And I do it in a thick, walled, whirly pop, not the cheesy tin ones.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.800]   We can't get the one you use because they don't make it anymore.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   But I just put...
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.800]   I do what you...
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.800]   I put a little salt in with the oil.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   But instead of the oil, Neralig put the...
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   Oh gee, instead of oil.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   Instead of oil.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.000]   Oh, yeah, because ghee has a very high smoke point.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.080]   So, oh, oh.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.600]   Ghee is simply clarified butter for those of you who don't.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.600]   Just take the milk salads out of butter and it doesn't burn.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   Oh!
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.800]   If 60% is buttery smooth, then 120% is ghee smooth.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.800]   Oh gee smooth.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.480]   I might be trying that tonight, Alex.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.440]   You fueled Monday night football last night, so thank you.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   Very good.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.440]   Very good.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   Niners, baby.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.440]   Wow.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.400]   I would love to send them a more popcorner thing.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.800]   Get better graphics.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.880]   You know, the hard part is if you go out to Sunday night football and then you watch
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.880]   Monday night football, you're much better.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.480]   But they also have better announcers too, by the way.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.400]   Well, no, here's the thing is that they have Tony Romo on...
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.600]   What we need is Tony Romo on Sunday night football and then it would be the best.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.600]   Yes, I agree.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.720]   I mean, Chris Collinsworth is fine.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720]   He's good.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:05.800]   But the thing is, is the Monday night football team is doing the Sunday night football game
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800]   now, the old one.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:07.800]   Yes, the good team.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800]   The one that used to be a football before it went to ESPN.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.320]   The good team went to Friday Sunday night football and then they have some other team
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.600]   that it always feels like is slightly better than a college game.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.680]   You know, it's going to get even worse because as Amazon starts doing more and more, they
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.920]   own Thursday night, but somehow they still let the network broadcast it.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.920]   But as Amazon does more and more, I have a bad feeling about this.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.240]   Anyway, that's sport ball and I know none of you care about that at all.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.040]   So we'll just move on.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.600]   I was mostly talking about the graphics though.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600]   Yeah, that gets true.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600]   It's about the graphics, man.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.600]   It's not about the game.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.400]   NBA 2K 2.22 is pretty good.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.720]   The new story mode I think I'm enjoying.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   I'm following...
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720]   He's pulling us back.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   I'm falling.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:58.320]   Can I just say that I love this part of 2021 where it's like, I've never been like following
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.280]   players on basketball, but there's a couple of game channels where they've created characters
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.520]   and I'm not like, oh, geez.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.640]   Okay, well, he's got to spend some more time in G-League if he thinks he's going to make
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.240]   it pass like round one of the draft.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.640]   Like, oh, round, he got drafted.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   He got drafted.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   So yes.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.520]   So just getting back to the IMAX expanded aspect ratio.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.120]   Do you need a special TV to do that or will your TV look...
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.320]   They have certified TVs that they say work better with it, but the specs for those TVs
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   seem all over the place.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.240]   I think that's probably just a licensing grab.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.600]   It looks like as long as you have a TV that like any modern TV will force myself to watch
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.040]   a Marvel movie just so I can tell you how it works on my 20...
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   I think it's just 2016.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.680]   I think it's like, because you did Chinese studies.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.680]   I think I really...
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680]   I will watch Shang-Chi.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.680]   Okay, that's a good one.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:43.680]   I'll watch Shang-Chi.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   And there's so much in Mandarin.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   Can I say this is my...
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   Okay, sorry.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   I'm just...
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.880]   This is what I'm listening for when I hear people talk about the latest Marvel movie.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.360]   It's like there's a flag that says, "Is this a real movie or is this a Marvel movie?"
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.440]   So to speak.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.640]   And Shang-Chi is...
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.120]   I'm so interested in it because people are saying, "No, no, no.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.120]   It's like Black Panther.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.000]   It's an actual movie.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.440]   It's not like a quarter billion dollar episode of a soap opera.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.440]   So yes, you will not be a baffling ordeal to figure out what the story is or who any
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.000]   of these people are or why any of this is important.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   According to why...
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   Jackie Chan's stunt team.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.760]   The number of TVs from companies like Sony, HySense, and TCL support IMACS enhanced.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.280]   You can have an IMACS enhanced compatible TV.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.560]   And it's possible that some hardware could get updated to support it.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.520]   Many TVs or sound systems are technically capable of outputting the kind of color, brightness,
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.880]   or audio quality that standard requires, but were shipped as was mine before it was introduced
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.760]   in 2018.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.520]   Some devices have been updated.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.320]   Pioneer and Ankyo adds Dolby Othmos and IMACS.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.320]   Oh, it's not even...
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.720]   It's a new sound.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.320]   It's an IMACS enhanced audio too.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320]   There you go, fold.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.160]   So I guess DTS has a competing standard to Dolby Othmos, of course.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.400]   And this is only a Disney Plus for now anyway.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.560]   It's so difficult now to figure out what can my TV do?
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.520]   Why would these features matter to me?
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.600]   Like when they're trying to tell you, "Oh, well, this one has immersive sound."
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600]   Like, okay.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.920]   Now it's not just like 3D, where am I going to appreciate it?
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.760]   But it's also like, I have a TV that I bought three years ago and I'm using the cable that
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.880]   came with the TV to plug it into my AV receiver.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.240]   Will these things actually make it through to my speakers and my TV?
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.520]   It's like, I have to this year, I feel it's so I have to...
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.560]   After not having really paid much attention to my home theater setup, I feel like I have
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.520]   to do an audit of every single part of that link to figure out what can each of these
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:53.680]   boxes and cables do and can invest in $50 in little cables and little things, unlock
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.520]   things that I'm supposed to be getting, but am not.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.040]   I mean, very confusing.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:01.440]   The bottom line is if the AVR knows what it's getting, if it knows it's getting atmos, it
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.680]   gets a little more complicated with other formats, but if it knows it's getting atmos,
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.960]   it's going to do what it needs to do depending on how many speakers you have plugged into
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.960]   it.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.120]   So you have to tell it what you have.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:19.200]   So say I've got 5.1 or 5.14 or 7.12 or whatever you have there or the bar will have its own
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.520]   thing that it'll convert from that HDMI signal.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.560]   But if you have an AVR, it should know, oh, I'm getting an HD if it's modern.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.000]   I mean, if it doesn't support atmos, then it doesn't support atmos.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.320]   But if it does, the Apple TV going into the AVR will immediately...
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.480]   The AVR will do everything it needs to do as long as it knows how many speakers and you'll
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.400]   know that you know the AVR knows how many speakers because you did a test with a mic
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.520]   to find out in the sweet spot to know where all the speakers are supposed to be and all
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   that stuff.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.440]   And that might come with the AVR.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.520]   I bought an old B-Atmos compatible receiver so that I could hear Apple music.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.520]   I think it was an audio.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.520]   You had a Dennon?
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.520]   No, it was a Dennon.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.520]   You're right, it was a Dennon.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.160]   Dennons are a relatively recent Dennon.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160]   But I didn't notice...
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.160]   I don't think it...
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   I think Apple...
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   I don't know.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.320]   Anyway, Apple Surround I think doesn't use it or something.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.320]   I don't know.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   But anyway.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   Wow, definitely.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   I have a Dennon.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   Does it use it on yours?
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320]   Oh yeah.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:22.960]   So I'm using an Apple TV going into the Dennon receiver, but it just says stereo.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.920]   Well, how many speakers do you have connected to the Dennon?
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.520]   It's a 5-1 system.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   It should...
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.600]   Well, it's the...
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.120]   It is what the receiver is identifying itself with to the Apple.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.560]   I wonder if there's something I need to tell the Apple TV to do.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560]   Well, it should be the...
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.280]   I'm listening to Apple Music, the spatial music and Apple Music.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:49.680]   I actually spent 400 bucks on a new receiver hoping I would get this.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.320]   I don't know.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320]   Mine, I can...
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320]   Now I have a 7...
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:58.560]   Do you see it's a Dolby Atmos when you're playing spatial music?
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   Yes, it's a Xamos.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.560]   And when you regular stereo music, it goes back, right?
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   Yep.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.560]   I must have done that.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560]   That's an identification.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.160]   Because as soon as it does that, it starts putting...
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.000]   And I can tell you, I mean, it is.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.200]   I'm literally about to install.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.240]   During next week, I'm tearing my office apart and putting it back together in a different
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240]   way.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:20.840]   But I've got 7-1-4 individual speakers that are going into my home office.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:28.080]   And the reason is because both at our office, where I have 5-1-4 and my living room at 7-1,
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.240]   listening to the music is amazing.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.680]   I mean, because I can hear things coming off on either side.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.480]   I can hear it coming from behind.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.200]   The only thing I don't hear right now is above in my home office, but I definitely
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.200]   hear it in my office office.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.560]   I wonder maybe I don't have the right HDMI cable or something.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560]   Maybe.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.400]   But are you using mono price?
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:51.400]   Oh, I'm using whatever is in the box full of HDMI cables.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.880]   The reason I ask is that we've been having a lot of metadata problems with mono price
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.280]   specifically.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.840]   I buy a lot of mono price cables.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.040]   And we found that I kept on trying to figure out, why does this cable not work and one
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   other cable does.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:13.880]   And I kind of started to sort out that the mid-range ones, the 10, 15, 20, 25 all don't
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.760]   seem to carry the metadata correctly.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.320]   And I don't know why.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.560]   The short ones, well, I've lots of short ones.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.040]   And then really long mono price ones that are one way work fine.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.360]   But this in-between stage, there's something missing there.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.600]   I can't control the black magic cameras, can't get atmos, can't get a bunch of other things
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.600]   in them.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   There's a free line.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.600]   Just put up that.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600]   Yep.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.800]   I was going to say there's a video that lines put up that shows failure.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800]   Okay, go ahead Eddie.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800]   No, no, no.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:41.280]   I was going to say the fact that both of us were excited about recommending the same
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:45.040]   really great Linus Tech Tips video that will address exactly your situation.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.040]   I'm the hype man and now you actually deliver it.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.080]   So Linus did a video where they bought a bunch of cables from a bunch of different vendors
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.760]   and they put them through testing to determine just basically failure rates for these cables.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.520]   And the failure rates were much higher than I think they expected.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.440]   I expected anyone expected, especially for mono price.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.720]   But even for really expensive Belkins and the longer they got, you got over 10 feet, the
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.200]   failure rates got really, really high.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:14.400]   Some of the cables would work, but increasing numbers wouldn't work at all.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.400]   So it's-
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Well especially at 4K.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.400]   Do you remember what Brandi said?
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.400]   The basics were okay.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.400]   I'm always just at the cable matters.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.400]   I've had great results for that.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.960]   I know Benson Leong has recommended for USB-C to go with cable matters.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.720]   So I see Amazon has some cable matters, HDMI cables.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.280]   These are the latest standard.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.880]   I think they recommended active for over 10 feet.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.920]   Okay, but I'm not going to go over 10 feet.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:40.600]   I'm just going to do three meter cables, but not three meter, two meter cables.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.240]   But Alex, I'm definitely texting you the link to this.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:50.360]   Not only so that you can see the testing, but also they have this amazing box that tests
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.440]   all kinds of cables.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.400]   You just chalk in like the HDMI module and will give you a really detailed report.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   I think we have that box.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   Don't we have that box?
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   I think we have that box.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.400]   Nice diagrams too.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.040]   This is three.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:08.280]   These cable matters three pack for $19 seems like that's a pretty darn good price.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.440]   And I think cable matters makes excellent cables.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.520]   So I'll tell you what, I will buy these and let you know if that fixes the problem.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.640]   And I get eight K cables, not because I'm doing eight K, but because eight K cables make
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.960]   really good four K cables.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.720]   That's what I figure.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720]   Right?
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.720]   Over sampling.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.720]   Over sampling.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.400]   One, I think the failure for HDMI 2.1 was way higher than HDMI.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]   Oh, really?
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   Oh, especially over 10.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   And some of the 2.0 could handle 2.1.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.000]   It was just like the specification wasn't updated.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   The funny thing is that the Apple, the old Apple cables, which I hold on to like gold,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.280]   for some reason would work all the time.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.240]   Like everywhere, all the time, you know, 4K, you know, whatever.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.720]   And it's like they built them for a future they didn't need them for.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.120]   They got rid of them by the time they got there, but they work really well.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.120]   They don't make them anymore.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.800]   You have to find them.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.920]   So I'm going to now see, I was just thinking, well, maybe spatial audio is designed for
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.560]   two speakers.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.280]   So I should just live with that.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.640]   But now you got me going.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.560]   I spent the money on the receiver.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.120]   I want my gosh, Lauren, surround.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120]   Want my atmos.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120]   I want my atmos.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.120]   Let's take a little break.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.120]   Come back with more.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.120]   Renee Richie.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   Plug it.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.120]   Look at you, Mr. Colab plug it in Linus Tech Tips.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   Look at you.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   He is Canadian.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   Oh, he is.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.120]   I didn't know that.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.120]   All right.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.120]   That case.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   He's in Vancouver.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.280]   Andy Enoco from WGBH and Point East.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   He's at Enoco.com.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.240]   And of course, from 090.media and office hours.global.alex.ly.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.360]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.800]   Whether you're a seasoned IT professional or you're trying to get that first job in IT,
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.720]   ITProTV is the community you need.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.400]   Big fans of their founders.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.400]   I know them well.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.760]   Tim Brum and Don Pezzette just think the world of these guys.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.920]   They created ITProTV because it was the training they wanted for themselves.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.280]   And now, man, they have done so well.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280]   I'm so proud of them.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.240]   They have seven studios now in their Gainesville, Florida headquarters.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:22.760]   They're filming every day, taping, digitizing every day, Monday through Friday.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.760]   They use the best trainers, all experts in the field, but also selected for their ability
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.240]   to communicate, engage for their passion.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.280]   So you'll enjoy watching them explain how all this stuff works.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.040]   Because they have those studios running so much, they move stuff into the course library
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.720]   within 24 hours.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.400]   Their library is the most up-to-date library out there.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:49.040]   That's important because the test changed, the certs changed.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.000]   There's always new versions of software, and so they're always up-to-date.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.440]   The official video training partner for CompTIA means you're going to get the best CompTIA
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.440]   training.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:04.920]   And of course, those are the certs that people need to get started up most often, like A+
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.320]   Security+.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.320]   You can learn anytime from the comfort of your own home on your own schedule.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:14.880]   All the shows, all the episodes are divided into 20 to 30 minute chunks, so it's very
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.960]   easy to do it on your lunch hour, whenever you've got a minute.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.480]   They even have really nice transcripts that are searchable, which means you can actually
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:25.560]   go to a part of, let's say there's an exam question you really haven't trouble with,
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:31.400]   you can go to the exact part of the course and find that information you need fast.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.160]   This month, AWS month, they've been doing monthly programs, which is great.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.320]   Coming up in a couple of days, they're going to do a webinar on Cloud Data Protect on AWS,
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.840]   featuring Tracy Pierce, Senior Security Consultant for AWS.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.400]   It's 2PM Eastern, but don't worry because you can see all the webinars on demand after
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:56.440]   the fact that itpro.tv/webinars, itpro.tv/webinars.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.440]   You can see what's coming up.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.120]   You can catch up on any of you who missed that are on demand.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.120]   There's lots of them there.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.400]   I think itpro.tv is pretty darn amazing.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.520]   I'm really proud of these guys.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.480]   And all those great entertainers, start your IT career today by getting educated and certified.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.280]   Great companies are starved for IT professionals right now.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.560]   Make a lot more money with a job.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.840]   It's really satisfying.

[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.560]   And that helps us quite a bit.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.560]   Let's see.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.160]   Oh boy, we're really hearing from a lot of people that app tracking transparency is
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.880]   it's bad for our business.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.200]   Peloton is now the latest.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:15.480]   They're blaming app tracking for making it more difficult to gain new app subscribers
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.000]   as Mark Gurman tweeting for digital subscriptions.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.640]   However, subscriptions are up.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.960]   So they didn't see how though, did they unless I missed it?
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.080]   Yeah, sure how it would be, right?
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.400]   How is it like we're not stalking you when you go to visit a health club website so we
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.400]   know how to target you.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.960]   Is that like, I don't know.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   Well, that's probably it.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:40.320]   Let's say you put Peloton's app on there, which you can do without any Peloton hardware.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.840]   And they see that you go work out at the club because they are tracking you.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.000]   Let's face it.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.120]   Then they say, oh, well, this person's active.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:53.840]   We really should serve them an ad the next time they're on Instagram for our bikes.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:59.560]   Well, it's also it's just building this larger web that they use for most of the stuff.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.200]   So the way, you know, the way a lot of this works is that, you know, we're tracking a
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.040]   bunch of information about you, but we're inter-coelating it with everybody else at the same time.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:12.040]   So everybody else that goes to the gym or everybody else that uses Peloton or everybody
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:18.120]   else that so for instance, you know, there's a little Facebook bit that sits on a website.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.840]   You go to that website.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.160]   It's not just affecting you.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.440]   It's affecting everyone that knows you because it goes, okay, well, these people might be
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:29.040]   connected and if they're using the apps and all the information, it allows them to kind
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.440]   of cross pollinate all that all that data.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:37.560]   So it's really, I mean, the tracking stuff is very, very powerful.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.600]   You know, and I think that the what people are voting for constantly is that they don't
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.600]   want to play anymore.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:47.920]   You know, like they, you know, and I think, I mean, not everybody, only like, what is
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.920]   it, 85%.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.560]   So it's like, I don't, I think it's 85%.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.040]   It's a very high number.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040]   Very high number of people.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.760]   I don't even think about it and I'm not even against app tracking, but it just, you know
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.720]   what it sounds, the way Apple phrases it, allow this app to track you across all the
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:05.720]   other apps.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.440]   Like, remember when the Bluetooth warning came on and you suddenly realized all these apps
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.920]   that had nothing to do with Bluetooth.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:11.920]   I know you're not.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.920]   You're trying to get your Bluetooth.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.920]   And now it's like all these apps that aren't even ad apps.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.120]   They're like, they're just like really, you know, I would tell it's not one.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.120]   I don't want to.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   Exactly.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.120]   It was even, it was like the CTV and like the Canadian national network apps were all tracking
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.120]   me a crime.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   I didn't, I had no idea that they were doing that.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   Why is it TV?
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.120]   I know it's.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.840]   Like, you know, it's just, you know, it's, it's, it's when you're, it's just, yeah, you
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.360]   just get into this thing like really like you had to do that, you know, and I feel like
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.840]   that way every time I get the website one as well is just like, you were really pulling
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.360]   all that information like PG&E you were tr, you were tracing me, you know, just, it's
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.200]   just really, I guess I find it a little insulting.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.880]   And I, and I think that, you know, I, I get the argument that it's more relevant.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.040]   I really come to the conclusion thinking more and more about it.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.400]   I don't want my ads to be relevant.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.960]   I don't want to constantly be making a decision about that.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.280]   Like, I just don't want them to be smarter about that.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.120]   I feel like it's a constant, you know, lower brain stimulus that I'm not interested in
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   anymore.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.840]   And so it's, it's not just that it's, I feel like they're stealing our privacy.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.080]   I feel like they're stealing our sanity.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.920]   You know, I think that's part of what turns us.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.920]   Well, some concealer your sanity.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.920]   I'm not just clearly Alex.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:12.920]   You're going crazy.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:13.920]   Fine.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.920]   No.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:23.240]   I guess if you, if you, if you didn't say that for decades, if you didn't know about it.
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.240]   So who's stealing your sanity?
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.240]   Well, you want to learn your things you don't want to buy?
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.440]   I don't think the way it's, I don't think, I don't think that people understand how
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.600]   deep it is though.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:35.200]   Like it's, it's, it's this cross pollination of all of the data.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.960]   When you go to Safeway, they're cross pollinating what you buy, you know, with, with what, what
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:40.960]   sites you go to.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.360]   And, and all of those things are, are them, you know, and then every post that you see
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.880]   and every little ad and all these other things.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.880]   And I'm just not, you know, like, I think that people are getting tired of, I don't think
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   it's just me.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:55.200]   I think given the response to the app, in the app store, I think that, that I'm, that
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.800]   I'm not the only one that has decided they don't want to play anymore.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.000]   Well, it's all about, it's all about, okay, that's a bigger loyalty card.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   Sorry, Andy.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.760]   It's, it's, it's all about knowledge and transparency.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:09.920]   It's like for years and years and years, I think that people had no real awareness of
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:14.080]   the working conditions of people who are making our clothes, we're assembling our phones,
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.720]   we're doing stuff like that.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:21.600]   And that's why, that's why companies were able to continue to not really care about that.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:27.160]   But once the, once that becomes more visual, it doesn't, it doesn't matter, like the economic
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.080]   reasons why a company decided to go that direction.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:34.400]   It doesn't matter if they want to argue that, well, the thing is this is, this is racers,
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.800]   at this level of the market, they're absolutely racers slim margins.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.160]   And also Walmart is actually demanding that if we can possibly pay our workers less, we
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.120]   must pay our workers less by contract.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.520]   That doesn't matter because as consumers, we're the ones who have to make the decisions.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.240]   We have the ones that have to be comfortable with how we're spending our money.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:57.880]   And when, and although I, if this were a longer discussion, you have to factor in that people
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.040]   don't want to pay for stuff.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.480]   And if you give them something superb that they don't have to pay for, they don't really
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.400]   think about like how well you're forcing it.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.320]   If you're not going to give us $18 a month for this amazing list manager that saves you
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.000]   $18,000 a year, we're going to have to monetize it somehow.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.360]   So that is part of the discussion.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.520]   But the thing is, people are not going to find things palatable simply because they don't
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520]   know about it.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.360]   Once you start informing people about this sort of stuff, this is going to have to force
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.440]   you to change your business.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.520]   And it's not that no one will shut a tear about it.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:34.880]   I just post, I'm trying to find it about Walmart testing out stores with hundreds of
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:35.880]   cameras.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.800]   If I could find this picture of it, it's kind of chilling in my head.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.440]   There's a camera every few feet.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]   Oh, don't worry.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.440]   They're just using it to abuse their hourly laborers.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.440]   It's not for the consumers.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.440]   Oh, good.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.440]   As long as that's all it's for, I'm fine.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:54.400]   They decided to introduce this new micro dock payment system where if they figure out that
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   you hesitated before putting that can of beans on the shelf, they're going to dock you
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.960]   for the eight-tenths of a cent in which you weren't actually putting the beans on the
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.960]   shelf.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:07.040]   Well, it is like those Vegas Vegas mini bars where if you just remove the peanuts, they
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.680]   charge you because they got little brancers.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.840]   Maybe iPhone 14 will have an EPM or like one of those pulse things that will just blind
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   all the cameras.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:19.280]   One of the features that they offer, iPhone 14 now with camera blocking.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.280]   I don't know.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.280]   There's something wrong with me.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.480]   I just don't care.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.480]   It's fine.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.480]   What am I hiding?
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   I don't care.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   They can know I can.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480]   That's not hiding.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   That's your choice to make.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   I guess.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   I don't know.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.280]   So long as you understand the transaction you're entering into, as long as they wrote it down,
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.560]   as long as you read the contracts, so to speak before signing it, that's fine.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.160]   Again, Ray and I are, we're not polar opposites, but we definitely have different opinions
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.440]   on our relationships with Google.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:50.680]   I feel as though what Google gives me is worth what I'm giving them.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.080]   And also I have there above a certain level of minimum level of trust.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.880]   However, I'm glad that there is the iPhone out there.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:01.400]   I'm glad that there are alternative services out there in many cases for people who are
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.720]   like, I have read that contract and I'm not willing to sign it.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.880]   I don't want to do business with these people.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.680]   Walmart says this is a story from two years ago actually, but I guess it's stuck in my
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.680]   mind.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.000]   It says they're only using it for restocking, but look at the camera.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.440]   If I went to the store and I saw cameras like that film the Matrix bullet time on that.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.800]   That is every, I mean, every square inch, but they say we're not doing it.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.240]   This was a, I don't know, a concept a couple of years ago.
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.400]   I don't know if they ever implemented it.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.680]   So Leo, my whole thing is like, it's a revenue share.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.680]   Like if you go in the door, that essentially is the EULA.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.960]   You're saying I agree to be photographed, but usually they need a model release that have
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:44.680]   to compensate you for your time, maybe you get a wardrobe budget.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.320]   And I feel the same as Andy.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.400]   Like I think YouTube is a fair deal for me with Google Photos.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.840]   I like a little bit of cash to help train their machine learning.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:52.840]   I don't think that's too wrong.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.840]   Would you give us all of those Amazon grab and go stores where they know what you bought
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.800]   because they got cameras and you logged in when you walked in and then you just walked
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:02.800]   out.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.040]   The first time I went to Apple when they had the, like you would just scan yourself and
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.920]   walk out, I thought for sure I'd be chopped, locked on my way out the store.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.160]   I thought there's no way this could work.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.360]   They're going to think I'm a shop lifter that giant goon side there.
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.800]   It's going to take me down so quick.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.200]   It was so anxiety.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.600]   And I feel the same thing.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.960]   It's like maybe there's stuff's working.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:21.400]   Maybe I'm about to be arrested.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:26.240]   That I did talk to someone at an Apple store one time, just talking about the exact thing
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.440]   because it just feels like you're stealing every single time.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.680]   You pay for it on your phone and it just feels like somebody is going to at least talk to
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:37.040]   you and then you just walk out and just like, go ahead, take it.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.280]   And I talked to someone and I said, yeah, that's not how people steal stuff from us.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.680]   Like, that's not the way it happens.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.680]   Right.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:49.200]   I have to say that I would want to, if they're not paying somebody to give me personal service,
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.640]   I'm not mad about it.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.640]   I'm not upset about it.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.280]   But I want to get full value out of it.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.680]   So after I complete the purchase, I would have that thing and I would just run out the
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:04.320]   door and let's say we spend a mental ban with that to check to see did he pay for that before
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.160]   figuring out what just had happened?
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:11.840]   I'm already enjoying, there's a liquor store within walking distance that I buy, like ice
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.840]   and sodas from.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.600]   But it's like, I kind of enjoy, like, now I feel the reservoir dogs, going in my head,
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.600]   when I'm walking the parking lot and I put on my mask.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.520]   Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:30.840]   I think we've seen from the cameras from Apple stores is that no one's going to stop you.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:36.360]   Like, they're not going to stop you, but the problem is is that for policy, that's safety
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.040]   and the policy of customer safety of workers, yeah, they don't want an interaction.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:43.840]   And so, but they, but you're running with a phone that they can track.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.840]   Like, like, you're a well-documented word.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.600]   Also, they were tracking your phone as you walk down because we know that they're not,
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.520]   they're not like, oh, we don't have any beacons that are looking for Bluetooth signatures
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.880]   or IDM and it's like, no, they're probably going to get you.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:05.000]   But Apple's iPhone 12 announcement that featured 5G pretty heavily, as I remember.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.240]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240]   I think, 5G.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240]   5G.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.920]   Actually, it might be the C-band 5G, which is around 5 megahertz, is being slowed down
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:22.960]   18T and Verizon are delaying 5G's rollout because the FAA says, it interferes with airplane safety.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.560]   Yeah, we're not allowing-- I think it's airports in Canada.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.320]   We finally got to a point where we don't have to turn off our phones in the plane.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:35.200]   Because the towers are bringing the planes down now, that's good.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.600]   It would limit pilots' use of certain automated cockpit systems such as--
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.560]   I don't think it's the towers.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.560]   I don't think it's the towers.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.560]   I think it's the people in the plane, I think, are what's affecting.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.840]   No, it's from the towers.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:49.840]   Okay.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.160]   Such as those that help planes land in poor weather, those limits would aim to avoid potential
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.280]   interference from wireless towers on the ground.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:06.560]   This is according to the Wall Street Journal transmitting the new C-band 5G signals.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.560]   So yeah.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:10.320]   Yeah, what are people complaining to?
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.320]   Gee.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.840]   The FCC has gotten way over it, Ski.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.480]   I mean, it is this greed of like, how many spectrums can we sell?
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.760]   Let's get rid of everybody's wireless transmitters for their phone.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.560]   18T and Verizon's been asking.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.200]   It's a school of billions of dollars on those licenses.
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.880]   Well, but think about-- yeah, because it's a really good-- it's a really good frequency.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.880]   This will solve a lot of 5G problems.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.280]   3.7, 4.2 gigahertz doesn't make it really.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.280]   Gigahertz, it's the--
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.280]   It's the really good frequency.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.720]   Kind of the Wi-Fi spectrum.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   It is, but the-- it's a really good frequency, but the problem really is is that, you know,
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.560]   again, the FCC taking away so many wireless transmitters from people, like, you know,
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:57.600]   whether you're a professional, school, church, like all of their mic, you know, all of their
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.200]   mics had to be repurchased.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:02.880]   And so they moved the money from the wireless.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.240]   I mean, the millions and millions and millions-- I don't know if it's the equal amount of
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:13.280]   moving, but they basically pressed a cost onto consumers by moving those frequencies
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.200]   and for, I don't know, I mean, they'll be-- you know, we'll be talking about 6G or something
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:20.280]   else by the time this actually rolls out.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:27.480]   It actually can contribute to supply chain shortages because they have to ground cargo
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.520]   flights as well as passenger flights.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.560]   The presentation by a coalition of aviation groups to the White House has expected this
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.160]   week to warn that the potential FAA restrictions could result in airports or even regions being
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:47.440]   shut down as passengers and shippers experience flight cancellations, delays, and diversions.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:55.720]   So it's a battle between the, you know, telecos, the FCC and the airlines.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.720]   Wasn't America mismanaged?
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.720]   Like, wasn't all the frequent?
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:02.000]   Like, a lot of the European and other countries are rolling out very regulated, very well thought
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.160]   out 5G plans and it seems like America was just like, oh, we need to find more bandwidth.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.400]   Where can we get it from?
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.400]   It's just take it.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.360]   Well, it's just because we had it-- we were already using that bandwidth for something
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.240]   else and a lot of other regions weren't necessarily using that bandwidth for that.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.840]   So there was open bandwidth to grab onto and we are-- you know, we've been much more aggressive
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.840]   about it for 30 years.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:27.040]   And so it got us-- you know, we were ahead of it, but it really was a huge displacement
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.520]   for something that, you know, I don't know if I'll ever see where I live.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.240]   Like, I just don't, you know, like it's waste of money.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.360]   And unfortunately, that part of the infrastructure is a business infrastructure.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.040]   It's not considered part of national infrastructure, which I think is one of the biggest mistakes
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040]   that this country has ever made as a part of.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:49.920]   As a matter of policy, it should be owned by-- I'm not always a fan of government regulation,
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.400]   of government ownership of stuff, but it's like, no, no, no.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.680]   We own-- we are in control of people's access to broadband, of people's access to the communications
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.680]   network.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:05.120]   We will allow you to play in our pool and maybe make some money there, but we get to
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.040]   tell you exactly where you're going to be delivering services, how much you're going
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:13.960]   to be charging for it, and how fast you need to innovate in order to keep up with the average
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.880]   person in a lot of other countries.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.880]   It's terrible.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880]   So this is the Canadian announcement.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:21.080]   They said that the Ottawa-- Ottawa stuns telecoms.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.720]   A surprise announcement that Canadians living near airports won't get full 5G service.
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.040]   And this is mere weeks after they spent like $9 billion, I think it was two or three weeks,
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.200]   after the auction, Ottawa announced that they can't put it near airports.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.440]   So they're super happy.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:39.800]   Are you all excited about Disney melee mania?
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   Huh?
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.800]   Huh?
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.080]   Yeah, I'm going to go with it.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.080]   I'm just going to talk about Casserole.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.320]   Mickey Mouse, settling against Donald Duck.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.920]   Finally, we settled this.
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.920]   What?
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   It's our own.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.280]   Here's Mickey from the Sorcerer's Apprentice fighting--
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.280]   The only one.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.280]   --the only one.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.280]   It's Smash Brothers.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.640]   But it's like it's Smash Brothers for Nintendo, then for Nickelodeon, and now for Disney.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   I guess so.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.800]   From Wreck-It Ralph, Elsa, and Mickey Mouse to Frozone, Moana, and Buzz Lightyear, each
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:16.360]   player will choose their unique holographic hero to battle in three versus three matches
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.280]   with friends and foes.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.520]   Yeah, I want to see these beloved characters fight.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.780]   I want like a post-- I feel like they should be a good blood.
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.840]   Do you think they'll be death moves?
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.840]   Finish him.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.840]   OK.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.840]   OK.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.040]   Really famously last month they announced the last character for Nintendo Super Smash Brothers,
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.040]   and it was from Kingdom Hearts.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.920]   Everyone was hoping it was going to be Mickey or Donald or Goofy or somebody.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920]   That would be fun.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.480]   And it turned out to be just one of the normal characters.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.800]   And so that's probably because of this.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.880]   Now there's no way to actually have Mario punch Mickey.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.080]   You know, let's get two separate games for that, kids.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.840]   You shouldn't have to do that.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:58.880]   I enjoy it when game fans will reskin or will import the game-- excuse me, the character
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.160]   models from an innocuous game and then put it into a super violent game.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:04.840]   I think that's super, super funny.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.880]   But I think that when it comes to the licensee, I think they need to ask, it's OK to have
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.040]   these people-- it's OK to have these two characters fight each other in go-karts.
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.040]   That's fine.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.360]   It's just that when it's like punch, punch, punch, stab, stab, stab, well, maybe there's
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360]   a cartoon knife, I don't know.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.040]   It seems like more for Warner Brothers.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.920]   I mean, all I'm saying is don't be.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:24.920]   Don't pick Kenny.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:25.920]   I think if you're going to--
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.920]   Kenny dies every time.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.920]   Every--
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.920]   Oh my gosh.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.560]   No, no, no, see, that's what will make him dangerous.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:34.040]   He does not fear death one little bit.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.040]   He will take out the two of you.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:39.040]   It's not that we're talking.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:45.440]   Macro mode switch in iOS 15.2, beta 3, turn off the macro mode.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.440]   I don't know.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.640]   Is that even a news story?
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.440]   I guess it is.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:50.440]   All right.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:51.440]   I've run out.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:53.560]   I've literally used up everything I've got.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.960]   I've fired all the ammunition I can.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.640]   You guys shut it all down.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.240]   Let's take a break and then I will get you a chance to do your picks of the week.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.640]   Just a little bit.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.200]   Our show today brought to you by, I think, a company I can really get behind as I think
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.200]   with all our sponsors.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.080]   But in this case, this is something I'm a big believer in.
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.240]   We get on the radio show.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.440]   I have a lot of blind listeners because it's radio and they love it.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.840]   And I think probably it's true of all of our podcasts.
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:25.000]   But they're always telling me we could do better with accessibility.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.960]   Maybe your company could do better with accessibility.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.280]   It's always a challenge when you have a website thinking about, well, how do we make this more
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.280]   accessible?
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.560]   I've got a solution.
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.680]   Userway@userway.org.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:42.000]   According to the law, every website without exception needs to be accessible.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]   It's a public entity.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000]   In fact, there was a big court case, well-known national pizza chain, said, well, we've got
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.880]   a phone number.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.360]   That's accessible enough.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.800]   Supreme Court said, no, that's separate but equal.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:57.600]   Your public entity, your website has to be accessible.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:01.760]   The good news is it's easy thanks to userway.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.320]   It's the right thing to do but it's also the legal thing to do because you could be liable
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.320]   if you don't meet the Americans with Disability Act's law for accessibility.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:16.840]   Userway is an incredible AI-powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:22.120]   the web access guidelines, WCAG guidelines.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:24.960]   It's just a line of JavaScript you could put in your code.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960]   It goes out.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.920]   It gets everything working on your website.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.240]   What it basically does is it puts an accessibility layer in incorrectly so that screen readers
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:38.600]   and others can actually see that site in the way they need to.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.880]   Userway can do it with one line of code, achieve more than an entire team of developers.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.200]   One million websites use userway.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.640]   Some of the biggest in the world, Disney, uses it.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.360]   Coca-Cola, eBay, FedEx.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.640]   You might think, well, that means it's going to cost a lot of money.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.160]   No, in fact, when you find out how affordable it is, you might be shocked.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.160]   I was.
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.320]   It's very affordable.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.200]   It's always making its best-in-class enterprise-level accessibility tools available to small and
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.200]   medium businesses.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.840]   This is what we need to make the web accessible.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.040]   If you do scale, userway will be there with you.
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:15.920]   If they can handle Disney and eBay and Coca-Cola, they can certainly handle you.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.600]   An accessible compliance site is not just the right thing to do.
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.920]   It's good for business too.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.080]   60 million Americans have disabilities.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:28.040]   You don't want to lock them out of registration forms or nav menus or shopping carts.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:29.960]   Make it accessible.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:34.520]   Userway makes it possible for millions of people to purchase your products.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.720]   For years, userway has been on the cutting edge, creating innovative accessibility technologies
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.120]   that push the envelope of what's possible with AI and machine learning and computer
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.120]   vision.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.720]   It's kind of remarkable.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.400]   They're your eyes, in effect.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.600]   Userway's AI automatically fixes violations at the code level, auto generates image alts,
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.800]   writes descriptions for you.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:58.160]   You can, by the way, enhance those if you want.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.600]   Remediates complex nav menus, ensures that all the pop-ups are accessible, fixes vague
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.600]   link violations, fixes any broken links, ensures your website makes use of accessible colors
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.040]   while remaining true to your brand.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.680]   And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your site.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.880]   And as I said, you can easily then go in there and tweak it if you want.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.720]   Completely platform agnostic works everywhere.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.720]   WordPress Shopify wicks.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.480]   It's just an easy cost-effective way to make your site accessible.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.360]   It works with AEM Site Core SharePoint.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.280]   Even your own hand-coded site.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:37.680]   Userway integrates seamlessly.

[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.760]   This just in, I missed the big story of the day.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.920]   A big update to the Simpsons tapped out.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.920]   Thank you, ScooterX.
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:53.160]   You're still playing the Simpsons tapped out, ScooterX.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.960]   Holy cow.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.280]   I want my donuts back.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:03.120]   Speaking of donuts, let's say hi to Renee Ritchie for his pick of the week.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.200]   All right, so this is just the light to me on so many levels.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.160]   As a designer, an iOS designer, an Apple designer, independent designer, Michael Flarrup, and
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:15.720]   he's put together a book of iOS icons.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:21.640]   A look back, a historical big coffee table, the app icon book.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:25.720]   And it's got some of these, I haven't seen the hypstematic icon in years.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:30.320]   Like just so many apps that had, especially the pre-IOS seven days when they had these
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.440]   rich textured, lickable icons.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.800]   And this has the involvement of so many of the developers.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:43.040]   And this is like, you can, we'll fight over this if you want to, but this is an art form.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:47.360]   And so many designers took so much time and effort to make each one of these like pixel
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.360]   perfect.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.640]   It took huge pride in them.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:53.440]   It was, you know, it was how it was like the first appearance your app would make.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.440]   You would look at the store and some people would make like, am I going to download this
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.440]   or that just based entirely on how the icon looked, how good the icon looked.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.440]   And they're still really fantastic with the history of the tweetbot icon.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:07.120]   This just appeals to me and my background is in design.
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.520]   So I'm predisposed to love this, but just the idea of being able to have something that
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:16.560]   is this much of a love letter to the art of icon design.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:19.120]   It just, it makes me feel so happy.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:20.360]   And it's a Kickstarter.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:25.080]   So always with Kickstarter, you know, be warned that it's not a promise of a, I'm an exchange,
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.240]   it's a support of a dream.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:31.200]   A lot of them do get realized some don't, but just this, this looks so wonderful.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.760]   I had to, I had to back it immediately.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.520]   It's been nice coffee table book, wouldn't it?
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:35.520]   I love this.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:41.400]   I love the challenge of icon design where it's like, no, you don't get an entire wall to
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.400]   do a mural.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:46.040]   You get this tiny space that is probably going to be squeezed down to a tiny little
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.240]   after or so.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:50.600]   Not only does it have to have a function of telling, making sure that it's part of the
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.400]   identity of the app, but it also has to be clear.
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.320]   It has to be beautiful.
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:57.600]   It's, it's, it's like bridge design where it's not enough that this, the Golden Gate
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:00.240]   bridge be a very pretty looking iconic structure.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:02.600]   It has to function as a bridge.
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.960]   And now you take that, you have to also make the bridge like three quarters of an inch
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:09.800]   by three quarters of an inch and you get some of the biggest superstars of graphic design
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.560]   and art at participating in this.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.440]   And by the way, the book is almost completely done.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:17.640]   It's not like you're, you're saying here, take a, take a thousand dollars and we'll
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:18.640]   see in three years.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:19.640]   I just always warn people with Kickstarter.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:23.560]   If you go back to the pictures of the designers, Leo, like if you, if you just take a look
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:25.320]   at who's, um, it's big names.
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:33.320]   Like Mark Edwards is pajango and like this, there's so many such really, really good people involved
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:34.320]   in this.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:36.320]   Um, I think this is a great idea.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.320]   It's also interesting to me because normally you'd go to Chronicle Books or somebody and
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.840]   say, Hey, I want to publish this book and they probably give you a green light and
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:46.360]   you maybe you'd get 50 cents on the dollar if you were lucky.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.960]   Um, instead go to Kickstarter do it yourself nowadays.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.080]   That's probably a reasonable way to do it.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:53.880]   They've, they wanted $11,000 to do it.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.880]   They've got $118,000.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:55.880]   I know.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.640]   I think they're well on that way.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:01.800]   The, the old crap moment of the American Kickstarter say that I was ready to print and
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:06.640]   ship 500 of these and now I have to start an entire business and go to my job just to,
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.360]   just to complete my obligations.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.800]   I mean, I can't think of their own book, right?
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.800]   I don't know.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.480]   28 people bought the hard cover.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:18.960]   Uh, I mean, I would be, it would be funny if we find out that was the advance that some
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.160]   book company offered them.
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.800]   That's why a little, I think you're right.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.160]   I bet that's exactly right.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.560]   That was so this is what they said they'd pay us.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.640]   What would you pay us for this?
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.160]   This is the right way to do a book these days.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:34.040]   And nowadays there are plenty of print on demand places.
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.120]   It'll do gorgeous work.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.880]   I think this is smart.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:42.920]   Neat Kickstarter search for the iOS app icon book and you'll find it very quickly.
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.560]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.960]   Uh, really good solution.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.640]   I've been using my, my new iPad Pro a lot more over the past few months.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:54.920]   The only times where I haven't liked it are what times where I thought that I just wish
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:00.400]   that this, that Safari just worked like a desktop web browser and I've, I'll, part of
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.640]   that is complaining to Apple, but most of it is complaining to websites that just, if
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.560]   you just did nothing, if you just showed a webpage and let Safari and the built in stuff
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:15.120]   that's an iOS handle it, you would not be making me so frustrated right now.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:23.240]   So there's a $7.99 plug in on the, on the iOS store called Stop the Madness that all,
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.400]   this is exactly like the, exactly the right word for it.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.960]   All it really does is it strips away everything that websites do to screw up the experience
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:32.960]   artificially.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:37.760]   So like if you've ever been on a, like a, a page where it's like a long article, but
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.920]   they won't let you stretch to, to, to enlarge it because they blocked that or you can't
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:47.440]   like copy, copy something out of it because copying has been disabled or, or you can't
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.600]   use picture in picture because it, although it works with any video stream, they put something
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.520]   on top of it that makes it not work anymore.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.400]   All it does is basically defeats, defeats, defeats, defeats, defeats, defeats, all of
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.960]   this stuff that's being done in JavaScript to make sure that your experience on a mobile
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:04.960]   device absolutely stinks.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.040]   And there are a couple of secure, privacy and security features things, but for me,
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:13.240]   it really is just about, I want to be able to use picture in picture on this 48 minute
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.240]   video.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.360]   And I just want to, here is a piece of text.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.160]   I just want to copy it so I can use it someplace else.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:23.120]   And then when you paste it, you see, instead of saying, here's the, here's the, here's the
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:30.200]   in 2008, the Apple spent over $1800 on premium water on this one.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:36.000]   But instead of that text, like, set a source at the dot, dot, dot, for a, it's a promotion
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]   for the website.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000]   Here's where you got it from.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000]   Here's where, and here's other stuff that you can see about it.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.360]   Like, no, this is the text.
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.440]   All of this stuff is like, just don't interfere with what I'm explicitly asking you to do.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.600]   And you, you, Mr. website will be wonderful.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.280]   So this short circuits, all that sort of stuff.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.480]   I'm very, very happy to spend $799 for it.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.880]   They also have a version for desktop browsers that's available in the Mac App Store.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:59.680]   That's $999 for me.
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:04.200]   It's nice, but it's not as critical as, again, restoring basic functionality that allows
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:11.760]   me more power to use this really, really beautiful iPad as a replacement for what I would, can
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.560]   usually have taken a laptop to do.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.240]   So a very good $8 to spend.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:16.640]   And it's, it's constantly being updated.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.240]   The, what don't be scared when you go to the developer website.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:21.560]   It was like, it's HTML like 1.4.
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.560]   I swear to God.
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:25.600]   It's like, it looks, it looks so super sketchy though.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.760]   So you, you released this in 2006 and never updated it.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:30.120]   No, take a look at the update log.
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:33.320]   It is, it is getting regular updates for everything.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:36.160]   I think he's just a fan of simple.
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:37.400]   God bless him.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:38.400]   Go.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.400]   Uh, former.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.400]   You know, they make it to use Reddit as a website.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.800]   And so that's the, that's the other thing where it's like, if, if I wanted to use your
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.200]   app, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, whatever, I would be using your app right now.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:55.800]   Don't interrupt me by saying what I was sure, I should open this and, or, like, would you
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:59.160]   rather open, would you rather download it and install the Twitter app or even worse?
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.880]   Oh, I see that you have the Twitter app installed.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.920]   Therefore, I'm not going to open this as a link.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:07.640]   I'm going to open this inside the Twitter app where you can then not share it out with
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:08.640]   other places.
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:11.560]   The fact that the video has cut where it cuss words in it.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.120]   We're not going to let you watch it on the website.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.280]   You have to go to the app because there's cuss words in this YouTube video.
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:17.280]   Right.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.960]   It's like, oh, again, don't, but my, my, my, the one place where technology always gets
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:28.200]   me the most mad is where I'm finding myself saying to the app or the, the, the, the gadget
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:31.360]   or whatever, just do nothing.
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.600]   If you do nothing, but what I'm asking you to do, I will love your product.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:40.840]   But no, you have to decide, oh, I don't, I don't think this should be, I think this
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:44.040]   should be louder than it actually is or I think that I should, that this should actually
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:48.480]   have little pop ups on it that explain what the content is like, no, do nothing and you'd
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:49.480]   be perfect.
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:53.240]   Underpass app.com.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:54.920]   Jeff Johnson.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.520]   Stop the madness.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:59.040]   One of his many different tools.
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:02.240]   Probably, probably owes some money to Susan powder, but that's a joke that only Generation
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.440]   X and older would understand.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:06.760]   So thank you for that, Andy and I come.
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.000]   And now you're picking the link.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000]   Alex Lindsay.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.160]   So, so I have two picks.
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.240]   One, just a quick mention that Black Friday is a good time.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:20.760]   If you like waves, plugins, if you're an audio person, they're very cheap right now.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.760]   There is a subscription that happens a year from now.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:28.120]   So know that, but, but there is, but you can buy a lot of plugins very inexpensively.
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.600]   We've been talking a lot about it on office hours.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:34.600]   These VST plugins, is that what they're, I think they do AU plugins.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.360]   Yeah, that'll work with logic and lots of other things.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:40.680]   And there are many, they are many.
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:46.120]   Yeah, there are so many and I'm only getting six or eight of them.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.120]   So, so, but what happens is this is the best marketing ever.
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.640]   It goes, you buy, they're like 80% off or something like that.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:56.360]   And then you buy one and says the next one on top of the 80% off is 20% more off.
[01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:58.080]   And you're like, oh, I'll have another one.
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.880]   And then it goes, next one is 30% off.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.440]   Next one is 40% off.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:07.080]   So if you buy them as a group, you end up with, on top of the price, you end up with 50%
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.080]   off, whatever it is.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.640]   So it becomes a large collection of them that would normally cost a lot of money and it
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:12.640]   all costs very much.
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:17.160]   It's like a Mac, it's like the Mac, those big Mac sales, those comp, but just for audio
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:18.160]   plugins.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.960]   And so anyway, so check that out.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.760]   What I, what I, my pick for the week is what's called the studio.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.080]   I'll show it to you.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:26.080]   This is a studio technology.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:33.000]   This is a little bit geeky and expensive, but the studio technology's 205, which is right
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000]   here.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.640]   Let's see if I can cut to this.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:38.320]   So this is this is this is it right now.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.320]   These don't come with it.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.320]   These are the rocks.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:42.120]   My daughter paints for me.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:48.200]   Anyway, so, but she's, she's, she's very good at it.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.200]   She's just selling her rocks.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200]   I buy those rocks.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.200]   Let's do that.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.200]   I know.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:53.200]   I know.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.200]   See, yeah, there we go.
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:55.200]   The, those are the rocks that she puts in.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.200]   She's, she's.
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.200]   She's very good at it.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:03.400]   And so, so what it, what this is, it's basically a, it's kind of like a cough, but really
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.400]   high tech.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:11.680]   So the, so what you have here is, you can see I muted myself.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:12.880]   I can mute myself there.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:13.880]   That's fine.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:21.160]   But also if I had other channels that I was connected to over Dante, I can see when I push
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.520]   down, I disappear.
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:27.880]   It, if I want to talk back to somebody and go off air, it automatically shuts this one
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.880]   off.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:31.040]   And again, it's all over Dante.
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:36.160]   And you know, I have a control panel here that is, you know, what the gain looks like
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.920]   and what the main switch is going to do and what the talkbacks, which is going to do and
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.200]   what kind of operating mode and there's remote controls that can be done.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:47.320]   So it's really a, you know, a, a fully feature.
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:52.240]   This is kind of the broadcast level of your announcer console.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:55.680]   And this is a, this is a tiny one compared to some of the other ones I've owned.
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:59.840]   I wanted something that would fit on the desk and, and again, it uses Dante.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:03.040]   So it theoretically, if you have Dante virtual sound machine, it'll go straight into your
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.040]   computer.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:07.040]   The gain is a little low for at least for the high.
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:10.440]   So so you need to have, so I run it through something else to do that.
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:14.880]   And it'll do, and it'll do that with the main switch with analog.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:18.800]   So you could do analog through that and then have the talkbacks still turn that switch
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.040]   off when you touch them.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:24.680]   And we've been using these for a long time, a decade.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:29.240]   This is just my first personal one that it's got for the, got for my home, a little broadcast
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:30.240]   here.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.040]   Your home has Dante audio over ethernet and every room all throughout the house.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.560]   Not through the house, just from my office.
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:36.560]   I'm working on the house.
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.760]   I think that'd be kind of cool.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.640]   Well, I have a, I have a big plan.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:46.000]   I'm trying to, you know, my, my big plan is to get a BSS 806 to go into the, into the
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.080]   system with a bunch of crown amps.
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.360]   And then I can use the blue network to tie the ground amps in and then put Dante through
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.360]   the whole house.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.280]   And I can use little Bluetooth to Dante so you could just open up your phone and, you know,
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:58.960]   jump on the network or whatever.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:01.960]   And because I've got a lot of, it came with the house, but there's a lot of speakers
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.960]   in the house.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:08.720]   And so I think that, so this is basically ethernet for audio wiring, but could you, can you run
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:11.640]   a top of your internet, ethernet or do you have to have a separate net?
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640]   You have to have a separate net.
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:14.400]   No, you, it can, no, it doesn't have to.
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:15.480]   Here's the deal.
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:18.640]   For the most part for something like what I'm using it for, you can absolutely have it
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:20.840]   be just on its own.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.000]   You know, it's just fine.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.160]   We hardwired the whole house a couple of, about a year ago.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.440]   Be kind of, yeah, well, you put Dante over it.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:29.760]   Oh, yeah, it's great.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:34.480]   And the, the main thing is you do have to understand your network a little bit because
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:37.360]   there's some clocking issues that can occur and you have to have one piece of hardware
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.480]   that has the automate chips in them.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:42.520]   So if you just support software and almost anything you get will have that, any piece
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:43.520]   of hardware.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.080]   So they're like, this one will help it, you know, sync itself.
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:51.840]   And so, and I'm, and so yeah, so I, but I'm in my office, all the major going back and
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:54.000]   forth between stuff is all in Dante.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.880]   It's the only place I have to be out of Dante is when I go from the mic, you know, into
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:01.080]   this little thing and then everything else is all Dante.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.680]   So anyway, it's all mics in every room.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:09.240]   Well, that's your phone, you know, what I want to, in addition to your smart speakers,
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.240]   you mean?
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:11.240]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:15.560]   Well, the thing, the thing that, well, I have, they're all dumb speakers on my end, but
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:19.080]   they're, but if I can make them smart through this kind of hub, I've even been thinking
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.400]   about security where you have, if you had motion detectors, you could have it sound
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.520]   like there's a dog always in the other room.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:30.320]   You could hear that, you could hear the little pause going across the, the, the, the, you
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.360]   know, and then you could have, you could have like speakers upstairs going, honey, where's
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]   your shotgun?
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360]   Where's your chicken?
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.200]   It's like, you know, and then you hear this little, this little woman just go doing the
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.920]   chest one and they're doing the chest.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.440]   You know, you hear the, you hear the, you can do all of those things.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.040]   You put all those things in your house and someone broke in and they, you just have to
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:51.680]   be like a home alone, except with Dante.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:55.680]   And it all starts with the Model 205 Announcer's Console.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:59.120]   It's a studio technologies incorporated.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:00.120]   Exactly.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:05.400]   You'll get to know all kinds of members of your local police tactical enforcement teams.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.400]   Exactly.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.680]   You're having an open house.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:12.720]   We're using, we're using audio and, and, and, and, you know, it's, it's, it's a, it's
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:16.680]   a kind gentle gentle way to, no, no one's hurt.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:18.680]   Exactly.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:24.400]   Uh, actually I want to credit Scooter X for my pick of the week, this week he told me
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.680]   about the brand new indie go-go for hyper.
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.760]   I've bought a lot of hyper extensions.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:40.960]   This is their triple 4K display dock for MacBook Pro featuring 15 count them USB C ports plus
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:45.160]   support for triple 4K by 60 Hertz extended displays.
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:50.120]   It even works with older MacBooks, but I bet it would work really well with my M1 X.
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:51.120]   Much power Leo.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:52.640]   It's going to corrupt you.
[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:54.640]   149 bucks.
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:59.200]   I'm not necessarily recommending it, although I have bought and I threw in the go-go because
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.120]   this is how hyper does their products.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.600]   They have had 18 campaigns.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:06.320]   I've bought a number of dongles from Hyper ebb and very happy with this one.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.040]   Sounds pretty awesome.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.560]   I need 15 USB C ports.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:12.600]   I need it.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.800]   Just for your microphones.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:14.800]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:19.280]   Just yeah, Dante over USB C. Now we're going to it's got a VGA.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.280]   You could have cameras like like Walgreens.
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.280]   That could be like Walgreens.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.840]   There you go.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.840]   Live the dream.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:30.560]   Build a huge platform like the pharmacist.
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.160]   So many connections.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:33.920]   So many connections.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:34.920]   So many connections.
[02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.960]   Driverless triple 4K.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:39.360]   15 connective ports.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.080]   Three of them are never not going to work and drive you nuts simultaneously.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:46.080]   A lot of these are decorative, but it's all about the flex.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:47.800]   It's not about the actual function.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:50.480]   Oh, and then if you snap on, there's nothing behind them.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:56.520]   Then they have an additional snap on magnetic hub for triple display port for the modern
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.520]   max.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.160]   So I mean, you're talking.
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.720]   Look at that.
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:03.240]   You're just you're golden here.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.240]   Yeah.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:05.240]   Okay.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.240]   This is just out of control.
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:08.520]   All right.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:09.520]   We are done.
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.040]   Renee Richie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.440]   Anything exciting you're working on?
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.160]   Of course, there is.
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.560]   I'm working on my deep dive on the M1 Pro and the M1 Max and Apple scalable architecture.
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.400]   That's going to be my next big project.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.600]   That is a project.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:26.520]   Quite a project.
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:29.040]   All here, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:34.200]   See, you're not doing the this.
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:35.200]   I like it.
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.560]   The reactions are toned down a little bit now.
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:38.600]   It's just your nice smile.
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:42.000]   You know, it's funny because everyone says like, I can't take these reactions.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.720]   And then I try one with like a very.
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:44.720]   I know they work better.
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:47.680]   And then I switch it back and it's like a million people.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.560]   I'm like, you people read the tabloids.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:53.000]   You're just you just say that you listen to NPR, but you read the tabloids.
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000]   Absolutely.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.760]   I mean, there's a reason why all these videos have crazy expressions on them.
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:02.280]   What's that thread that Netflix thread that they that they went through to show how Netflix
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:06.600]   uses machine learning to pick the and there's like facial expressions, like the more emotional
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:08.680]   facial expressions, one or two people.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:09.680]   It's humans.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:11.840]   You think it's humans doing this though, this time, right?
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:15.640]   It's like, actually on Apple talk last week, Georgia and I went through the entire thread
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:19.880]   and she explained the psychology of why these sorts of thumbnails work, like everything
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.640]   that we react to that all these years of evolution have trained us to react to.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:28.640]   And they're just like, and they like Netflix will say villains get more clicks than heroes
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:33.280]   and big facial expressions and which colors and if you watch, you know, more rom coms,
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.120]   I'll show you like a fuzzy earth thumbnail.
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.120]   If you watch more action, I'll show you more violence.
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.880]   Like it's a science Leo, it's not even art anymore.
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:42.600]   This is really the king of this line is tech tips.
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:44.840]   He's everyone is like grimace.
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.400]   Almost as good at facial expressions as he is sponsor.
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:50.400]   I said, wait, it's just grimacing grimacing.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:55.200]   Andy and I go, what are you going to be in GBH next Friday?
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:01.640]   As usual, 1230 and the afternoon, just go to wgph news.org to stream it live or come
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.960]   back to the website later that night to stream it later.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:05.960]   Nice.
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.040]   And not co.com.
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.400]   Are you working in your projects?
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:11.280]   Are you getting close?
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.280]   Getting close.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:17.640]   The pipeline is still being filled and as usual, as usual, I wish that I could take a
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:19.360]   pill to fix this about me.
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:22.840]   It's like, but I don't want the header to look like that.
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:24.840]   How do I fix that?
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.880]   And I also, and I also don't want it for some stupid reason, don't want to spend a couple
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:32.120]   thousand dollars to simply have as someone who knows what they're doing, get received.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:34.200]   I napkin that says, here's what I wanted to look like.
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:35.880]   And then they do it.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.960]   It's a little bit nice enough to volunteer it, but I feel very adamant that I should be paying
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.880]   people for that kind of work.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:45.120]   It's my mental hang up that look, it's just release it and then fix it later.
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:47.120]   But yeah, so I don't have a date.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:52.000]   I'll announce a date once I feel as though I'm ready to open the tabs, but I'm pretty
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000]   excited.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.200]   I think the people who have been saying, oh, I miss your writing on a regular basis.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:00.760]   Someone on Twitter said, you have, as part of a complaint, which is one of the nicest,
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:05.200]   most nicely put across complaints is that I just, I wish that you would, I've said that
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:07.600]   like in your newspaper column or something like that.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.600]   I've missed that too.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.880]   I, this is all a point of I want to create something where I don't have to ask any permission.
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.240]   I don't have to do anything.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.840]   I can just do it just like that.
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:20.320]   I just want to point out Eastern Orthodox Christmas is January 7th this year.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.320]   That would be a very good time to launch a website.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.320]   I'm just saying.
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:27.360]   I have, actually, it'll be appropriate because I've used that excuse for ships for setting
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:28.720]   up my Christmas cards late.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:34.920]   It's like, well, happy, happy, happy, happy Orthodox Christmas because I'm not cool.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:35.920]   We do.
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:38.400]   At my household, we did celebrate like both Easter's and both Christmas.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.840]   So I have, I have, I have my, I have my little like fingertips grasping on the edge of that
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.840]   clip of credibility.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:44.840]   And Canadian Thanksgiving.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:49.080]   I think you should announce it'll be out for Christmas and that gives you all the way
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:50.320]   to January 7th.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.320]   So it's perfect.
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.800]   You get an extra, I could be like Apple saying, I'll say, which Christmas.
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:55.800]   Q one.
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:56.800]   Q one.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:57.800]   Q one.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:58.800]   You figure out if it's in 2022.
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.760]   It's all, you know, it's all in the air there.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:06.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, 090.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:08.160]   Media is his day job.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:11.680]   Actually his 24 hour job is office hours at office hours.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:12.920]   Other people, other people managed out.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:15.040]   My day job's still the O'Dine Ooh.
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.640]   But, but there's, but there's lots of people there 24/7 in office hours and after hours.
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:25.240]   After hours is what runs 21 hours a day and then office hours runs three.
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:29.120]   We've got AJA coming in tomorrow at the Ooh, they're bridge live.
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.200]   So they're going to be in here doing a walk through and answering people's questions.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.680]   And we have Parsec on Friday.
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:39.160]   So they're going to talk about, you know, how their software works, you know, for screen
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.160]   mirroring.
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.880]   And Thursday we're talking about how our office hours 2.0 kind of our broadcast version of
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:49.800]   what we're doing with office hours is going.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.280]   And then of course, education, cooking and concerts on Saturday.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.080]   So long dead.
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:56.200]   Education, cooking and concerts.
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:02.080]   I'm increasingly referring people like you have a whole show on Monday yesterday on building
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.480]   kits for live streaming.
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.840]   People are always asking me on the radio show, you know, for churches and so forth.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:12.920]   I'm increasingly referring people to these, you know, really great and geeky discussion
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.640]   about kits for live streaming.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:19.560]   And then today we spent an hour talking about nixers, just the different analog versus digital
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:22.320]   and what you get for them and how they work.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:23.320]   And mostly it's just Q&A.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:24.320]   We're just answering people's questions.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:30.520]   So if you have questions to ask there, it's a great platform to do it.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.520]   Office hours.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:32.520]   Global.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.520]   Thank you everybody.

[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:00.960]   which mashed potato says Georgia's reaction photos are even better than yours.
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:01.960]   Renee, it's true.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:03.200]   Georgia really gets into it.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:05.320]   She definitely does.
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:06.320]   Yep.

[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:19.400]   I hear somebody's Android phone ringing.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:23.360]   So I think it's time to say good night.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:26.200]   Time to blow out the candle.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:27.200]   Oh, no.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:28.200]   Oh, boy.
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:29.200]   Don't get that.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.680]   Sorry about that.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:32.920]   It's time to say goodbye.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:33.920]   What does this smell?
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:34.920]   It's smitten.
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.280]   I've been smitten by Hot Wax.
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.920]   We'll see you next time now.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:44.160]   Come back to work because break time is out over the fight.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:49.120]   Do you have an iPhone, an Apple watch, an iPad or any number of Apple devices?
