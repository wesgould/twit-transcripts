[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.760]   This is MacBrige Weekly, episode 21 for the week
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   of December 25, 2006.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.800]   Too much chocolate.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:47.640]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.520]   This is Alex Lindsey.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   And we are back for another week of MacBrige Weekly.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.560]   Is that what we're doing today?
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.000]   Yeah, we're doing MacBrige Weekly today.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.920]   We are doing MacBrige Weekly today.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.680]   Excellent.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.080]   We did this week in media this morning,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.040]   so I have to keep track of which one is which.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.160]   You should get a big whiteboard.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000]   Yes.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.280]   You are doing MacBrige Weekly.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.320]   You are doing visual VFX show.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.840]   You are doing-- we just added in the Pixel core,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.960]   we added 60 producers, people who are training to be producers
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   and we're organizing everything else.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.800]   And so soon I will really truly have to put something
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.960]   up on the wall.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.640]   As you may have guessed, Merlin Mann is back.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.360]   Hello.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.680]   Merlin looks so different.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.000]   I know you guys are just listening to him.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.360]   Merlin, he probably sounds pretty dope.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.680]   Say something else, Merlin.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.480]   Hello.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.760]   Well, the problem is, Alex, I was looking
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.240]   like a kind of a Sasquatch, a Yeti.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.840]   The locks were getting a little long.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.680]   Yeah, I wasn't sure where I was going with that.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.760]   I didn't really have a trajectory that I was satisfied with.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.520]   So I think you did not--
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.040]   Where did he get your haircut, Alex?
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.120]   I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.600]   No.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.320]   I actually get my haircut at a nice salon.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.040]   Oh, really?
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.720]   Yeah, it started off as--
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480]   here's the deal is it started off as a--
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   Paying a lot for that haircut, Alex?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800]   The one I have-- you got to get--
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.360]   he's looking at me.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.640]   I got a baseball hat on right now.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.080]   So yes, I do.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.040]   I-- the gym that I work out in and the place
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.200]   that I get my haircut happens to be right next to the office.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.080]   So it doesn't have a lot to do with how much it costs
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.680]   or how snooty it is.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.120]   It just has to do with it is less than a block from where
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.720]   I'm working, so I don't have to think about it.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.480]   And so I paint an incredible amount for my gym.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080]   Just because if I pay-- if it's four blocks away or five
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.160]   blocks away, I won't go.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.680]   I'm just telling you, man, you walk up two blocks.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.120]   You walk up to Montgomery.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.520]   Go to Montgomery and market.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.400]   Go to the arcade.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.320]   Go to Joey.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.080]   Joey will set you up with a $20 haircut.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.160]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.720]   Like across the street from Stacey's by--
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.320]   go over there?
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.480]   Get a $20 haircut.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.800]   That's a $20 haircut.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.600]   It's very nice.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   It's very nice.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.240]   But it's very nice to be here.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.160]   And I--
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.640]   And Merlin's glasses.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.840]   He has no glasses on her.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.160]   Yeah, you're all very fuzzy to me right now.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.840]   Are you just walking around fuzziness?
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.880]   You know what?
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.360]   My-- what is it?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.640]   An optometrist is that the person--
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.520]   we are so already down a rattle.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   And we're rolling like 30 seconds in.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.520]   That's fine.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.020]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.280]   The glasses help a little bit, not a lot.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   I think I mainly have muscular eye strain
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.840]   from the computer screen and whatnot.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   Oh, see, I'm blind without the mic.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.480]   Are you really?
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.080]   Genetically, if I don't wear my glasses,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.640]   I pretty much can't get out of the office.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   You were a basket case without a series of technologies
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.120]   to buttress you up.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.640]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.360]   If we weren't living in this day and age,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.840]   I'd be like sitting in the back of some room, just waiting
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.680]   for people to give me food.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.920]   We also have here--
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   we have-- now I want to get this right--
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.600]   Dan Dilger.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.240]   Dilger, right.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.120]   Dilger.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.600]   I thought I was going to hit it right on.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.520]   I just had it, yeah.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.600]   Dilger.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560]   Dan-- and a lot of you will know if you go up to the web,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.720]   you're going to think of Dan Eran.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.640]   Is it Eran?
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.600]   Well, Daniel Aaron is my first name.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.680]   Aaron, my first name.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.920]   I just like-- and you've got to get--
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   I'm notorious for this.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.760]   I don't get anybody's name correct for the first time.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.200]   In fact, you'll have to be on for a couple of shows
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.280]   before I really hit it right on.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.120]   And it took me most of the season
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   to get Kenji's last name pronounced correctly.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120]   But Dan has an excellent, excellent website
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.640]   called Roughly Drafted.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   And you're slowly moving towards really having a magazine.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.080]   I mean, you really put out a lot of stuff.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.640]   How often do you put stuff out here?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.560]   On average, I tend to post something once every other day.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.760]   But yeah, it's hard to maintain.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280]   And one of the things that I really
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.000]   like about Dan's website is that it's something that--
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.160]   it does definitely-- you feel like you really thought it out.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.520]   You know, unlike me, who mostly just talks out my butt.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.000]   I mean, Merlin, me and Merlin just kind of say whatever we think.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.080]   Dan's input actually is well thought out.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.480]   And so we thought it would be fun to have him on the show
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.640]   for this holiday season.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.280]   Well, thanks.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.080]   I get kind of obsessive I start editing.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   And I spend a lot of time on an article.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.320]   And then we finally get it up.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.880]   And then I have to put up another one afterwards.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.560]   So it's kind of a addiction.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.960]   I mostly have to have someone read through mine
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.760]   to make sure that it's actually readable.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.400]   I'm horrible dyslexia.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   So every time you get an email from me,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.120]   it requires like four or five passes
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.280]   before it's actually readable.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.080]   The first pass is just a cardboard.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.120]   That's why there's a short.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.320]   I always wonder, your emails are weird.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.040]   That's why they're short.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.600]   Very short emails because I have to proofread every email.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.960]   Fewer chances for typos.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.760]   Exactly.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.400]   That's so hard.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.360]   So that's why I do it because it really does.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.920]   It's very painful for me to write an email.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.520]   And which is funny when I read for magazines
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.440]   because it's really painful.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.760]   So anyway, we've got a bunch of news.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.160]   We've got lots of fun stuff coming up here
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.280]   before we get into the news though
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.760]   because I know some people won't make it
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.600]   to the end of the show.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.160]   I want to make sure that people know what's going on.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.800]   We've got Mackerel coming up.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.640]   Mackerel's going to be a big, big show for us.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.480]   Couple things.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.720]   One is, if you haven't subscribed to Mac,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.680]   break the video you want to do it
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   because Macbreak is going to be putting out updates.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.520]   Probably almost every day that we come back world.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   Really showing different stuff that's going on,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.520]   covering the Expo floor, talking to people,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.360]   and so on.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.200]   There's a bunch of events going on.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.040]   Also, your favorite Macbreak guys
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.720]   will be at the Apple Store 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.160]   And then so that's going to be the Tuesday
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.040]   after the keynote, Leo and Merlin and myself.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.160]   It's Tuesday or Monday?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.080]   It is Tuesday.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.800]   Definitely Tuesday because we had Monday last time.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.640]   No, it's Tuesday night.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.400]   Tuesday and that's Tuesday the ninth.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   At 6 p.m. at the Apple Store.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   And we're going to talk about whatever Steve talked about.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   So we're going to talk about what Steve talked about.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   And then we're going to go to the 21st Amendment
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   at seven o'clock, seven, seven, 30.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   And we're going to tie some on.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   So anyway, so it's going to be a great evening.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   So we're hoping that a lot of people will join us.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   On Wednesday night, there is the Final Cut Pro user group
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   over at the mezzanine, which is usually pretty good.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   It's about 10 bucks.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   The one at the Apple Store is free.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.600]   10 bucks for the mezzanine, but it's gotten a lot of great Apple
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   folks and great editors and so on and so forth,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   talking on one Wednesday night.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.120]   On Thursday, there's a broadcaster, Mac podcaster, Adam
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.000]   Christensen, and a whole bunch of other guys are doing one
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   at the Apple Store again at 6 p.m.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.120]   And then they're going to have it get together right afterwards
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.400]   at the Metreon in Jillian.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.200]   Are you going to that?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.700]   I'm going.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.400]   I'm going to.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.600]   I think we're going to try to record it.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.880]   So that'll be part of some of the stuff that we're doing
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.400]   that week.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.100]   So I'm going, Merlin's going, Dan might be going.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.800]   I'm going to be in the Virgin Islands.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.600]   Dan's not going at all.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Dan is not going.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.100]   How could you?
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.920]   How could you be going to the Virgin Islands
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.200]   in the middle of Macworld?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.000]   How could that happen?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.360]   Well, I'm going to be going Wednesday Wednesday night.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   So I'll be there for a couple days.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.200]   OK.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.700]   OK.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.200]   OK.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   We'll just drop it.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.800]   We'll just drop the whole thing.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.840]   So anyway, those are the things that are going on right now
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.440]   at Macworld.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.280]   You definitely want to stay tuned for that.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   And I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.520]   How do you wangle that?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.080]   How do I worry?
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.840]   How do you wangle getting us into the Apple Store on Steve
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.600]   Day?
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.680]   I actually have spoken for a while.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.400]   I was at the Apple Store.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.800]   I was at the Apple Store probably almost every week,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.480]   or someone from the Pixel Court was.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.000]   So we've got a pretty good Travis and the boys.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.880]   So we know those guys pretty well over there.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.080]   And so I was just over chatting with Travis.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.040]   And he asked if we wanted to come over.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.000]   The key with them is to talk to Apple.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.720]   The Apple Store.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.520]   Have something useful.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.760]   Have Leo is the key number one.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.360]   Have Leo in your show number one.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.400]   Number two, talk to the Apple Store six months
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.880]   before the actual event.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.320]   And it's hard to get both of those in the same place
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   at the same time.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:14.680]   And so--
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.120]   That'd be fun.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.680]   It will be a mob.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.200]   If it's starting at 6 PM, if you want a seat,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.920]   I would highly suggest showing up at 5.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.840]   Just so you know, it's going to be typically when Leo shows up
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.920]   at the Apple Store, it is a hectic time.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.320]   I want to sit there one time.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.400]   You guys were shooting Twit there.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.560]   And it was out of control.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.280]   So if you want-- as I said, if you want to seat,
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.320]   there's only 35 seats.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.200]   And there's going to be two or 300 people there,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.360]   is my guess.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   But it's a lot of fun.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.480]   And even if you're standing and hanging out,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.800]   and so on and so forth, it's really worth going.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.080]   It's just a great communal event, no matter how much you hear
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.160]   or see or whatever.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.520]   And I'm trying to work out some ways that people further back
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.120]   and hear us and so on and so forth.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.920]   And we're going to have people interacting and chatting with us.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.360]   So I think we're going to have a lot of great folks
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.840]   floating around in the crowd.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.200]   I know we've invited much people.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.360]   I don't want to say who.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.800]   But I think it'll be a really good evening.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.840]   So definitely check it out.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.200]   So we've got all kinds of news.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.240]   What, Merlin, what is the big news of the week?
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   I'm throwing--
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.680]   I figured I'd throw Merlin the--
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.160]   Oh, man.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.200]   Well, you were writing it all down before the show.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.480]   I figured I'd--
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.680]   This is purely for my own.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.760]   This is purely because of the deficits in my mind
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.960]   that I've written these down.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.040]   This is not any kind of an agenda.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.600]   Well, I'm going to throw it a damn.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.120]   Because I-- we shouldn't start with Vista,
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.080]   because it's a Mac show.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.040]   That would be a letdown.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.640]   Oh, let's start with Vista.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.200]   Let's get it over with.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.520]   There's a fellow who's written a technical fellow who's
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.520]   written a very long 6,000 word--
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   --explocation.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.840]   Who is this fellow?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.720]   With his thoughts.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.840]   Dan, tell us about this fellow.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.080]   This is a guy who wrote this long post about Vista.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.960]   Basically, I want to remember the exact quote was that it's--
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.920]   when you say it was the longest suicide note in tech history.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:08.040]   But the problems that he saw in Vista DRM and Interoperability,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.920]   you were at up on that, didn't you?
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.840]   Yeah, I think the guy that wrote it
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.040]   had some connection with medical imaging.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.440]   And--
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.800]   To who is this fellow?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.520]   Do we know?
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.440]   I was looking it up here.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.800]   I was trying to see if I could find it.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.600]   But he's from-- is it the Australia?
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.800]   I can remember as the URL had CS in it.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.600]   Everyone just--
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.960]   Everyone just came from--
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.440]   --there he is.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   There we go.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   It's quieter.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.560]   It's OK.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.400]   I will put it in the show notes.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.480]   It is www.cs.auklin.ac.nz.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.080]   And then it's got a whole bunch of stuff on the end.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.200]   But it's Peter Gutman.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.800]   Put this up.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.920]   And he's got an executive summary.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.560]   The title of it is a cost analysis of Windows Vista
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.160]   content protection.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.080]   Do you want to read the executive executive summary?
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.560]   OK, I'll read you the executive summary.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.600]   So then you get an idea of what we're talking about here.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.240]   Windows Vista includes an extensive reworking of core OS
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.880]   elements in order to provide content production
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.200]   for so-called premium content.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.960]   Typically, HD data from Blu-ray and HD DVD sources.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.800]   Providing this protection incurs considerable costs
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.200]   in terms of system performance, system stability,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   technical support, overhead, and hardware and software costs.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.640]   These issues affect not only users of Vista,
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.480]   but the entire PC industry.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.840]   Since the effects of the protection measures
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.360]   extend to cover all hardware and software that
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.840]   will ever come into contact with Vista,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.040]   even if it's not used directly with Vista,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.920]   for example, hardware in the Macintosh computer
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.720]   or on a Linux server.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.000]   This document analyzes the cost involved
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.320]   in Vista's content protection and the collateral damage
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.480]   that this incurs throughout the computer industry.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.680]   I've never seen that text.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.720]   I was really scared that I was going to make it through.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.320]   So that's the executive summary that
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.720]   gives you a sense of what he's talking about.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.400]   And it's--
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.000]   It's something that people-- it's related to something
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.200]   that people have been talking about for a while, which is that--
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.120]   and granted, it's a Mac show we're talking here.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.480]   But now with the ability to run Windows so easily on your Mac,
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.440]   increasingly the issues that had only
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.320]   been the domain of PCs or are going
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.160]   to become problems or challenges or opportunities
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.760]   for Mac users as well.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.840]   It is and is also when we really look at the business model
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.400]   of where Apple's going and Apple's possible growth.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.680]   I think this is why this is important for Mac break
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.080]   is that if Windows makes it very difficult and painful to use
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.320]   and affects bunches up the whole system,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.240]   I think that affects Apple in a positive way.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:44.960]   Dan?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.000]   Well, there's two things.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.400]   The topic that he's covering relates to Blu-ray and HD DVD
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.600]   and high-end video that the industry is paranoid
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.200]   about people copying.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.360]   And it's kind of an extension of what we already have with DVD.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.240]   If anyone, including Apple, who puts a DVD player
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.320]   in the computer, asks to agree to certain things,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.840]   you can't-- like the region encoding,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.240]   Apple can't let you just change the region encoding
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.800]   any number of times you want.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.920]   They have to meet the industry.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.520]   Which I think is a limit of like five.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.600]   Five times, something like that.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.840]   And then it's not supposed to change anymore.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.400]   So those are things put in place by the DVD consortium.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.840]   And so Microsoft is kind of doing the same thing
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.960]   with Vista.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.240]   And a lot of things they're doing are very similar
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.480]   to the things they did before with Windows Media Player
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.840]   and plays for sure.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.920]   And basically, the things he's covering in this article
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.160]   pertain to if you have a Blu-ray player in your computer,
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.600]   Vista, and managing that high-resolution video
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.760]   won't allow it to play out through any device
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.600]   that you could--
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.880]   is designed so you can't play super high-definition video
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.120]   out through a regular video port and record it
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   and burn it to a regular DVD.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.880]   Which I guess, HDMI, the code-activated HDMI,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.160]   is supposed to have copper protection built into it.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.520]   So there's a way to really slow that.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.480]   They can slow that down through that process
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.680]   as long as everybody plays along.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.200]   Right.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.560]   So Vista isn't inventing anything terribly new.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.600]   It's like you say, it's a combination of hardware things
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.800]   that are already in place.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.560]   And they're just kind of extending that.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   And so it does kind of play into everyone,
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.880]   whether it's Windows computers or Apple's computers.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.160]   But Windows definitely does some--
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.360]   the things he addresses here refer specifically
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.120]   to drivers and things like that.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.800]   And how Microsoft, rather, is trying
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.920]   to kind of herd the industry in doing what Apple does all
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.640]   by itself.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.200]   Well, and I think that this gets back into--
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.080]   and we've talked about this a couple of times in the show,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.920]   so I won't belabor it.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.080]   But this really gets to who each company caters to.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.840]   And I really believe that Microsoft really
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.200]   caters to the industry.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.960]   So they cater to the MPAA.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.000]   They cater to the Hollywood power structure,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.920]   while Apple is mostly worried about--
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.080]   what do we have to add?
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   They're mostly worried about the consumer.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.480]   And how do we make sure that the consumer gets what they want?
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.480]   And we'll only add what we absolutely
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   have to to get--
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.000]   we constantly want to minimize the impact of DRM
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.920]   on the consumer.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.080]   And I don't think that that's Microsoft's focus.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.160]   What does this mean to the Garden Variety Mac user who's
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.400]   running Windows on their Mac machine?
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.640]   So one of the things I've seen a commenter on Metafilter,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.880]   it's Arkan, JG, is talking about how it can--
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.880]   one of the things it can do is force the HD to down sample
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.360]   to 480p if everything's not lining up all the way down,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.000]   if all of the--
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.360]   I think the bottom line is it's going
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.240]   to be a lot easier to watch your Blu-ray on the Mac
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.280]   side of your computer than it is on the Windows
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.760]   side of your computer.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.840]   I think if you're going to--
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.440]   for us, for those of us who have a choice,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.640]   we're using Vista.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.040]   I think we're going to most likely not
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.160]   be using Vista as our format for watching movies.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.920]   Well, one thing I was just curious about--
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.480]   and this goes straight into the talking out of my butt area.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.200]   But so one thing I'm curious about, though,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.680]   is you're running--
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.480]   when you're running something like parallels
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.280]   or whatever you're running, there's
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.160]   some kind of an emulation going on.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.560]   Does running Vista on a Mac make it in any way more
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.600]   hackable to get around any of this stuff than it would be
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.720]   to run it on a PC?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.560]   Since there's something--
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.160]   Not on the Mac side.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.760]   Not on the Mac side.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.120]   Really?
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's the same thing in terms of--
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.240]   it's even though it's emulating, in some cases,
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   different pieces of hardware and software.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.640]   It'll-- if you get a virus or you get messed up or whatever,
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.720]   it'll trash the volume that parallels is using.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.680]   But it's not going to leak over to your Mac side.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   Not that I know of.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.280]   I don't think that's really an issue.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.440]   But I do think that it is something
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.280]   that is important for people to pay attention to.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.880]   I don't know when I'm playing.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.520]   I mean, I have Windows on my MacBook Pro or whatever.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.120]   But I don't have any intention of going to Vista anytime soon.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.440]   I think Leo may have already done it.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.720]   I think Leo likes to stay on the edge of that.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.000]   Unless there's something really necessary for me
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.120]   to move over, I'm not going to.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.440]   And I think you're running Windows on a Mac, Dan?
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.880]   I've used XP.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.120]   Are you running it on your Mac?
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.240]   Are you running it on a PC?
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.200]   I've used chair levels, and I've also
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.800]   used bootcamp to run it directly.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.000]   And I have XP running on a PC computer as well.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And so I don't-- and we're not alone.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.640]   I mean, three quarters of the PC users aren't planning
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.440]   to upgrade to Vista next year.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.360]   I really think that while this article was talking
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.680]   about this being a long suicide note by Microsoft,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.480]   I think I truly think Vista is the last OS that Microsoft will
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   ever write.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.280]   I think it may continue to update it.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.120]   It may update it for the next five to 10 years,
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.360]   but I don't think that they're going to--
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.680]   I think it's-- the age of the OS is nearing its end.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.160]   They've got an enormous amount of spaghetti code.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.680]   They can't really change it.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.240]   They can't-- I mean, their best option
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.680]   is to further develop the Xbox.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.040]   You know what?
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.760]   But I don't think we're going to see another--
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.600]   I don't think we're going to see it.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   I don't think we're going to see another operation.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.040]   We have still a conversation about OS 10 not too long ago.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.680]   And whether they'll get to a point,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.400]   like, is there-- what's going to come after the next relationship?
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.480]   Well, and Apple has already said that they're
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.240]   going to slow down the rollout of OS's after they get--
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.440]   they've already said that they're there.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.240]   And they already have.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.600]   We're not seeing them quite as fast as they used to come out.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.000]   But I think that they've gotten to a point where they're happy
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.880]   and now they want to just kind of solve a lot of the major
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.880]   issues.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.600]   So I think more every day, there's things
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.440]   that I want them to take out of OS 10 than put in.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:51.960]   Really?
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.800]   And you'd like to see those kind of shunted off
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.120]   into other products?
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.960]   I just want to--
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.520]   Like the dock.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   We're back to the dock.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.920]   We're back to the darn dock.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.440]   Alex has a problem with his dock.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.240]   He doesn't like his dock.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.600]   The dock.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.880]   But just so nothing.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.040]   I mean, I guess, again, we're probably just
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.240]   shooting fish in a barrel here.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.720]   But so is anything that the Mac user running Windows
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.800]   needs to pull away from this article?
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.600]   Yeah, don't get missed.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.480]   Oh, and beyond that, you may kind of
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:26.560]   interesting comment about the idea of hardware lockdowns
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.640]   and how it kind of affects everyone.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.360]   Reading that kind of reminded me of what
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.240]   happened in the '90s with audio.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.040]   Remember that Sony came out with a mini disk.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.400]   And there were all these efforts to come out
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.520]   with a new thing that would replace the cassette and the LP.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.000]   And nothing really did.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.120]   And the reason it didn't was because DRM was so
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.160]   generous on it that it really prevented those products
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.680]   from working.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.600]   Well, and you look at the PSP, which should have done really,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.160]   really well.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.120]   I mean, it's done well.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.240]   It's done OK, but it's dropping off quickly.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.120]   And it really could have owned the market.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.760]   It came out.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.840]   It's a better video platform in many ways
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.480]   than the video iPod.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.960]   It could have done all those things.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.040]   But Sony's obsession with keeping it so locked down
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.480]   and so hard to get movies onto it.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.280]   And so difficult to work all that stuff.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.920]   And rather than making it part of just--
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.640]   you could do it any way you want.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.080]   I think is a big thing that really stifled it.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.720]   Would you agree?
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   And then in kind of a parallel with that with the iPod
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.320]   and what Microsoft was doing at the Play Store Share,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.440]   the iPod was open.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.520]   And that's one of the things that people liked about is they
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.200]   didn't have to-- there was no expectation
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.160]   that people would go to some store and buy all their music
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.000]   from it.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.920]   Whereas with the Play Store Share, the whole idea of it
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.560]   was that you're buying a device and then it
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.400]   was going to hook into a subscription model
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.480]   and you're going to pay an ongoing fee to have music.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.280]   Something that people had never really done before
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.240]   is like paying for the radio.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.840]   So Microsoft and its partners charted out this whole thing
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.040]   of how the world is just going to run in and pay for this.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.040]   Which is like, the Holy Grail for the RIA and the MPAA is just--
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.280]   everyone's just going to rent their music.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.080]   They're never going to buy it again.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.760]   And the problem is consumers just didn't get sold on it.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.960]   But there was this whole forward plan
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.320]   of how everyone's going to pay for it.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.280]   It just didn't happen.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.320]   And that may happen in kind of a similar way
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.920]   with these high definition formats
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.040]   like Blu-ray and HDDVD that are competing
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.640]   to kind of replace the DVD.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.280]   And it was just in the news recently that VHS has just now
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.400]   been in close by DVD.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.840]   It was just in the last couple of days they mentioned
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.400]   that the percentage of households that have VHS.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.840]   You're the only-- only now?
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.200]   I know.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.800]   That's really--
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.680]   We're in San Francisco.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.880]   I think in San Francisco it happened a long time ago.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.240]   But--
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.760]   I just think in terms of media, you just
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.360]   don't see the opportunity to buy--
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.200]   you don't see VHS.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.040]   I've seen it in truck stops.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.480]   That truck.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.160]   I see cassettes at truck stops too.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.880]   No, that's your part of the problem.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.320]   So but yeah, no, it's a pretty rare thing to see now.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.920]   And the big question, though, that I have that gets
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.800]   into this whole-- is DRM not only--
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.440]   we're talking about Vista here, but does DRM really
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.440]   have-- is it going to kill off the Blu-ray and the HDDVD?
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.560]   Because you're getting into this point where it's--
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.200]   Azure-ious released Zudio, which--
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.400]   have you played with Zudio at all?
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:13.800]   No, I haven't.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   It's their BitTorrent.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.560]   It's their BitTorrent.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.920]   It's like their for-profit BitTorrent.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.000]   It sits on top of Azure-ious.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.920]   And it's this huge BitTorrent engine that lets you do HD.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.960]   And so the BBC is partnering with him.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.640]   And then you have the Democracy player.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.680]   And the Democracy player lets you bring down HD.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.160]   Now, Mark Cuban has said that this is never
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.400]   going to go anywhere.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.320]   The TV is going to blow away internet video.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.760]   But the question is, is that--
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.000]   by the end-- and we talked a little bit about this on Twitch,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.920]   so I'm not going to get into it.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.880]   But the question is, is it--
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.480]   or any of these DRMs, are all of them
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.200]   going to slowly just kill off these formats where we end up
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.800]   just downloading stuff from iTunes?
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.840]   Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of options
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.280]   that could certainly replace having a new HD optical disc
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.520]   format and just never have it take place.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.680]   I mean, it doesn't have to be killed.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.080]   It just might never take hold.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.520]   Right, because right now the PS3 is getting walloped by the Wii.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.120]   It's really not getting the kind of bandwidth it's--
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.800]   The thing you mentioned that Mark Cuban thing just seems
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.560]   kind of interesting to me.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.440]   He's got a vested interest in his opinion.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.600]   Well, I just-- it's funny.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.640]   In the same way that voicemail didn't go away
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.960]   when we got email and meetings didn't go away
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.480]   when we got Skype.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.520]   Now we're talking here about my kind of my field.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.600]   But I mean, some of these technologies,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.360]   they're just-- I mean, there's something
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.960]   that has really, for example, look at, for example, YouTube.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.600]   YouTube, in terms of quality, the quality of a YouTube video
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.800]   is not high.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.400]   But for the kind of-- for its medium and for what it's for,
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.160]   it's incredibly sticky and engaging.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.880]   And people love it.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.400]   And for certain kinds of media, I'm
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.960]   not going to sit and watch Apocalypse Now in a YouTube
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.480]   size and format.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.840]   But for the kinds of content that YouTube is pushing out,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.680]   it's incredibly sticky and engaging.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.560]   And I just-- I don't know.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.760]   It just seems to me that it's really--
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.640]   sometimes it's perilous and it's very easy
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.280]   to get into these mutually exclusive arguments about media
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.760]   and who's going to use what and what's going to replace what.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.200]   And just to me, as maybe I'm just not a very picky consumer,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.800]   but I think those arguments tend to go nowhere.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.400]   And I wonder in some ways if a case can be made for--
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:21.960]   I don't know.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.840]   There's a part of me that wonders when more people
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.080]   find out about things like handbrake
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.040]   and read things like Mark Pilgrim's tutorial
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.160]   on how to back up your DVDs.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.640]   That I wonder in some ways if the longevity of certain media
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.240]   are going to come down to how you can get stuff off there
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.480]   and put it onto your devices.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.960]   Because more and more people hate being locked up
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.240]   by this stuff.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.960]   Says the guy who buys a bunch of stuff off iTunes.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.480]   But I even know a lot of people-- I'm too lazy.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.400]   I buy stuff off iTunes and then I just buy them again.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.320]   I literally-- I'll lose the songs
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.800]   and I just buy them again and everything else.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.120]   But I know a lot of people who immediately strip the DRM
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.480]   out of even iTunes.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.520]   And it's not something that they wait.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.880]   They just don't want to deal with it later.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.200]   They don't want to--
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.520]   And so it's one of those things that I
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   think that it's going to be interesting to see--
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.000]   I think people always want to have something that
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.480]   is transparent to them.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.160]   And the closer the industry can get to transparency,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.400]   the easier it's going to be for them to not have this issue.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.560]   But the problem is they don't want it to be transparent.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.800]   What's funny is there's all these--
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.960]   we're probably going down the traditional rat hole here.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.680]   But there's all these little islands of conversation
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.600]   that don't always get connected up with each other.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.480]   And one of them that I think is really interesting
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.760]   is you have this one alleyway conversation that's
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.440]   all about HD.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   And it's never going to work because it's so big.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.480]   And how are you going to download that over the internet?
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.920]   And then there's other discussion over here about BitTorrent.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.320]   And that's only ever all we ever talk about BitTorrent
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.040]   and how it's used for stealing and stuff.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.600]   And when you pull those two together--
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.360]   But they're two together and you get something really powerful
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:51.880]   going on.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.680]   The ability to move enormous smiles.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.400]   Absolutely.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.920]   And that's the thing that the thing that the real smack
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.280]   on the head for me with BitTorrent was just the first time
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.440]   I used it and realized that for somebody who had used Napster
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.840]   back in, whatever, '99 and 2000, to now realize that this
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.880]   was a medium where the more popular something was,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.720]   the more quickly it was going to get out.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.960]   Which is the kind of idea that it just seems
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.880]   like some of these companies--
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.640]   Well, and that's the interesting thing,
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.480]   a big file that a lot of people watch
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.560]   is actually the perfect solution for BitTorrent.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.880]   And you're not moving 6 ounces of plastic
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.560]   across the company in a country-made truck.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.880]   But what you needed was what you needed for that to work
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.720]   with someone to start building organized systems that
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.680]   allow you to cascade who gets it first.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.800]   And I think that that-- I don't know how much that's
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.960]   happened so far in the democracy or the video player.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.680]   But that is where you send it out to 10, then 100, then 1,000,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.880]   and then flip it on.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.400]   What you don't want to do is have it all be one piece.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.480]   You don't want to send it out to a million all at one time.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.600]   You want to cascade that so that the torrent works correctly.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.120]   And maybe to bring it quickly back to the Mac,
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.360]   because that's theoretically what the podcast is about.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.040]   It may be in the next OS.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   It could be.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.840]   But we go back to also John's suggestion, his pick.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.320]   Did you play with that BitTorrent X?
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.240]   It is awesome.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.080]   Have you played with this at all?
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   Have you played with it?
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.440]   It's a torrent X.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.360]   Torrent X, sorry.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.840]   And I think it was David Watanabe.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.000]   Yeah, so there's another app that's called Acquisition.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.160]   Have you heard of Acquisition?
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.800]   So Acquisition is in Nutella.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.320]   Like a lime wire.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.240]   It's like a lime wire Nutella thing
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.520]   that you can find all kinds of things you shouldn't be finding.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.800]   And download them really, really easily.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.480]   So what he did is he mixed that interface where
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.560]   you did all those searches with being able to just
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.560]   search torrent sites.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.280]   So he's able to just search for torrents.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.800]   And there's no like, oh, I'm going to move this torrent file
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.240]   over here.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.960]   And then I'm going to ask Azurias to grab it,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.960]   or I'm going to do whatever.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.240]   It's now you just--
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.400]   It's like three things.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.640]   So yeah, so first of all, you can create--
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.400]   he's got these basic searches where you put in terms.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.040]   And it automatically searches the BitTorrent sites
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.000]   of your choice, plus Google, plus Yahoo, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.200]   And then this is the beauty part.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.120]   And this is where it's an improvement over something
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.760]   like, how do you pronounce it, Azurias?
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   Azurias.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.640]   Azurias is it very-- it transparently
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.440]   understands what dot torrent means.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   And as soon as it detects the dot torrent,
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.200]   it starts the downloading for you.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   You don't have to go and do this sort of--
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.080]   for somebody who's not used to something like Azurias,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.920]   in addition to that, the interface being a little bit--
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   if you could have the preferences for Azurias,
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.080]   you could spend Labor Day weekend setting that thing up.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.280]   And with this, it's very simple.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.880]   You say, how much do you want to seed this after you've
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.760]   received it?
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.000]   It's totally transparent.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.520]   The searching, the adding, and then the downloading
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.720]   is all just completely transparent.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.040]   And it's really fast.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.160]   And the other thing is, is that it's
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   ability to grab onto lots of seeds and piers.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.200]   I was pretty amazed by it.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.160]   I mean, it just really picks it up quickly.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.280]   And an old Napster trick that I used to remember from back
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.120]   in the day was, if you wanted something,
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   you'd start downloading it from 20 different places
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.480]   and then watch the one that went fastest.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.960]   And then you know what I mean?
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.040]   And you could delete the others.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.600]   And that's something it never would have occurred to me
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.040]   in Azurias.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.240]   But now, it's so easy to do.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.080]   You just click, click, click.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.160]   And so I guess what I'm getting at
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.640]   is that just again, to bring it back to the Mac,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.040]   but this stuff is getting so much more transparent to use
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.840]   that I guess we're swimming a little bit.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.840]   To get to the point where you've got to wonder when companies
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.960]   are going to pick up on this stuff.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.720]   Well, and that's the rumor.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.880]   The rumor is-- and we'll see.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   There's lots of rumors, and we'll talk about them.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.760]   Well, Microsoft has invested a lot
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.880]   in the idea of integrating that into their--
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.560]   I don't know if it's primarily into Windows
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.640]   or if it's kind of a separate product.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:27.360]   But they spend a lot of press time talking about that.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.520]   If you look at what Apple's doing with iTunes Store,
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.840]   though, it does kind of the same thing
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.800]   without-- in a commercial realm, it's not playing--
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.440]   it's not like Skype where you're using your customers
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.960]   to send stuff around.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.560]   The systems they've built out and the networks that they've
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.280]   built, and they have been working on things like that
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.960]   since they started the QuickTime trailer.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.320]   I mean, when they first started doing that,
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.840]   they have a lot of experience in how
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.320]   to do that on a kind of commercial level of how
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.720]   to distribute high quality--
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.480]   Well, with Akamai, with caching and so on and so forth,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.720]   the big thing is using everybody's computer.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   And that's going to be the thing that--
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.600]   it'll be interesting to see how that goes.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.520]   Now, to move on, speaking of the iPod and trans--
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.720]   moving stuff around, Discovery Channel
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.160]   is going to air the inside story of the Apple iPod
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.840]   and Steve Jobs.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.000]   And I don't have the schedule for when this is going to happen.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.080]   But I find this very interesting.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.120]   I read an article.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.480]   There was an article in Wired Magazine that
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.720]   I thought was really, really good.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   And it was a last issue or two of Wired.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.760]   And we'll try to get it into the show notes here.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.480]   But it's-- oh, here it is.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.080]   Wednesday, 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.160]   the inside story of the iPod.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.240]   And so it's a documentary covering the development
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.720]   and spectacular success of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.120]   The description on the Discovery site is even better.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.680]   The iPod Revolution goes behind the scenes
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.960]   to uncover how Steve Jobs brought Apple back from the grave
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.600]   to create one of the iPod.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.280]   Exactly.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:12.440]   Yeah, well, I do have to say that I really enjoyed
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.680]   the Wired article.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.160]   And I just found it fascinating how they slowly built it up.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.120]   And Steve's obsession with not having a power button,
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.720]   which I'm really glad that I have a power button now, by the way.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.280]   And so-- and all those other things
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.840]   about the development of it and what it took to get there.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.920]   And I think that it gives you real insight into how Apple works.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.560]   And so I think that that looks really--
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.120]   I'm not going to t-v with it because I don't
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.840]   have a cable or a TV.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.320]   But I'm going to wait until I figure by Thursday or Friday
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.840]   it'll be on iTunes in the Discovery section.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.680]   And I'll just download it.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.640]   Have you guys seen that, by the way,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.480]   I'm going to go under a rat hole here for a second.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.880]   Attaboy.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.360]   Merlin.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.520]   Merlin has been prescribing riddle in for me.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.240]   I'm usually vice president in charge of rat holes.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.840]   But I'm happy to see this one to you.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.040]   Have you seen-- in iTunes, have you seen Discovery Atlas?
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.160]   Discovery Atlas.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.280]   I don't think I've seen that.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.680]   It's one of the best documentary series
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.240]   that I've ever seen.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.280]   So anyway, now we'll move.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.880]   It is interesting to see how much content is going
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.080]   into the video podcast.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.400]   I mean, how things are just--
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.800]   You just get whatever you want now.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.200]   I just assume that it's going to be up there.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.240]   I don't-- it's getting to the point, yeah, where-- so ubiquitous.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.200]   Do you buy a lot of stuff, Dan?
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.480]   I buy occasional things.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.080]   Because I have this whole thing because I don't have cable.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.520]   I justify it by buying, probably spending--
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   anywhere from $10 to $20 a week just kind of plowing through.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.520]   Oh, I want this, I want this, I want this, I want this.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.040]   And not having to think about it.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.400]   The biggest problem I have is actually
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.000]   stopping me from buying more from iTunes right now
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.720]   is just that I don't have enough hard drive space.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.280]   But outside of that--
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   I think that's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   I think that's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   That's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   That's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   That's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   That's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   That's a--
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   That's a--
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   That's a--
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   I agree with you.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   I think we keep coming back to that.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.040]   But I mean, one of the things I'm going to ask you
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.640]   after we're done here is what hard drive I should get,
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.120]   what big hard drive-- because all of this stuff just
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.840]   equals more and more gigabytes of crap you're piling up.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.480]   I have been loving the iTunes Store.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.360]   I've been using it to buy, shoot TV shows.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.160]   I bought 30 Rock.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.000]   I love it.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.800]   It does take up the hard drive space.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.880]   I've been kind of struggling with the idea of buying TV
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.200]   that's kind of a hard thing for me to cope with.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   But--
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.280]   Because it's free?
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.800]   Well--
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   Usually?
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   I don't know.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   Just because it doesn't seem like--
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.280]   But yeah, if it gives you what you want,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.240]   then that's the right thing to do.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.800]   Yeah, I like it because what we do with it is I'll just--
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.160]   I have a 17 inch that I've been using.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.040]   It's my old 17 inch, my ginormous 890 pound 17 inch.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.520]   I've been using it as like a multimedia computer.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.160]   So I don't need to carry it anywhere.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.240]   And I'll just have iTunes pull stuff down from there
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.680]   so I can just watch it on the TV with the S video out.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.320]   Oh, Alex is holding up a hard drive in a bag.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   Hotachi.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.560]   Hotachi, what size you got?
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.280]   Not only is Macbreak sponsored by Hotachi,
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:56.960]   I bought a hard drive.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.680]   I used some of that money from the sponsorship
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.600]   that they gave us for Macbreak.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.800]   And I bought a hard drive from them.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.040]   Wow, that is really an elegant use of money.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.560]   You had exactly.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.280]   It's very economical.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.720]   Yeah, so this is a 160 gig portable drive.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.520]   What do they get for one of those?
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.800]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   Yeah, here's the problem.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.680]   This is the Pixel Pro.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.520]   What's one of these costs?
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.400]   I think it's like 200 bucks.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.320]   200 bucks sounds right?
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.000]   Yeah, 200, 250.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.200]   And is this something that a not too bright, 40 year old man
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.080]   could install in his own home?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.600]   Really?
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   You don't need a special bracket or a magic wand
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:29.800]   or anything?
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.480]   You need MacBook Pro?
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.200]   Yeah, it's in the MacBook.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.560]   I think you have to take off the bottom, though,
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.720]   to put it in.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.120]   You have to take a lot of off the other side.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:37.520]   Hard.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.840]   But that's the 500--
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.080]   You're talking about no one.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.080]   You know, still, I wish I had a 300 gig drive in here.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.640]   I think I could fill that thing up in no time.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.000]   I guess they make a 200 one.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.680]   But I like to stay one step behind.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.720]   Whatever the biggest drive is, I usually step back one.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.320]   And let that drive sort out its issues,
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.520]   because it's on the bleeding edge
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.240]   and this is only on the cutting edge.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.760]   And so the biggest thing that's been delayed--
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.920]   it's been sitting in the office for a couple of weeks.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.200]   And I'm just waiting for time.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.720]   When do you have a data only work on your--
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.520]   This is another time for me to put in a plug for--
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.000]   well, there's several apps I could put in a plug for.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.800]   But as long as we've gone down a meta rat hole--
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.520]   Super duper.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.080]   Super duper.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.640]   This is a D-super duper now?
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.240]   Yes, I think it's super duper.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.600]   I always think it when I think of Super Duper,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.160]   I think it was Abba.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.040]   Super duper.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.960]   That's super duper.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.880]   We're all old.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.080]   That'd be good.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.400]   That'd be good.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:23.880]   That'd be good.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.400]   That'd be good.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.040]   That'd be really good.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.640]   They still might use the money.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.200]   They still sell millions of CDs.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.040]   Oh my god, they're incredibly--
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.400]   There's another rattle for you.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.200]   I used to be a carbon copy calendar man.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.240]   I think it's like it's a good app.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.920]   But Super duper is just so brain dead easy to use.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.800]   And it's so funny.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.320]   It used to be-- do you remember what a witch doctor ritual
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.080]   it used to be to replace a hard drive?
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.720]   It used to be--
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.280]   It was like a week.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.880]   It was like a week of--
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.520]   Here's what you want to do.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.960]   And all the incantations and praying and begging.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.480]   It was a full day to get started.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.120]   And then there was the four days of,
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.240]   I don't know what's not going to work
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.960]   and what is going to work or like that.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.640]   Did you have that experience, sir?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.400]   I've had a couple of traumatic experiences.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.640]   One was with an iBook that I was used to taking part
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.200]   the old titanium power books.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.880]   I mean, I had taken several of those apart.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.040]   And I told a client that I would get a hard drive put
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.680]   in her iBook.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   And I gave myself half hour to do it on midnight.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.560]   So I started into it.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.880]   And I think there's five million different types of screws
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.320]   and several of each one holding--
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.880]   The basically the iBook is wrapped around a hard drive.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.960]   Layers and layers and layers.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's kind of like that.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.440]   So actually, after you avoided every possible warranty
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.520]   in the iBook, you had to put the drive in.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.720]   Oh, yeah, there was no left.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.880]   But I got it in there.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.040]   But the other thing about hard drives in the new package
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.080]   is that they have a bathtub lifespan curve.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.960]   You heard that?
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.320]   No.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.440]   That is a new term for me.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.960]   That's a bathtub curve of the likelihood of them failing
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.160]   is initially high.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.960]   So if you look at a chart, and then it goes down,
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.440]   and then it stays pretty reliable for three years.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.720]   And then after that three-year period,
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.600]   then the likelihood of it failing is going to come up.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.360]   Oddly enough, right after the Apple protection
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.960]   wears off.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.560]   Yeah, so with hard drives, I mean,
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.440]   they're kind of engineered with parts
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.080]   that are designed to last for that long,
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.960]   because you're probably not going to need--
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.560]   I mean, it would be better to have something that could fail
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.600]   in three years than something that it couldn't afford.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.200]   But if you're running something like that,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.760]   what's called smart, the thing where it's
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.040]   supposedly watching for defects.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.120]   I have never found smart to be very intelligent.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.720]   I have never gotten anything out of that.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.960]   I've always wondered if I'm just not--
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.120]   I've had laptops that sounded like a helicopter
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.800]   was trying to get out of them.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.960]   And smart was just, hey, OK, you know?
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.480]   Everything's--
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.040]   Two thumbs up.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.760]   Everything's awesome.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.720]   And the thing was just--
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.280]   sounded like someone falling down a well.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.640]   The conventional wisdom when I was a lad
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.000]   was that if a hard drive--
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.640]   if your Mac hard drive was going to break,
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.920]   it would usually be almost always in the first week
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.760]   to 30 days.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.280]   Right.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.000]   And then if you were-- so when I was a little kind of--
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.600]   see the pants Mac admin, I'd always
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.480]   kind of hold my breath for the first 30 days.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.880]   And we actually did have--
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.640]   I want-- we bought five Lacy hard drives.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.960]   They were probably, I don't know, 50-man hard drives
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.720]   or something in the early '90s.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.920]   And three of the five drives crashed
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.160]   within the first two weeks.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.600]   It was just probably a bad day.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.760]   You know, maybe they dropped a chicken into the assembly
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.040]   line or something.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.320]   It was periodic the C chickens that falls in.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.760]   But I hadn't heard of the bathtub curve.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.800]   Three years, huh?
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.520]   They're nuts?
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.280]   Yeah, so that's kind of what you're describing us.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.720]   It's bad to start off with.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.920]   And then it goes normal.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.600]   And then it's-- then your risk of failures up again.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.440]   But yeah, so--
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   yeah.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.320]   The biggest thing that we cannot underline more--
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.040]   in every single show is that a second copy of everything
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.080]   is a good thing.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.920]   At least a second copy.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.600]   This is something-- another one of the threads
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.480]   that we'll probably be picking up in future weeks.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.440]   But we're going to come back to our--
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.760]   we've talked about this a little bit--
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.680]   coming back to our network or NAS hard drive project.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.600]   We're going to come back to--
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.520]   I'm going to build one.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.960]   There was a-- are you going to build it?
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.720]   I'm going to build it.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.040]   There's a lot of interest about that.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.320]   And as I mentioned, there's a guy who's
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.720]   writing a really good piece for 43 folders
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.600]   about how the system he's put together, which
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.800]   is-- looks dynamite.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.320]   And the word--
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.000]   Is it a 5.0?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.920]   Is he doing a 5.0?
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.360]   Rate 5?
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.320]   Yeah, I think it's a rate 5.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.720]   I still need to read the article.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.240]   I owe him.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:17.720]   Sorry.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.640]   I'll get back to you soon.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.320]   The holidays.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:26.440]   But the thing that he mentioned in passing--
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.400]   we need a staff.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.440]   We could get a staff to just follow the things
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.640]   we have to understand.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.960]   He said something about these NAS drives becoming
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.520]   more mat-compatible in the near future, which sounds--
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   because right now, there's still some limitations.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.840]   There's very-- there's certain kinds of characters
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.360]   that it doesn't like and stuff like that.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.360]   But--
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.040]   I don't use any of those characters.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.000]   NAFS drive or Apple filing for a lot of games.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.920]   If you grab one of these Buffalo terror stations
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.640]   and plug it in, it's supposedly not natively
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.040]   super-mac friendly.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.880]   And apparently--
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.800]   It's like an Apple share type.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.320]   Right.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   As a share, right?
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.520]   Yeah, I guess you just plug it into your ethernet,
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.960]   and there's a setup for pretty basic stuff.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.440]   So just acts like a standalone server.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:04.920]   That's right.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   That's right.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.880]   And I just want--
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.680]   I'm still looking forward to two terabytes, though.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.320]   I just want to say, having two terabytes on a network
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   has me a little giddy.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.840]   As someone who has 14 terabytes in the other room,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.160]   you'll think that it's important until you have it,
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.560]   and then you'll use it all up.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.520]   They're like closets.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.920]   You will find a way to fill them up.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.600]   And we have.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.240]   We're constantly like, OK, what are we going to throw away?
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.960]   How do we back up?
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.720]   And that's why I got into the raw drive stuff,
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.000]   is because we needed pool stuff off of our--
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.600]   When you and I were talking about this before the show
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.400]   and how you deal with stuff like all the media that you acquire.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.880]   And I mean, I've talked about this a little bit on 43 folders,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.560]   where I have a chronic sync script that automatically
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.920]   syncs up my iTunes library to this canonical Uber library,
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.440]   so I can kind of throw things out freely on my local drive
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.160]   and not worry that I'll lose the only copy I've got.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.680]   But I just think increasingly that's
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.320]   going to be an issue that we've all got to deal with.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.760]   Because if you want to stay portable as these devices
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.600]   keep being smaller, how do you deal with the fact that you--
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.100]   It just seems like if somebody came up with a Mac friendly
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.720]   and they ask--
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.680]   And I think there's two things.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.120]   I think that one is backing up and one is these secondary things.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.480]   I think another thing that I'm learning to do--
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.360]   and I'm learning to do this in all areas of my life
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.920]   is just to realize that I'm never going to use that file again
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.520]   and just actually throw away.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.960]   And we're talking about this also.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.520]   The whole thing--
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.840]   --back up everything.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.680]   Here's the problem with photos, is that you
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.400]   used to shoot film photos and you'd only take a handful of photos.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.440]   And then you'd only print.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.000]   You'd only keep a certain number of prints of each one.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.440]   And then those are the ones that you used.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.520]   And now I have money no object.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.000]   You can--
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.880]   I have every crap photo I ever took sitting in a--
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.480]   I've got 11 gigs of really crappy photos on my hard drive
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:35.980]   right now.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.160]   It's ridiculous.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.160]   The other thing, just to quickly mention and passing
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.400]   is just this whole idea of getting some kind of a script
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.880]   that will run your backups for you automatically.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.520]   Something that's worth encouraging.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.080]   Time machine.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.000]   Time machine.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.120]   Have you used portable home directories in Tiger?
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:52.520]   No.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.640]   Portable home directories in Tiger.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.680]   Is it out?
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.320]   Yeah, it came with Tiger.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.280]   It was sort of supported prior to that.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.640]   I thought that was in the next one.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.680]   Well, you have to have--
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.520]   You have to have a Tiger server running.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.560]   But basically, the idea is it's kind of similar to on the window
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.200]   side roaming profiles.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.720]   You can put on a stick and stuff like that?
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.160]   Well, the idea is that you have a network server
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.880]   that you log into.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.480]   So instead of logging to the computer locally,
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.880]   you log into your home directory.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.040]   So you take an extra--
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.720]   Or a spare G5 or whatever.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.680]   And you just hook it to the network.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:27.960]   Right.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.080]   Well, the idea of portable home directory--
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.400]   the idea of a portable home directory
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.360]   is what was perfected in Tiger so that you could sync your laptop
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.680]   and then unplug.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.000]   And you could work on it offline.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.840]   And then when you come back into your network,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.640]   it syncs up and syncs all your files together.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:51.840]   That's only an option if you have a open directory setup
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.080]   or using active directory.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.840]   And you need a CPU running that, right?
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   So it's not just something you could do on a RAID or--
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.960]   Is it rumored to be in--
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.080]   or plan to be in leopard?
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.480]   Isn't that I read something about that?
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.520]   Well, that already works.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.720]   You just have to have--
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.840]   But without having a server.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.640]   Well, they were talking about even prior--
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   before Tiger came out, they were talking about putting your home
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.800]   on an iPod and things like that.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.640]   You could do that.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.400]   But what's really clever about actually having a server
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.160]   instead of a thumb drive or something like that
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.040]   is that you can have a desktop--
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.280]   a lot of people have a desktop and a laptop.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.640]   And you have stuff on one and stuff on the other.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.680]   And it's hard to synchronize things together.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.720]   If you have portable home directories, you can have both.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.640]   Right.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.680]   They're both the same essentially.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.640]   Yeah, they're both talking to the same directory.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.920]   And the drive can be different.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:43.000]   So what happens when I have a 250 gig drive on my main computer
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.840]   and a 160 gig drive on my laptop?
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.240]   Well, your home directory is whatever size it is.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.560]   OK, so it gets to be too big then.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.920]   That's the thing though.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.640]   But if it's on the server, then you have--
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.440]   But if I were going to design this,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.680]   I would add some nuance to this.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.600]   And I'm thinking of that.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.560]   There's a great app out there whose name escapes me
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.280]   that lets you sync--
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.760]   you pick which browser is your primary browser,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   whether that's Safari, Firefox, Flock, what have you.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.080]   Say this is the daddy.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.600]   And then it cascades from there to all your other browsers.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.000]   It makes sure that all your bookmarks sync correctly to them.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.640]   And you identify this canonical ones.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.520]   I would love it if somebody did what you're describing.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.560]   But then said, OK, we'll have my canonical MacBook Pro,
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.200]   which is-- or let's say, for a second of argument,
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.040]   let's say it's a Mac Pro.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.200]   Let's say you've got a tower.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.800]   That's your main drive.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.120]   But so I had this MacBook Pro that I
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.840]   want to as closely as possible mirror all my preferences,
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.000]   my application support, all those important library-type
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.520]   things.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.240]   But then I'd also like to have just basically--
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.080]   let's say for me, something like my Quicksilver settings
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.920]   and my basic preferences that I could do, for example,
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.000]   put on a stick.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.200]   I mean, it would be great to me if you could support multiple
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.840]   devices and say, you know what?
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.720]   Don't move my iTunes over or don't move my downloads directory
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.960]   over, but for each of these devices.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.480]   Because I mean--
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.600]   Is that a little bit of what the not Mac does?
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.400]   Well, that's kind of what Time Machine would do.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.080]   You can say, take this local or network drive
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.440]   and copy my stuff to it every day or every week or whatever.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.920]   But like what you're talking about,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.200]   there's multiple types of sync.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.920]   There's the .Mac type sync, which is very handy for--
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.360]   Doesn't really work for me.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.840]   Well, I really like it by my files.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.560]   It's a good thing.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.320]   Well, part of the problem with the .Mac,
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.840]   it's not good for moving on your files.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.480]   That's kind of the--
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.640]   Well, it's also you've got to have the same user account.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.480]   And understandably, you've got to have the same user
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.960]   account on other computer.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   But when I show up at Mac Break, I
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.640]   want to shoot the video show.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.040]   I want to shoot a certain number of files from my home directory
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.720]   under your hard drive.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.160]   So having a way to basically identify all of--
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.000]   Gosh, I was about to say backup.app.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And I stopped myself.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.440]   But I'll ask some kind of program where you could go in
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.560]   and say, I hear the directories that I want to have.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.400]   And one thing I experimented with for a long time
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.880]   that I just never really got working
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.400]   was the idea of having a portable drive beat me.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.720]   And it's something that I'd love to have.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.560]   That would get cumbersome after a while.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.040]   It would be.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.840]   But it was just one of those things that if it was easy--
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.120]   And then somebody else could be you.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.680]   Yes, someone else could be exactly--
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.200]   It's your soul, USB 2 soul.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.360]   Did you see that someone actually--
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.960]   there's this service-- who does the service that does the--
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.240]   it's a security service where if your Mac is stolen--
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.320]   Oh, takes pictures.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.280]   It takes every log in.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.120]   --it uses the built-in.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.160]   And it uploads it.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.240]   And a guy reported it.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.680]   And they actually caught somebody.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.000]   I mean, you hear about it.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   You think, oh, that's a great idea.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.680]   And then you never hear anyone actually use it.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.760]   There's one little hack.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.960]   I don't know exactly what it changes.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.640]   A script or something that's at the--
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   before the login screen comes up so that it'll actually
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.400]   record every login attempt.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:34.720]   Right.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.040]   Yeah, it was an interesting thing where it actually took--
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:37.840]   it took the photos.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.560]   They found the guy.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:38.920]   They--
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.680]   The Mac Lojak.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.160]   Yeah, Mac Lojak, exactly.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.880]   So now you just need GPS built into it.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.160]   And then you just know exactly where it is.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.040]   Or big spikes that come out.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.920]   Well, that'd be mine.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.480]   So now, have you guys seen--
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.520]   is anyone used iLike?
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.520]   I very quickly installed it.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.320]   And then it was one of the things where I installed it.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.000]   And then I took it off.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.080]   It seems kind of like a last FM integrated iTunes thing.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.520]   Is that right?
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.560]   It's what lets you have friends.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.600]   It watches your tracks.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.280]   It says you want--
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.320]   So what it says is, what it says it does is,
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.360]   is discover new music, check out what your friends are
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.200]   listening to, browse the libraries of people
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.280]   with similar tastes, and get free MP3 downloads
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.880]   by new artists matched to your own musical tastes.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.800]   Share and compare.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.880]   You can share music libraries with your friends, browse,
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.120]   and sample their most played songs,
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   and compare your compatibility scores.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.600]   And you can get iLike sidebar for iTunes,
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   which is auto-organize your iTunes library.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.240]   It's only there.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.160]   That's what freaked me out.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.680]   I didn't see anything in it.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.320]   They let you turn it off.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.480]   You don't want people to necessarily--
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.400]   Well, it's a drawer.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.720]   I can-- you guys can't see this in podcast land,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.800]   but it makes a drawer here that even when it's collapsed,
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.320]   sticks out a little bit, which some part of my lizard brain
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.200]   really hated that.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.520]   And I get a lot of that functionality out of Last FM.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.800]   I mean, that's kind of where my friends are.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.880]   Like, all of these things, like, do we really need
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.080]   another one of these networks out there that everybody's going to--
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:51.920]   Like, Last FM--
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.080]   Like, like, like, like, for instance?
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.120]   Kind of, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.020]   But Last FM, do you use Last FM?
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.860]   No.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.960]   Audio Scroblar.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.000]   It basically runs as a little--
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.240]   the interface for it is a menu.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.920]   And it basically watches your iTunes
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.400]   and uploads that to a site.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.200]   And it's kind of cool.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.320]   So then you can do the kind of, you know,
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.360]   put on my website here's what I'm listening to.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.000]   But also, you can have friends.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.040]   And so you can-- the really neat part
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.080]   is you can then have a streaming radio of your friends' tracks.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.800]   So Last FM goes out there and cuts deals with all these companies
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   so that they can get access to the songs.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.700]   And you can listen to a streaming version of what your friends are
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:27.660]   listening to.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.940]   It's pretty cool your little neighborhood.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.860]   This is a little like what I was talking about in the last--
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.260]   the other show where I was thinking what I wanted to have with this--
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.220]   Never back to the playlist.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.220]   I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.620]   I'm just saying-- not the playlist, but the idea of--
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.740]   maybe we were talking about it in Twim.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.220]   I get a little cross.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.220]   This is why we need the whiteboard.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.460]   What did I talk about in the last Twim?
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.900]   Well, the idea of being able to watch--
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.460]   I think it was in Twim, we were talking about it
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.100]   where I want to be able to say--
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.700]   show me everybody with 80%--
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.400]   a library that's 80% like mine, or 40% like mine,
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.360]   or 50% like mine.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.680]   And then just play me the music that is--
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.600]   if I have-- if more than 20% or 30% of the people
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.560]   have that, this song, show me what that song is.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.520]   And so it's not just a handful of people.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.320]   It could be hundreds.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.120]   It could be thousands.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.480]   But it's just showing me where when
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.200]   it reaches over some spike that I've set up,
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.280]   it shows me what that is and kind of creates
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.840]   that six degrees of separation where suddenly you're just
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.880]   the stuff you're interested in is fine.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.100]   And it's not just for music.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.460]   It could be for news or everyone.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.580]   Well, last FM recently--
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:26.880]   I don't know if they recently added this.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.700]   I noticed it recently-- is this ability
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.180]   to click on any of your friends?
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.660]   And it will tell you how close your DNA is with that person.
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.060]   So within any of the people that are on your little friends
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.220]   list, it'll say that your musical taste is very much
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.860]   like this person or not very much like.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.740]   And here's the artist that you have in common.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.420]   And your family came from Nigeria.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:46.380]   That's right.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.500]   And I like your hair like that.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.540]   It looks like you look pretty.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.440]   You stole your whole friend's library.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.520]   Automically reporting you.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.000]   I am in your iTunes.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.800]   So now, Dan, you wrote a long article recently
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.680]   about how the iPhone could shake up the industry.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.520]   Prior to that, written about the iPhone
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.200]   is something that Apple--
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.760]   what they wouldn't be doing.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.920]   And so then I can virtually write about the other side,
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.520]   too, because I like to make sure I'm covering it every base.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.460]   But I wrote about inside Apple's iPhone, not so much
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.260]   that it's going to be called the iPhone.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.060]   But what was interesting is what Apple can do in the service
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.500]   provider realm, what they can offer.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.900]   Because a lot of people think about what Apple could offer
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.020]   in a phone.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:38.060]   Every phone that I ever had is so frustrating the interface
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.100]   and things like that.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:39.940]   That's what--
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.940]   getting right.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.300]   And here's the thing is this segment of the show
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.660]   is dedicated to Scott Born.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.940]   So-- but I think this is why Scott's so excited about it.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.780]   Why I'm excited about it.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.860]   I have to admit my trio is slowly falling apart.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:57.860]   It's just slowly dying.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.220]   And there's all kinds of little problems with it right now.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.780]   And so I'm limping along with this trio,
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.700]   hoping that I can get through whenever Apple releases
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.200]   the iPhone.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.060]   And I think that what you just said touched upon why so many
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.460]   people are excited about it is that the interface is for just
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.980]   about every phone ever designed are completely useless.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.900]   And then in addition to just the kind of things that seem
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.660]   like they should have been fixed previously,
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.980]   there's also the whole phone industry
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:31.660]   and how it's really just set up in kind of a non-consumer
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.540]   oriented way.
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.020]   So we--
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.180]   It's kind of a surfdom.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.940]   I like to think of it as surfdom.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.180]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.860]   There's no choice because the people that are creating
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.300]   phones like Motorola and all the different manufacturers
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:47.060]   and including the trio, they can put features on the phone
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.780]   that consumers would benefit from.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.700]   But the service providers don't always
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.980]   want those features to even work.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.300]   And some like Verizon turn them off like Bluetooth
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.860]   because they want people to use their phones
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.020]   to use their network--
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.020]   The way they're saying.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.660]   Right.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.100]   As much as possible.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.540]   And so the event features like text messaging.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.300]   That's not a feature.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.780]   That's using your phone.
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.460]   But they've set it up so you can charge you per--
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.340]   We just fascinating because in the United States,
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.460]   text messaging costs more than really
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.860]   costs end up costing a lot extra over your voice usage
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.580]   of voice, whereas you go to Africa and text messaging
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.500]   is much cheaper than using the phone.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.220]   And everybody uses text messaging because it's--
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   For banking, right?
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.340]   Isn't that like a big way people do their banking?
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.860]   Everything.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.140]   I think Africa is just banking through emails,
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:33.820]   according to my email.
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:34.580]   I saw that in Harper's.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.300]   There's a Harper's index thing about that.
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:36.780]   You can text--
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.180]   Oh, is that you're getting a lot of--
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.980]   from Nigeria?
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.340]   No, it's not--
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.180]   But you can use--
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:44.180]   I think you can use text messaging just to actually get gas
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:44.980]   in Zimbabwe.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.820]   Because it is almost about buying diesel there.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.660]   But it's--
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.860]   So there's text messaging.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.380]   There's the photo mail thing where they want you to take
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.180]   photos with your camera phone and mail.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.700]   But they're interested in features
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.060]   to which they can associate some kind of a service that's
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:52:59.580]   going to cost.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.140]   So yeah, it's using their network.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.020]   And that's the whole purpose of doing it.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.740]   So the hardware makers are constrained
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:08.300]   by-- they can't directly sell to consumers
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.860]   because phones aren't sold as phones that people buy.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.380]   And then--
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.580]   Their accessories to your service.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.080]   Right.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.340]   They're subsidized by the service.
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:20.180]   So you-- the trio phone that costs $600 or $700 is $50
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.380]   if you get service.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.020]   So obviously that $500 is coming out of--
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.820]   you're paying that through your service.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:29.700]   So Apple has the opportunity that a lot of other manufacturers
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:30.860]   don't have.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.460]   I mean, no manufacturers really have retail stores.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.300]   And kind of a relationship with customers
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.100]   or where Apple has customers buy pretty much anything
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.300]   they put out.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   And so just their ability to say, here's a $400 device.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.220]   And people would be, oh, yeah, I'll buy that.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.300]   Where that doesn't happen in the cell phone.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.540]   Industry people looking at a phone,
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.900]   they want-- they kind of have this expectation of it being free.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.980]   And that devalues the perceived value of the phone.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.180]   You will think of phones as just being kind of like a free
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.220]   accessory that they get with their service.
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.220]   So that would give Apple the opportunity
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.500]   to really kind of turn things around.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.900]   And why would the phone companies go along with this?
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.700]   Because Apple's selling service.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.620]   And I don't know as much about it in the United States,
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.260]   but in other countries, there's a push behind what
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.660]   they call the mobile virtual network operator.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.700]   It's kind of similar to when the phone company was
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.500]   on the regular phone company was busted up.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.580]   And you couldn't initially choose your local service
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:34.940]   provider.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.660]   You just had a mob bell of whoever it was for your area.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.380]   But you gave you the choice of long distance service.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.260]   And so that's kind of what Apple is doing
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.980]   or what they have the potential to do,
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:48.500]   is come in and say, here's a way to choose.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.220]   And you have a phone.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.780]   You can use singular or you can use.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.740]   Now, do you think that the real question is like,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.900]   for instance, will the phone support CDMA?
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.060]   Which would be-- that's Verizon's.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.420]   If they don't support it as a CDMA,
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.540]   then you're not going to have a Verizon iPhone.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.780]   Well, Verizon is one of my least favorite companies.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.700]   I hope they're not sponsoring your--
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.780]   They're not.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.940]   I happen to use Verizon because it's the only one
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.020]   that works in my office.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.580]   So our office is like a fair day cage.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.340]   And so Verizon happens to work here.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.460]   And that's why we use it.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.460]   And also, it doesn't conflict with audio signals.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.860]   For those of you who are into podcasts, GSM
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.620]   is the devil.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.540]   Because even if you silence your phone,
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.100]   you'll hear this little click, click, click, click,
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.300]   anytime the GSM phone wants to talk to the network,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.260]   you'll hear it on these audio cables.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.300]   And CDMA, the reason I use-- one of the reasons I use Verizon
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.100]   is because CDMA doesn't do that.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.500]   It's more secure.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.420]   That's why it's a military spec.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.660]   So anyway--
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.620]   I think it's a military spec because the military
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.940]   is behind Qualcomm.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.900]   It's American company.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.700]   Whereas GSM is--
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.100]   Possibly.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:48.700]   --the EU company.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.020]   That's why--
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:50.020]   It's actually more secure for more
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.380]   to understand than the CDMA is.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:55.660]   All of the United States or all of the world is a GSM,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.820]   except for Iraq.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.380]   We rebuilt it in our own image.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.740]   Well, but it's only Verizon, I think,
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:05.180]   because I think that T-Mobile, singular, are all GSM providers.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.260]   I don't think that they're--
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.060]   I don't think anybody else--
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.780]   I think Verizon's the only one that does CDMA that I know of.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.500]   It's apparently big in South America as well.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.340]   Is it-- yeah.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.220]   So this could really change it.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:23.380]   So the-- I think that it seems that this is really a--
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.820]   providers working with Apple is more out of fear.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.020]   If one provider doesn't-- if you're left out of it,
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.340]   it could be very painful.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.140]   Would you agree?
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.380]   Well, we don't know yet.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.180]   It would certainly be--
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.940]   And Apple's best is just to have one phone.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.700]   What I'm saying is is that if Apple makes a phone that works
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.740]   on a series of different providers,
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.100]   if you're the provider that they're not working with,
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.260]   it could be a painful experience for you,
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.100]   given that you'd lose a lot of service.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.380]   Right.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.660]   And that's what the providers do now.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.420]   They get one of the new phones that's coming out,
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.140]   like when the trio first came out or when--
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.140]   They want it first.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.660]   Yeah, they get an exclusive deal with it.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:58.700]   So anybody that wants that phone will have to switch to them.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.260]   So Apple would have some pull there and saying,
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.340]   here's a popular phone.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.780]   Are you going to support it or not?
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.820]   But I don't know.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.940]   I kind of like the idea of GSM just because of the smart card
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.580]   idea that-- and it's common in Europe--
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.700]   that you get a phone.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.100]   And then you get whatever--
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.140]   Yeah, you can buy a smart card off the shelf.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.820]   And use it--
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.700]   Because even now, the phones that are here now that have GSM
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.860]   don't let you-- you can't just switch the card out, right?
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:25.940]   I can't think you can.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.140]   But the option for getting cards is not--
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.380]   It's not like you just go buy a card.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.140]   It's not common, right?
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.500]   Anyway, that ends our iPhone thing
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.980]   unless Merlin has a--
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.460]   No, I'm good.
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.540]   So Merlin loves talking about the iPhone.
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.180]   It's all he talks about off the show.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.180]   And for some reason, he won't really discuss it on the show.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.740]   It's something that I feel like I'm just so close to.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.820]   And it takes up so much of my thought in the day that I--
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:58.300]   I guess I feel like they don't want to push that on people.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.140]   Apple is number two in the tech hot growth
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.260]   according to Business Week.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.140]   USA.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.100]   USA.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.700]   Google is number one, I think.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:06.660]   I think that's what the--
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.260]   Alex, what does that mean?
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.300]   It means the second place--
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.580]   It means it's not number two.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.340]   It means that Business Week made an arbitrary list,
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.660]   and Apple came in number two.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.820]   What's the metric, though?
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.060]   I don't know what the metric is.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:17.740]   My name--
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.380]   I mean, is it a unitless number?
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:19.940]   What is it?
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.780]   My computer won't come up right now.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.780]   So I was going to talk about it here,
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.500]   and then my bandwidth went to zero.
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.660]   No, I think a lot of it has to do with the hot tech growth
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.260]   ranking.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.780]   And I'm not sure exactly what they're--
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.260]   I think a lot of it has to do with percentage growth.
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:42.620]   For instance, Google, over the last 12 months, grew 77%.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.900]   So that's not bad.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.060]   That's a number of employees.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.460]   That's a revenue.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.020]   Wow.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.140]   Google is approaching 10 billion in revenues
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:56.940]   with growth over-- in the past 12 months, still at a torrid.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:57.740]   That's what they said.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.300]   I didn't say it.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.540]   Torrid.
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.380]   How much of that is--
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:00.900]   77%.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.500]   How much of that is that, where it's at?
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.420]   That's--
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.300]   I have no idea.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.420]   But it's a lot.
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:09.660]   And Apple grew 39% sales.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.780]   That's not bad.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.660]   To 19.3 billion.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.860]   You know, Apple's building a cap doubled.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.940]   I was researching when I was doing that iPhone story,
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.140]   and I was looking at stocks.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.420]   And from the high point in 2000, most tech companies
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.820]   have not really recovered to where they were.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:27.540]   Apple has tripled what they were at the height of the.com.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.860]   It's really affected my marketocracy ranking.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.540]   Wow.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.900]   So I don't actually own any stock.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.540]   I mentioned it in one show before that I had Apple stock,
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.780]   and I didn't make it clear that I have virtual Apple stock.
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.300]   I don't have real Apple stock.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.100]   I just play the market.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.540]   It's like the financial version of a make-believe girlfriend.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.900]   It's like dream teams and marketocracy is like that.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.460]   So I have this-- I have my Apple.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:48.940]   My Apple--
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.860]   I'm excited to see the idea of fun.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.100]   And I'm crushing the market in Apple.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:53.500]   Let's go to the--
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.300]   Congratulations.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.500]   I just thought I'd let you know.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   That's another-- Merlin's going-- if he goes down one more
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.900]   rat hole, I'm just going to kill him.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.780]   So anyway, so Apple is doing pretty well.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.740]   We're going to see how that--
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.780]   And I saw some units.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.860]   They're moving some--
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.100]   Well, here's the thing is that what I think is amazing
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.020]   is when you see this--
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.420]   they're talking about-- you see Apple's growth,
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.580]   and then you still see these analysts that come up and say,
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.580]   "Apple should just make OS 10 available to all PCs.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.900]   They're not doing very well on their hardware sales.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.460]   They're-- the hardware sales have never been actually
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.300]   better than they are right now.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.700]   But they're constantly-- these analysts are really hooked
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.220]   on the ID.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:33.220]   And Vista, by the way, is according to some writing
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.540]   its own suicide note.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.340]   That's what they say.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.140]   Well, it's interesting that some of the same analysts
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:41.580]   say that Apple should give away OS 10 to the PCs.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:45.460]   And either at the same time or slightly before that,
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.420]   they were saying that Apple should turn around
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:49.180]   and make Windows PCs.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.620]   Merlin got on Night Nike Plus.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.580]   I just want to talk about something fun.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.580]   Well, it's inside--
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.220]   You're scaring all the--
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.380]   I had some girls wait a minute.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.700]   --the inside baseball stuff.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.660]   I had something fun here.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.540]   I had porn dominates video--
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.500]   We got Nike Plus.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.060]   We got porn dominates media.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.260]   We're going to finish it all up with some fun.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.060]   Yeah, you want to?
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.020]   Well, why don't you finish up--
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:08.820]   No, I just-- I know.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.460]   I just thought that was really--
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.380]   You got a Nike Plus.
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.140]   I got a Nike Plus.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.140]   And I just want to talk--
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:12.900]   Are you actually using it?
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.620]   Do you want it?
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.820]   Well, you're always talking about your damn workouts
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.540]   and how you're always with the workouts and the men.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.780]   Which is pretty funny because Merlin's
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:19.940]   in much better shape than I am.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.580]   I don't know if you guys can see this, but I am ripped.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.620]   Right now I have a shirtless.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.660]   And I can put--
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.620]   And I have--
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:24.980]   I have--
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.580]   Listening man nipples.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.060]   And I can put a mug of beer on my belly.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.900]   That's true.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.940]   I actually have a 9-pack.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.140]   It's--
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.340]   I have an extremely well-developed lower abdomen.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.420]   Get sliced cheese on it.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.540]   So you got this Nike--
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.740]   Yeah, yeah, this came through--
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:40.780]   The thing that goes on your shoe.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.660]   This is-- sorry?
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.820]   This is the thing that goes on your shoe.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.980]   This thing goes on your shoe.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.140]   And I just thought I'd mention it to you because I think
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.780]   it's something you might be actually kind of into looking at.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.380]   You know, if I put it on and I went to the gym,
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.820]   it would tell me that I went like four feet.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.940]   You were at the gym.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.740]   You went four feet.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.260]   This was provided through--
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.060]   I do the advertising on my site.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.020]   It's handled by my friends over at Federated Media.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.380]   And they--
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.740]   I mean, just in terms of disclosure,
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.980]   this is some stuff that Nike has sent some of the publishers
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:09.500]   to look at.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.340]   So they sent some shoes and an iPod and a little sensor
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.420]   thing, the iPod and Nike packed the try out.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.260]   And it's really fun.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.420]   It's so fun.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.940]   Does it keep a map of where you went?
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.780]   No, it doesn't.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.380]   OK, so this is the one thing that is--
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.820]   there are some stuff out there.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.860]   There's stuff out there that-- and if you have windows,
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.100]   apparently you have a lot more options for things
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.380]   like using GPS, where it will actually
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:36.020]   like track where you went.
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.740]   I mean, to go straight to the Karma Suck part,
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.140]   I do wish that there was an all-in-one unit that
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.780]   would handle all the things the different gadgets handle.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.380]   I wish there was something that would handle GPS plus heart
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.460]   rate, plus pedometer, plus the burn, all that stuff,
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.060]   and the playlists and all that kind of stuff,
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.500]   all in one place that works on a Mac.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.860]   I don't know of that if that exists.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.220]   But what they have put together is a pretty cool little package.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.300]   And I've only played with it just a little bit.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.660]   I'm somebody who is advancing in years.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.060]   And I've decided that I want to start walking and running more.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.940]   And so like a lot of people, I'm much more inclined
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.260]   to do something if there's a geeky tech factor associated
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260]   with it.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.540]   But no, I just thought I'd mention it,
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.140]   because it's something you might want to look at, too.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.220]   It's a lot of fun to set up.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.980]   You can go ahead and you calibrate it to the way
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.020]   that you walk.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.380]   You say, OK, well, I'm going to walk a quarter of a mile,
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.300]   and it will then calibrate it to whatever it might stub you
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:26.940]   the legs.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.460]   You've now walked a quarter of a mile.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.300]   This is the part that's neat.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.460]   The part that I was really skeptical about was thinking, OK,
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.300]   well, there's probably going to be some kind of Victoria
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.460]   robot voice that's going to pop in occasionally.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.980]   But it's totally laid back.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.020]   It plays a song.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.780]   And then occasionally, we'll bring the volume down
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.740]   to say, you're this far into your run.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.020]   You've got this much left to go.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:47.940]   I like it pretty well.
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.620]   I think it's got a lot of room to improve in order
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.300]   to bring in things like right now,
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.260]   I look like a freaking silon if I have all of the stuff
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.180]   that I want.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.180]   I would love to track what a pedometer says I did in terms
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.380]   of distance and burn, what heart monitor says I did
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.860]   in terms of tracking that stuff.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.780]   As well as the GPS stuff of where did I go.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:13.780]   And so nobody wants to run around with four devices on them.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.340]   So I think there's still an opportunity here.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:21.660]   I wonder if the wireless that the Nike Plus uses
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.460]   could work with more than one device.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.820]   If it has a capacitor, do that.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.980]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.220]   If you could have a hardware--
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.820]   If you could become almost like a hub,
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.500]   work it if you had other--
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.100]   So your pedometer could send information to the iPod as well.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.500]   Yeah, it could receive them both.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.740]   There's something about using this
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.860]   that makes it feel a little bit like an interesting experiment.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.540]   The fact that right now you go to a site--
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.180]   But the question is, will that be enough to sustain
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.020]   your six months into work?
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:48.420]   That's right.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.300]   And that's a really good question.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.540]   Or more importantly, for your inside baseball kind of crap,
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.700]   is this the kind of relationship that Apple is going
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:56.340]   to start having with outside companies?
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.340]   Because I don't know.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:02.460]   It seems like it benefits on the face of it.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:02.960]   Sorry?
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.580]   It's pretty innovative.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.500]   It is.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.740]   On the face of it, it seems like it probably
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.580]   benefits pound for pound benefits Nike
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.980]   more than it benefits Apple.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.300]   Because you've got to buy--
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.780]   You're encouraged to kind of buy these shoes.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.260]   But when you buy all the Nike stuff, then it's like, oh,
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.500]   now I have to buy those.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.420]   Well, they each get something out of it.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.740]   I mean, in my understanding of why iTunes is a quote,
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.460]   unquote, good thing for Apple, it's
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.180]   because it gets you coming back to the Apple place.
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.060]   You're using an Apple device.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.660]   And it becomes this life style-- your iPod increasingly
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.540]   is becoming this lifestyle hub in some ways, right?
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.740]   Well, I like it to become that.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:37.260]   It doesn't do it.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.460]   I think that's what it's trying to do.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.020]   And that's what I think that maybe we
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:44.780]   see with an iPhone or a new iPod.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.460]   But all these devices have the same dot connected.
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:48.460]   That's the cool thing.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.260]   Because we want to make a GPS one for the iPhone.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.460]   There's one-- you guys talk about something else,
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:52.980]   and I'll find it.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.100]   There was a thread on Metafilter in my research
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.020]   about this, where they talked about the difference
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.820]   between the--
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.980]   I can't do two things at once--
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.380]   comparing somebody saying, should I go out and buy--
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:07.700]   excuse me, should I buy a Nike Plus versus should I buy this GPS
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.140]   that I'm now forgetting?
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.540]   And the GPS one, which I'll look up, looks really cool.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.180]   It basically will track wherever you go.
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.340]   But it looks like it's mostly PC.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:21.100]   But if you're running, don't you know where you've been?
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.780]   Yes, but I think what the Nike Plus wants
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.940]   to be is--
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.420]   and it's funny, because anytime you get a new Apple product--
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.900]   It's tracking how far you go, right?
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.860]   It's tracking how far you go.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.420]   So if you haven't seen what it does,
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.500]   the basic functionality is that using your footfall,
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.780]   it tells you how far and how fast you run.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.460]   So it tracks-- as you're doing it,
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.060]   it's useful in the sense that it says, OK, here's your--
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.020]   you're running a this minute mile or what have you.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.540]   And then when you get home, it plugs into this website,
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.860]   where it tracks all your runs for you,
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.220]   and expresses it as a graph.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.900]   But it's the graph part that I like.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.660]   The graph part's neat.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.660]   I think that's very important.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.420]   I like the power song thing, where you put your button in it,
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.340]   go straight to your fairest rock song or whatever.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.140]   Yeah, the rocker.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.580]   But what it's interesting about that--
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.540]   I have that power song thing.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.100]   It's called the Lincoln Park.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.380]   CD.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.100]   But the reason I mentioned here is because, first of all,
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.060]   it is kind of cool, and I was excited to get it and play with it.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.900]   But I think it is interesting to think
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.380]   about what kinds of relationships like this might be intriguing
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.380]   to Apple and--
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.740]   Well, especially I think that once it starts
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.820]   being able to communicate with a lot more devices,
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.620]   if they had Wi-Fi or if they had Bluetooth--
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.020]   That's exactly right.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.500]   You could really have a lot of fun and just the connector.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.580]   The connector is fine, but I don't want to have a lot of connectors.
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.820]   And I don't want to have a lot of stuff.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.460]   What I want my iPod to do is be able to Bluetooth
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.740]   to a whole slew of different things.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.700]   And maybe that's one connector with a Bluetooth,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   and then it just--
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.380]   We should get my friend Adam Greenfield in here
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.180]   to talk about this.
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.940]   He's a big ubiquitous computing guy.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.700]   And I think what we're looking at here
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:56.780]   is the beginning of interesting consumer you become, to me.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.060]   Because the promise of this is that with the right kind of dongle
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.420]   hooked up to something as innocuous as your iPod,
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.700]   you start getting to do some really interesting things
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.940]   based on the data that it can send and transmit.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.780]   I mean, obviously we're all excited about the Zoom when we heard
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:13.180]   that it was going to have quote unquote "wireless."
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.340]   And then, of course, the version of wireless that you get is--
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.620]   I came out in this crop.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:18.700]   It makes you sad.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.180]   But I don't know.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.580]   As long as we're talking about all this speculative stuff,
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.460]   I just think that idea--
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:28.140]   getting so, so this is a wonderfully packaged,
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.540]   apple-centric product.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.540]   You get this thing.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.060]   You take it apart.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:31.660]   You plug it in.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.460]   It just works.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.140]   You literally plug it in and start walking.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.580]   And it was pretty accurate.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:38.260]   When I did my test walk to calibrate it,
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.220]   the quarter mile that I walked, it was 0.24 miles.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:44.700]   So out of the box, it was pretty accurate.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.500]   But I just think it's really intriguing
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.880]   to think about when you bring in something
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.060]   some of this wireless stuff.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.300]   And I don't know what it is.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.780]   I mean, there's obviously the fanciful stuff
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.140]   like it could be your BART card.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.660]   It could be this way of storing a point.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.940]   You could do your BART card, actually.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:08:59.580]   It wouldn't fit.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:00.420]   No, you just roll it over.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.660]   You have to have that one where you roll it over.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:01.900]   See, that's funny, Dan.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.100]   That's funny.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.860]   But some way, or it could be the key fob type activities.
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.420]   And as to why you would want that GPS, well,
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.860]   I think what they're trying to get at with a specific product
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:17.620]   is getting you more involved in your music as part of your workout
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.260]   and therefore bringing you emotionally closer
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.020]   to your relationship with iTunes.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.100]   And it's very-- you do stuff like it shows you.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.580]   When it shows you the run you did, it tells you what song with playlist
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.620]   you were listening to.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.820]   And so I think you're really encouraged.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.060]   There's a whole section of playlists that are all Nike Plus oriented.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.780]   I bought one.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:37.300]   Yeah, I bought the crystal method one.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.740]   I like to mix the crystal method one with the Lincoln Park and a little--
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.940]   But it's-- I don't know.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.420]   There's a biotech.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.460]   Guys, our age should be listening to something a little more--
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.020]   Stayed.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.340]   What should we listen to?
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.660]   The cure.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.100]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:56.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.740]   So how old are you?
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.140]   I am 33.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:00.900]   OK, wow.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.260]   Dan's the young in the--
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:03.940]   I'm not--
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.100]   We're close to the same age.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.020]   You're really younger than me.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.060]   I'm 36.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:08.780]   36?
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.780]   Yes.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.380]   So I'm not that--
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.940]   I'm just getting the oldest one in the room.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.140]   I just want to say I felt very old when I was in the Oakland airport,
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:21.780]   and they were playing a music version of the split ends.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:22.500]   What?
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.340]   They were playing a music--
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:23.860]   I got you.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.660]   I got you.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.220]   No, it wasn't.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:25.620]   It was like--
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.340]   Six months in a leaky boat.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.580]   Six months in a leaky boat.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.660]   Split ends, music.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.740]   And I literally, my lower back just started hurting.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.940]   I mean, it was just-- there was pain showing up.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.220]   I can't believe that--
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.940]   and I can't believe I can remember all the words.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.580]   Anyway, so porn still dominates video downloads.
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.580]   60% of all the downloads out there in the third quarter
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.700]   were adult film content.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.620]   20% was TV show content.
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.460]   This is according to Forbes, so it must be true.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.580]   And 5% was the mainstream movie content.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.460]   Pay downloads?
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:58.980]   Pay downloads?
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.820]   What kind of downloads?
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.700]   Pay downloads.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.020]   Does this include--
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.740]   They don't really keep track of that.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.660]   What they got into-- I've paid downloads.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.380]   They said 62% was TV content.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.380]   24% was music content.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.620]   6% was mainstream content, and they don't really figure out
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.380]   that doesn't really add up to 100%.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.500]   But we won't get into that.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.700]   But 90% of all paid downloads--
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.620]   non-porn, I assume--
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.820]   was from Apple computers, iTunes store.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.380]   Yikes.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.260]   So people are buying it.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.740]   They're buying it from Apple.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:28.940]   Per--
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.260]   Buy the hell out of it.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.260]   I buy a lot of stuff from Apple.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.620]   It's so funny when it seemed expensive when I first started.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.940]   And now I don't think about it.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.820]   I was making a mix that I wanted to make of just this.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.180]   I decided I got into this, like, I went down this rabbit hole.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.060]   I know you'd never think that I'd go down a rabbit hole.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:43.540]   You?
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.620]   Me.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.460]   I went down a musical rabbit hole.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:47.660]   I don't see it.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.580]   And I decided that I wanted all these songs.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.780]   And I just want them to be--
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.700]   iTunes just went click, click, click, click.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.940]   And I bought like eight songs.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.060]   This is why I think Apple should start selling wine.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.260]   Because I'm pretty sure that their alcohol definitely
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.140]   has a component in this.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:05.900]   My finger gets a lot more loose around 10 or 11.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.900]   And--
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   Cure box set.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   Sounds great.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   What was I thinking?
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   It's only $40.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.260]   So-- but I do think that it is something that-- culturally--
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.100]   and I think this is what the music industry has to pay attention
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.060]   to and what the movie industry has to pay attention to,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.860]   is that culturally it becomes easier and easier for some of us
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.860]   to actually buy.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.860]   I have an observation.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.660]   And I don't know.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:27.980]   I'm curious if this--
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.540]   and I'll reveal just a little bit about myself here.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:36.100]   I have a ad hoc cascade of media location
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.540]   that I will go through.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.820]   And iTunes definitely has a place in that.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:45.540]   If there is ways that I can get media in less costly ways,
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.820]   that will sometimes be the first place that I will look.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.740]   And if it's not there, I'll go to certain other means,
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.740]   and so on and so on.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.660]   But I got to tell you, a lot of the times,
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.940]   I end up at the iTunes store and I end up
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.140]   putting a quarter in the meter.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.020]   No question about it.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.060]   Now, what does that mean?
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.460]   Obviously, that means that I don't want to spend money,
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.660]   if I don't have to, maybe.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.180]   But what it also says to me, it's a point
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.020]   I just cannot get away from, which
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.820]   is that it's a very healthy habit for media companies
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.100]   to get us into the habit of getting stuff off the end.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.580]   And I find it for me.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.180]   I got to be at the iTunes store.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.140]   I'm saying, it's the point that I'm
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.580]   trying to make that might open me to litigation,
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.900]   is that I don't think I would be such an enthusiastic iTunes
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.500]   buyer if I didn't first have this legacy of somebody who
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.660]   had spent five years finding it through other means.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.300]   I think that completely trained me to be somebody
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:36.180]   who learned to think about getting media in terms
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.140]   of instant gratification.
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:41.620]   And finding a way to put a cash register on that.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.660]   And I have to admit, I go to iTunes first,
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.260]   because I just don't want to bother.
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:46.420]   I just go straight to iTunes.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.260]   I'll tell you what.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.100]   I'll tell you something.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.660]   If I don't find the song on iTunes,
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.660]   I'm not going to the record store to find it.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.500]   That's the thing.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.020]   Now, I'll start looking around.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:54.860]   I don't know what it is.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.860]   If it didn't have the DRM, I would probably
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.380]   be buying three times as much.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.180]   I have no problem price at all.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.300]   I got to tell you, it drives me a little bit crazy.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.620]   The DRM cuts my consumption down probably
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.580]   to 1/5 of what it would normally be.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:12.860]   I get more devices in my life and as hard drives crash
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.940]   and all that stuff.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:15.860]   I just don't want to have to deal with that.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.100]   But I guess I just think that that is a habit to help.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.540]   It doesn't have a effect on whether you'd
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.420]   lose your files if it's crashed or not.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.980]   If you lose the copy you've downloaded,
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:28.300]   you don't get to download it again from the iTunes store.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.500]   Unless you're Leo.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.060]   Well, first of all, yes, you can't actually.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.260]   You just give them a hard luck story and they do--
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.500]   Have you done that?
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:34.780]   Really.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.460]   Leo says he did that too.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.500]   Did you use Leo's name to do that?
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.700]   No.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.980]   No, they probably wouldn't believe me.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.060]   But yeah, if you lose your files,
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.180]   you just call and try until they give it, let you download it.
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.420]   And they tell you that you can't probably ever
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.260]   do it for another year.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.660]   And then six months later, you could do it again.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.060]   But I mean, obviously the reason why--
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.780]   That's not official.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.380]   Well, it's--
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.740]   They don't want everybody doing that.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.900]   The reason they don't want everyone to do it
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.740]   is because they've sold two--
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.060]   Because the labels would lose there.
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.260]   A billion and a half tracks, whatever.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.580]   Can you imagine if Apple just had to have the reserve
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.540]   to allow everyone to download their--
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.420]   Do they have to pay--
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.340]   Do you know how they have to pay again when you download it?
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.420]   So we have theories about this.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:12.900]   We had a whole--
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.380]   We had a whole--
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.220]   We had a whole lot.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.780]   I don't think it would be--
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.940]   Because we were saying--
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.540]   Alex and I and the rest of us were saying that we
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.660]   think it would be really smart for them to basically hold
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:26.380]   this in perpetuity, all up, the MP3, locker, back in the day,
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.740]   where you can come back and from any licensed Mac,
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.500]   any-- well, I don't know what the terminology is.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.660]   But you should be able to download--
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.260]   If I'm in a hotel room, but somewhere,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.220]   I should be able to re-download my stuff.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.740]   But if you think about the problem,
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.900]   they've sold a billion and a half tracks.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.260]   The hardware infrastructure to be prepared to re-download
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.460]   those billion and a half tracks at any given point,
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.580]   that's a lot of--
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.420]   I think Apple--
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.620]   They're shipping a lot of data.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:55.460]   And they have their systems tuned to the point where they're--
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.140]   they don't have--
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.900]   I mean, it doesn't make sense to have a lot of access
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.340]   to capacity to sitting around doing nothing.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.820]   So if they allowed anyone to just download anything
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.540]   at any point in the future, they would
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.340]   have to maintain the capacity to do that, or face surges.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:11.620]   I just keep thinking about that.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:14.180]   Anything-- they say that, for example, with gift cards,
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.300]   there's a thing on NPR today about gift cards
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.220]   and how-- what a boon gift cards have been for all
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.300]   these different stores.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.900]   Because they said one of the things is, what do they call it?
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.620]   Lyft?
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.380]   The amount that-- I forget what the term they use is.
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.740]   But people, if you give somebody a gift card,
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:30.060]   they tend to come in and spend 50% on top of whatever
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.020]   the value the gift card was.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.300]   And this is the whole reason why I mentioned before,
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.820]   the girl I knew who worked at the Limited.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.500]   And they made deliberately crappy clothes
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.380]   so that people would return them and then buy more.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.380]   And you always--
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.580]   They had this very--
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.260]   I just want to say that the pair of pants
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.820]   that I'm wearing today is too big.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.820]   For the Limited?
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.820]   I bought them from the Gap.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.260]   Lots of pants?
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.260]   No, I bought the pants.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.380]   And they're just a little too big.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.500]   I got them a slightly size bigger,
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.420]   but then they should have got them a size smaller.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.700]   And 29 waste.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.820]   And so I decided that-- yeah, right.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.100]   One day it was that.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.180]   So when I was 12--
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:10.940]   so I went into the Gap today to return the pants.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:14.540]   And I bought four other pairs of pants.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.220]   Precisely.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:16.420]   And so, yes, you're absolutely right.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:19.900]   I think-- so the theory that we had was that Apple would love
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.860]   to be able to do that, but the labels that they've probably--
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.740]   we were assuming-- do you have any information on this?
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.020]   We're assuming that they've got to pay the label every time
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.180]   something gets downloaded.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:30.820]   How would the labels know if the Apple's along
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.660]   people to download stuff from their software?
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.260]   Auditing.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.220]   Oh, spare.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:34.740]   Auditing.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.060]   They don't use Windows.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.100]   I'm sure that--
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.860]   And they may have some kind of agreement
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.660]   with the record companies that this is within reason
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.780]   that they let people download it if they--
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.980]   All right, but I mean, clearly, Apple would have a--
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:49.060]   have a separate bucket of things they've given away for free
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.900]   and things that they've downloaded twice and things
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.380]   that actually sold.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.020]   I just think--
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.860]   Any time you get people-- it's just back--
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.460]   there's a reason I'm not in the corner office.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.660]   I don't have the business document.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.220]   But it just seems to me, anytime you get people
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.860]   coming to your site and doing stuff and interacting,
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.860]   like it to become your lifestyle hub.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:04.740]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.820]   I think having-- that's a major genius part
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.300]   of having the iTunes store integrated right into iTunes.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.100]   So it's right there.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.540]   And obviously, they're working that
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.820]   by the thing they just introduced
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:22.100]   while just a year ago, suggesting other songs that when
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.500]   you play a song, the little mini store comes up and says,
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.100]   hey, go to our store and buy some more stuff.
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:27.740]   I don't do that.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.580]   Do you actually use that?
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.420]   I turned mine off.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.580]   I thought it was freaking me out.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.420]   But I mean, that's the point.
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:32.420]   And that's why it's there.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.100]   It's like you're saying to get you back in the store.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.260]   Actually, I just don't-- I'm not willing to--
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.140]   when I buy stuff from iTunes, I know I want it.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.060]   It's very rare for me to experiment.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.980]   Yeah, I don't browse very often.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.100]   We talked a little bit before the show.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.820]   We were talking about-- when we were mentioning your porn
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:51.020]   video story, just this kind of like the lessons
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:53.540]   that you can learn, though, from just the whole idea
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.740]   of the way most--
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.820]   Well, I mean, that's the--
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.740]   Most people will tell you.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.100]   And to be honest with you, I don't
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.140]   know how the whole business end of porn works.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.620]   But most people will tell you-- most analysts
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.180]   will tell you that if you want to see someone who's
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.460]   done an organization or a group of organizations that
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.740]   have figured out how to make money with content
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.420]   and figured out how to drive people
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.340]   towards pain for it, porn is the--
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:17.300]   they're the best in the world at what they do.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:17.900]   You know what I mean?
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.020]   Yeah, that's where the money is.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.060]   But the thing--
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.060]   And then it drives the information.
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.340]   To a certain extent, every company
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.580]   understands their audience.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:26.220]   But it just seems to me that there aren't many industries
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.300]   that understand their audience.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.100]   The core interests of their audience
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.740]   better than the people who are selling porn.
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.460]   They're not only producers, they're customers.
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.180]   But I mean, understanding--
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:36.820]   But that's--
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.540]   But that's because the built-in demand is there.
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.300]   I mean, people--
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.980]   But there's built-in demand for content.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.220]   Porn is one type of content.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.020]   But there's built-in demand for all kinds of content.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:45.860]   But you got to be--
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.300]   It's got to be--
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.300]   It's got to be--
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.500]   It's not available everywhere.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.100]   It's like alcohol in states outside of ours,
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.300]   where you have to go to a specific store to get--
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.300]   Oh, that's good.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.340]   You have to go there to get it.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:55.860]   Yeah, right.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.700]   In North Carolina.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:57.700]   Pittsburgh.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.580]   So they can change how the market works.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.660]   But I think the more that you can get that idea in your head
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.220]   though of being able to service people when they want it.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.300]   Well, and figure out how do you give them a little bit,
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.420]   and then a little bit more, and then a little bit more,
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.980]   and then say, OK, now if you want more,
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.500]   you're going to have to pay for it now.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.420]   And that's something that--
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.820]   And I'll be honest with you, that's what we do with--
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:18.420]   I mean, with DV Garage, that's what we did for a long time.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:22.140]   I'd show up on tech TV, and I'd say,
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.460]   I just show something for free.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.460]   It's really easy to go.
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.260]   And I'd say, you know what?
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.780]   If you want to see more of this, this is the seven-minute
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.060]   version.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.340]   If you want to see the 20-minute version,
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.740]   go to dvgarage.com.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.780]   And somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 people a week
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.420]   would go to dvgarage.com, and they'd download that video,
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.260]   and they'd leave me their email.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.340]   And then when I released a product,
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:44.540]   I'd say, hey, oh, by the way, to the now 50,000 to 80,000 people,
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.340]   depending on what time of the year.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.140]   By the way, I released the Photoshop product.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.140]   And that's all I did.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.060]   That's all I did.
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.060]   You've got to put enough of a sample outside the pay wall
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.820]   that people can make an informed decision about whether it's
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.500]   something that they--
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.020]   Absolutely.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:20:59.540]   --want.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:02.340]   That's why I like-- for example, I think, traditionally,
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:06.660]   if somebody had made the iTunes store, say, whatever,
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.740]   five years ago, they probably would have
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:14.220]   had a low-quality full download track of one song
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.340]   from each album.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:16.260]   You know what I mean?
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.860]   I love the idea that you can go in on iTunes
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:19.860]   and listen to 30 seconds.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.420]   I still think the winning formula to me is still--
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.340]   you can download anything you want at 96-bit.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:31.340]   And 256-bit is 99 cents.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.020]   And so you have the subscription model.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.340]   I'll pay 20 bucks a month to Apple,
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.300]   and you get 96-bit of all you want.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.220]   If you want to keep that song forever,
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.500]   you pay a buck for a 256-bit one, which is higher than--
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.540]   so you spread that out.
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.020]   So the 128 is just kind of this--
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.020]   I think that 128 is kind of this evil middle, where it's
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:50.900]   really not that great.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:52.220]   And that's the other reason I don't buy stuff.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.060]   I'd like to buy CDs if I really want it.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:54.980]   It doesn't sound that good.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.260]   It's not that small.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.780]   So let me pay-- if I'm paying for something,
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:03.180]   I'll pay for a 256 download or a 192 download,
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.300]   which would be considerably better than the 128.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.340]   So I'll pay for that.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:11.780]   And then let me pay you 20 bucks a month to have 96-bit all I want.
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:13.980]   So I can sit there and play and listen to playlists,
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.340]   and listen to how my workout mixes.
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.260]   So not the zoom like a push.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.740]   But it's a cross-section of it.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:19.260]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:19.980]   And it is.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:23.020]   But I think that I have to admit, I'm actually
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.660]   looking at going to buy an MP3 player that
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:28.100]   lets me do play with some of the other services,
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.700]   because I kind of want the subscription model.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.420]   I kind of want to go, you know, I feel like this for a workout.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:33.940]   And I'm going to go through 500,000 songs.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.060]   I'm just going to fill it up.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.780]   I don't necessarily want to buy all that stuff.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.620]   I don't want to own it all.
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.300]   I just want to have it for the next three weeks, you know?
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.620]   And then I'm going to get tired and move to another workout mix.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:42.820]   You know?
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:45.300]   And so I think that I think Apple needs to--
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.020]   because I think people didn't like it at first.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.500]   But I think people are starting to warm to it.
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.260]   The longer these subscription models are out there,
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.740]   they're starting to realize that they may not actually
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.460]   want to own everything.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:57.380]   But the subscription models aren't working.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.740]   They're not doing it as well.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.700]   Not making money, me?
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.180]   They're not working as well.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:05.020]   But Apple had a huge head start, and Apple
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.220]   has a huge closed system.
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.020]   So there's a lot of things that make the Apple solution work.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:11.980]   I think head starts overrated.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.500]   I mean, there's something to a head start.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:19.260]   But we've had place for sure since 2004,
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.460]   and it's dramatically failed over the last three years.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:24.940]   And there just isn't a huge market for--
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.380]   I mean, there's people who talk about it.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:27.620]   And yeah, it sounds kind of good.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.700]   But there's other kind of angles to it
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:36.020]   that to really do place for sure in a mobile device,
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.060]   you have to do what Microsoft did and put all the DRM
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.180]   in the device.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.660]   So the device is doing all this work
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.700]   and making sure that, oh, it's in the month,
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:45.940]   you can't listen to this anymore and shut you off.
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.020]   You can't do that on the iPod.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.020]   It doesn't have the technology to do that.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:49.520]   Right.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.580]   It's just simple advice.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.940]   It also makes the iPod a simpler device.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   And so it's not like a A or B. It's kind of like a--
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:02.420]   do you want to do this kind of simple market that
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.140]   works in one way?
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.820]   I mean, to be honest with you, with the subscription.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.540]   The subscription thing, 96-bit, you could really just
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.540]   let people have them.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:12.340]   I mean, if you really like the song, you're going to buy it.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.500]   96-bit, or you could decide maybe it's 64-bit.
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.940]   That would be the situation.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.500]   So end of show.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.220]   Do you have a pick?
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.460]   I got a pick.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:25.140]   I got a pick that I am extremely excited about.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.300]   I occasionally write things.
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:30.060]   Everyone's one.
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.100]   I have a occasion to write things.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.420]   And I was told about this actually oddly enough
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:38.220]   by a guy that was interviewing me for an article
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.380]   for the Financial Times.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:42.980]   And every time I end up getting interviewed
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:45.460]   by another Mac Geek, we spend the same amount of time
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:48.140]   that we had during the interview talking shop afterward.
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:51.140]   And this guy's something about a fantastic application
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:52.860]   called Scrivener.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.500]   And Scrivener, S-C-R-I-V-E-N-E-R, which I'm going to go
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.060]   hit on the Google right now.
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.700]   I think it's literature in latte is the name of the site.
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.740]   Yeah, literatureandlatte.com.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.420]   Scrivener is a writing app that pulls together
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.820]   a lot of the stuff that you normally
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:10.460]   have to go to a few different apps for.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.900]   It's one of the things I love about it.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:16.220]   It's very-- so when you're building sections inside of Scrivener,
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.260]   and that could be chapters, it could be paragraphs,
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.820]   it could be whatever, each one of these
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.500]   can be their own little atomic sub-document.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.420]   And each little document inside of there
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:27.140]   gets its own index card with its own synopsis.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:30.020]   All the index cards can be moved around on a cork board.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.220]   And all of those sections stay associated
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:34.180]   with that index card and that synopsis.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:36.780]   Index cards can have sub-index cards and so on.
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.340]   So anyway, it's this very intuitive way to capture.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.660]   If you're like me, and you sometimes
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.860]   like to start with a brain dump, and then move everything
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:45.020]   around, and then figure out what that means,
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.340]   you're actually doing the writing as you're doing
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.020]   the brainstorming.
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.540]   Because anything that you've got now
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.740]   becomes the basis for whatever you want to write.
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:53.620]   There's a ton of stuff to go into with this app.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.340]   So I won't go all the way through it.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:00.020]   But it does include a really nice full screen mode.
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.580]   It can output to a variety of different formats.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.380]   I love the fact that you can, for example,
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.580]   write in any typeface and formatting style that you like.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.540]   And whatever style you choose for output
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:12.900]   is completely separate.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.060]   So it's a very smart kind of, I don't
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.620]   want to say almost object-oriented way to write.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:20.460]   And whatever your style of writing is,
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.460]   Scrivener will accommodate the way
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.620]   that you think about the process.
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.540]   You're not hemmed into one way of doing that.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.740]   So if you've been using, for example,
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.580]   I don't want to say you don't need Devin
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.420]   or you don't need your Jimbo.
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.740]   But if you've been thinking in a way
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.660]   where you want to pull lots of scraps of stuff in,
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.020]   photographs, web pages, you can do all that inside of here,
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:39.660]   move it all around as file cards,
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.820]   and then turn it into a draft.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.780]   OK, I'm going to check that out.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:43.820]   I'm literally sure in latte.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.020]   So that comes.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:45.340]   Sounds good.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.860]   How much is it?
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.220]   I don't think it's for sale yet.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.540]   This developer seems really cool.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.700]   Is it like an open beta?
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.820]   It's an open-- it's a demo that runs into January.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.300]   I saw someone with the cost was it.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.140]   It's escaping me now.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.540]   But the developer is very responsive to suggestion.
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.340]   It has a very lively forum associated with it.
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:03.660]   Lots of good tips and tricks.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.940]   And it's another-- like so many of the apps that I love,
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:09.300]   it doesn't reveal itself to you in the first five minutes.
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.420]   It takes a little bit of time to noodle around with it.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:16.460]   But-- and finally, unlike a lot of applications
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.340]   that seem initially wizzy, I don't think this
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.860]   is a pure time sink.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.620]   It isn't just a place to fiddle.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.620]   And if you're like me and you have distraction problems
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.460]   and need the big, nerf football sized riddle,
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:29.140]   and that's a good thing.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.140]   Do you have one?
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:30.660]   Dan?
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:33.940]   No, I wasn't aware that I could pick something.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.780]   What's your killer app, Dan?
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.740]   What's your favorite app?
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.700]   What is my killer app?
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.060]   Actually, like where were you?
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.860]   We surprised Dan just so you know.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.420]   I asked Dan late last week.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.700]   The virtual blanket party.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.300]   Yeah, we did.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.500]   Come on over here.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.540]   And he came over and then we were like, oh, by the way,
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.660]   you have to tell everyone what you love.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:50.020]   And you have to come up with one real good one.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.580]   So what's the matter that you're excited about?
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.060]   Let's see.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.300]   Well, something that I've been using a lot lately,
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.260]   just as a very simple app, is called Mass Replace It.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.420]   I was looking around for it.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:03.780]   I couldn't find it and I stumbled across it.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.300]   And it's like, did exactly what it does.
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:10.860]   It lets you kind of brainlessly pick out either within a file
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.180]   or a series of files.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:18.660]   You can do find or replace either on the names of items
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.820]   or contents or anything like that.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.700]   I use that a lot.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:28.100]   Mass Replace It is at hexmonkeysoftware.com.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.820]   Alex, do you have a pick?
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:32.100]   The one I think we've gotten to the end of my pick
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.180]   because I'm not a very interesting Mac user.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.180]   You know, I actually-- I use like four apps all the time.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.340]   Also, everything you use costs $799.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:38.840]   I know.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.620]   I'm trying to think of something that was like,
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:42.220]   where it's laughing and everything.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.300]   Everything that Merlin has is either free or shareware
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.100]   and everything that Alex has is like--
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.340]   Proprietary video software of four figures.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:50.580]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.580]   So the thing that I am playing with,
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.420]   we talked about a little bit earlier in the show,
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.980]   that I'm interested in is the Zudio,
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.100]   you know, this new, zerias thing that I've been playing with.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.060]   So it is a-- the ability-- you know, the BBC
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.820]   is going to be putting content onto it.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:10.060]   It uses the bit torrent backend, the peer-to-peer backend,
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:13.500]   to let you move files around and download these big HD files.
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.940]   Democracy also does it.
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.540]   We've already talked about Democracy in the past.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.540]   The Zudio is brand new.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.180]   It's still in beta.
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.180]   It's a little funky.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:22.420]   But I wouldn't say that it has the interface
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.620]   that I like as much as democracy,
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.940]   but I also find I'm afraid of democracy,
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.340]   because it really does everything so automatically
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.700]   that sometimes I fill up my hard drive
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.540]   and shut down the system.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:33.460]   Democracy will fill your hard drive real fast.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.220]   Really fast.
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.700]   You subscribe to something, you know, again--
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.420]   Suddenly you're like, boom.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.700]   If you're having a little bit of eye-line,
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.940]   and you start subscribing to lots of stuff.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.220]   So the-- so anyway, Zudio is something
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.460]   that's worth checking out.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:50.140]   I think that it'd be fun to have a lot of people up there.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.500]   I'm playing with it and, you know,
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.340]   let us know what you think.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:58.860]   As always, let us know what you think at twit.tv
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.060]   in the Macbreak Weekly section.
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:01.900]   We've got some great discussions building there.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.260]   A lot of people have been participating,
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.540]   especially those who actually made it
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.020]   through the entire show, which this show is really--
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.220]   This is a long-ass show.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.220]   I don't know how it got so long.
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:11.700]   Can we put in a plug for our friend Dustin,
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.460]   who has been keeping a record of all the applications
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.460]   that we talk about on this show?
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:16.260]   Dustin is the man.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.100]   Dustin is the man.
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.620]   It's-- I don't know how to pronounce this.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.940]   Is it the suitin?
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:23.100]   D-A-S-U-T-I-N.com.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:27.820]   And this young gentleman is doing a wonderful,
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.380]   hopeful thing for us, which is every time we talk about these
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:32.820]   apps at the end of the show, he provides links.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:35.340]   You can go all the way back to episode six
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:36.620]   and talking about Little Snitch--
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:38.020]   Oh, the good old days.
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:39.860]   Episode six through 20, they're all here.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.620]   And going forward, he's going to keep doing this.
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:44.300]   So d-A-S-U-T-I-N.com.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.340]   And you can go in and see these apps that we talk about
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:47.700]   every time.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.660]   And we really appreciate him doing that for us.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.140]   And we really appreciate-- it really does make a difference,
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.100]   even though we don't respond to everything that people put up
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:57.300]   in the twit.tv and in the Mac break weekly section.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.300]   It really does make a difference.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.380]   I read everything.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:00.060]   It goes in there.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.100]   And I really take it as a--
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.020]   you know, I don't know what you think about doing this.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.740]   We just think about doing that.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:09.020]   And so I've definitely come up and let us know what you think.
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:13.660]   And hopefully we'll see a lot of you guys in a couple weeks.
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:14.900]   We've only got one more week.
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.260]   I think next week will be mostly us prepping
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:20.780]   and getting ready for the Big Mac world.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.700]   And I think it's going to be--
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.660]   who knows?
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.620]   I think it could be one of the more exciting Mac worlds.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.940]   In both the events, two of the events
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:30.540]   you talked about, the us appearing at the Apple Store
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:34.100]   for Mac break weekly, and also the podcaster thing
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.420]   at the Apple Store on Thursday.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.060]   Both of them have kind of meet up events afterwards.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.500]   So if you want to hang out and say hi,
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.060]   that's a good chance to come out and--
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.060]   It's a big social event, yeah.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.340]   --and keep it on t-shirts and bumper stickers.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:43.900]   No, we're not.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.660]   But we should.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.940]   We should get t-shirts and bumper stickers.
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.140]   We're going to give away stuff.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.220]   I don't know what it is, but really--
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.260]   I promise that we will give away--
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.940]   We talk a lot about this kind of stuff,
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.820]   but are we actually going to make stuff?
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:58.500]   I will give away more than $2,000 worth of goodies
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.580]   on Tuesday at six o'clock.
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:02.060]   Now what?
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.900]   Now, is this going to be one of your retail value
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:04.940]   kind of DVD courses?
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.740]   Or are you going to give away actual physical stuff?
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:07.940]   No, it'll be my retail DVD courses.
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.900]   No, we've got lots of training in the DVD garage.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:16.380]   And so I'm going to be giving away lots of costly advice.
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.820]   No, Merlin, no, no.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:22.860]   We have software, and we have training within the DVD garage.
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.060]   And then we have the PIXCore, which
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.860]   will give away some free memberships.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:26.420]   And then we'll--
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.460]   It's got to be given away iPhones, too.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.220]   And I'll see if I can find--
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:30.580]   It's us, hopefully.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.340]   I will personally buy you an iPhone.
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.500]   And then I'm going to see if I can
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.460]   scare up some software from a couple other companies.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.660]   And so we'll have some chocchikis to give away.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.740]   And Leo usually comes with pocket protectors and toothbrushes.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.940]   So he's got toothbrushes.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.620]   Have you got any toothbrushes?
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.620]   Never got a toothbrush.
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.300]   I have a toothbrush somewhere.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.500]   So I travel with it.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.540]   It makes me feel very smart.
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:54.020]   Anyway, Dan, thanks for stopping by.
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.900]   Thanks for having me.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.460]   Joining our insanity.
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.460]   And it was good to have you.
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:04.100]   And you can read more of Dan's musings at roughly drafted.com.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.260]   So definitely check that out.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.740]   Merlin, man.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.780]   Thanks for coming.
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.020]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:11.500]   It's always a delight.
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.260]   And I have a new ending.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:16.900]   Oh, this was suggested actually on the tweet.tv
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.380]   on the Mac break section.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:22.180]   Break time is over.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:22.700]   I like that.
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.180]   Do you like that?
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:23.700]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.460]   So this is Alex Lindsey.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.020]   You've been listening to Mac Break Weekly.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.540]   Break time is over.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.380]   There we go.
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.300]   That's good.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.860]   I don't think we need to do an after show,
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:32.820]   because the whole show was--
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.940]   That was like 2 and 1/2 hours.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.060]   In fact, I think I should cut some of the after show.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.420]   And I think I might cut some of the real show
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.060]   into the after show, most of the stuff that I talk about.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.020]   That was a long show.
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:42.860]   It was a long show.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.380]   I think if I actually cut it and people
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.860]   are going to listen to it now, and I'm going to try to wonder
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.660]   what was in the after show and what was in the real show,
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.980]   because I'm going to move things around a little bit.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:50.460]   Right.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.380]   We got a nice clean recording.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:52.860]   I can kind of have some fun with it,
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.860]   because I think we need to shorten the real show to something
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.980]   that's shorter than what we actually recorded.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:00.980]   There was that park where you talked about when you were in Cuba,
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:03.460]   and you saw that show with the woman in the horse.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.260]   I would cut out that entire section.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:07.180]   Because that's--
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:07.660]   You know, I'm going to--
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.260]   Might offend.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.660]   But well, it's two things.
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.060]   It's two things.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.980]   First of all, you shouldn't really be going to Cuba.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:12.500]   OK.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:15.100]   And second, it's a Mac show.
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:15.540]   So--
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.860]   It's really having to do with it.
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.300]   It's not directly related to Macs.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.420]   If she was f*cking the horse while she was using a Mac,
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.740]   that would be cool.
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.100]   I can't see that.
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:25.180]   I'll think about it.
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:26.220]   I'll think about it.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:27.860]   I think I might cut that out, and I think
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:29.900]   that using your Mac on Mars, I think
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.020]   we're going to cut that whole thing.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.660]   The Mac on Mars part is just--
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.180]   It wasn't that far out.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:35.980]   Like, I got it.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.980]   We were talking about that stuff, but I don't think that's really--
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.060]   I don't think we really need to do that.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.300]   I had a lot of allergy medicine before I came here tonight.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:45.020]   So I'm not really firing out all cylinders.
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.820]   And so I think we'll cut those things out, too.
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:48.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:49.120]   OK.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.220]   I'm going to turn off the recording.
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:51.900]   I wish you would.
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:55.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.420]   (upbeat music)
