[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.400]   With our fabulous hosts, Renee Ricci is here from Saint-Vietter Bagels in Montreal.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.320]   I wish. I wish. It's good to see you Renee. How is everything on your end of the world? Is it cold
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.200]   up there? Yeah, it's getting cold, but luckily we have those Saint-Vietter bagels and they're unique.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.440]   Well, both Saint-Vietter and a fair amount have an exception where they're allowed to still use a
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.720]   traditional wood-burning ovens to make their bagels. I was actually concerned about that because
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.600]   last year there was some commotion from the Montreal city government saying they were going to ban this.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   So they didn't. No, not so far. They have at least a modicum of respect for the history with which
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.760]   they pretend to oppress us. In order to offset their carbon neutrality, I have actually purchased
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.280]   a wood-pellet pizza oven. So I can make big books. Of course you did.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.800]   The most smoking on the show every week is going to save you a fortune in backyard barbecue money.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.400]   It smokes like a mofo. That's Andy Inaco laughing in the background. It's good to see you, Andrew.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.560]   He's wearing his Canadian teapot hat. My picks are a render man from the former trade show when
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   they had the show in Canada. It's got a maple leaf. This is one of my favorite hats and I have to
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   sort of not wear it out anymore because I don't want to wear it out. It's starting to wear out,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.640]   but that's part of the show. Well, I've made this Macworld 2002 shirt.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.960]   Holy cow. This is what we're talking about. You take care of your clothes, you invest in high quality
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.280]   stuff that you buy at the souvenir store. But he's vintage today. Also filling in.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.440]   Of course, for those of you who don't know, Lori Gill took a job with the fruit company.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.560]   Dang it. So we've had an empty seat last week as Merlin Man. I'm thrilled to have Rosemary Orchard
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.160]   on this week. Hi. Hello from, I want to say Oxford.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.440]   No, no, I'm just outside of Bristol. I left the fight that I'm currently showing up as
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.720]   Merlin Man because I got to talk to him just a couple of weeks ago. So it's great. I'm
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   stealing the name I'm running with. That was all done automatically. I apologize. Let's get
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.600]   here. Lower third, right? You are not. That's all right. Andy was me. So, you know, we'll just
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.440]   trade until eventually at some point. It's going to be 90s lower Thursday. Rosemary Orchard.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.240]   Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. It's something something's gone horribly wrong. I mean,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.680]   I think we should just go with it's a Christmas joke slash miracle. And you know, there's going
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.240]   to be more magic as the show goes on. There we go. Quickly, I should try to see if I get a car
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.320]   loan before the lower third goes away. But I've got ID. See my lower third? Exactly.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.760]   So can I just say that I'm very pleased and proud. This is the first streaming show I'm doing
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:02.000]   with my brand new Mac M1 Mac book. Oh, congratulations. Exactly. So now I'm not afraid to have one,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.720]   two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight Chrome tabs open at the same time. We're
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.560]   asking the on the 2012 Mac mini. It was like, let's see if we can have Skype open and a notepad.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.320]   This is nice. That's great. Are you using the camera? They're both in camera?
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.440]   No, no, no. This is this is the same Brio camera. It's using the previous one. One of the
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.680]   reasons why that's kind of prompted. I don't want to wait until next year was that I bought
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.960]   this really swell camera. Actually, before they before the pandemic, so before they got scarce,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   and then found out that no, my 20, my 20, neither my 2015 MacBook Pro nor my 2012 Mac mini
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.560]   or had enough like to even just deal with 4k input, let alone transcode and get to the HD
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.720]   output. So I'm finally able to actually use it to its full event. I'm the happiest boy in
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   puppet land right now. You know, who's not poor Rosemary still on an old Intel Mac. Am I right,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   Rosemary? You are right, but I'm using the same camera as Andy. So I'm going to go with
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.280]   a liberal win. You look great. And you got Christmas lights, which really adds to the
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.000]   festival. Well, I had a little bit of time before the show and thought why not decorate for this
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.120]   event. Are those those twinkle lights twinkly lights or? No, those are my tree, which is in
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.080]   the next room. I didn't want anything too crazy in here. These are just USB powered lights actually.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.160]   Oh, well, so they got some cheap romantic. There's a tech angle there. Yeah.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.880]   So today, yesterday, I guess it was we got iOS 14.3. We got watch,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:47.120]   OS 7.2. We got Big Sur 11.1 Apple TV. I don't know what the number is. Got new app. We got
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.720]   everything updated. The big update for iOS and Apple TV was really about fit. Well, no, I can't
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.320]   even say that was partly about fitness plus, which came out yesterday. Has anybody done any workouts
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.200]   on fitness? Sorry. Why are you laughing?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.720]   Need your reaction with that so that's if I'm doing workouts. I'm you're not doing workouts.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.120]   Yeah, I ran into the unfortunate box that some people are experiencing where if you
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.840]   try to sign up and you do have a series six Apple Watch, which is right here complete with my
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.200]   lovely plums solo loop. It doesn't offer you the three months free that you're supposed to get.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.600]   You're supposed to get one month. And so there's a couple of ways around that. You could
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.400]   Imperial Watch and repair it. But I figured that I'm just going to wait.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.160]   Projects. That's not that's a nice. I mean, it only takes about 15 minutes,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.440]   but then it takes three days for all the other apps to finish installing.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.240]   Yeah, so I decided I'm just going to hang on. And if it doesn't fix itself tomorrow,
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.920]   then I'll chat with Apple support nicely and see if they can sort that out for me.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.680]   I wasn't too worried about it because I bought Apple one when that became available. And that's
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.800]   part of the Apple one. So now I'm getting the full value of my Apple one subscription.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.200]   I'm very impressed. We showed it off earlier today on iOS today.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.080]   Mike and I did a few about 30 seconds of a dance workout.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:21.680]   But I'm really impressed. I mean, I've had a peloton, which has the same notion. It's a spin
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.760]   bike with a big screen on it and instructors in the remote studio are doing both live and recorded
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   things. I don't think any of the Apple TV, I mean, the fitness plus stuff is live as far as I can tell.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   But it's similar feeling you're watching ever exercise studio. There's three people. There's
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.640]   the instructor somebody doing it kind of light somebody doing a medium and then the
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.840]   instructor is doing it hard. So you can choose a level based on your fitness.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.040]   The watch display goes up on the screen, which is great shows your heart rate shows calorie burn,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.120]   shows your ring closing. I think and it's 10 bucks a month. I think Apple's going to do quite well
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.960]   with this. This is a lot cheaper than a gym membership. And if you know, they've got plenty of things
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.320]   you can do without any equipment, they've got a high intensity interval training, which is they've
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.360]   got the dance, which is kind of like aerobics. They've got yoga and cool down. But they also have it.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.720]   I actually really like this because I have the equipment. They have a stationary bicycle workout,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:30.240]   a treadmill workout, and a rowing workout. I like rowing, but rowing is kind of mind-numbing because
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.000]   so having an instructor say, okay, now you're going uphill or what I don't know what they say,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   but I'll let you know tonight after I do it. So I think I'm excited. I think Apple is going to
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.240]   find a market of fairly large market of people who don't want to spend a lot of money on a gym
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.480]   membership or these days can't go to the gym. And I think this is it's Apple doing a very good
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.000]   thing for fitness. They also we didn't we showed this on iOS today and I didn't know about it,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.920]   but they really expanded the capabilities of the health app. It can now tell you how unfit you are.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:14.080]   Thanks, Health App. There's a cardio fitness thing. You have to enable this once you do,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.600]   for instance, if I look I can look at a year of cardio fitness, this is I've been wearing the watch.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.800]   You can see that the downward trend starting with VO2 Max more men like mine.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   Yeah, well it started look oh how interesting started go down in March when the quarantine began
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.520]   and it's been it's been a steady decline in fitness since the quarantine began.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.960]   Yeah, sometimes you don't want to see the numbers. Yeah, I wonder if that really is part of like
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.080]   they do such a good job with health. I wonder if part of is realizing that at some point
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.960]   the numbers are going down enough that we should stop focusing on numbers and start focusing on
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:59.920]   just simply hey you got out today. Yes, you took a walk. You left the building. Yeah,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.720]   and it ties in if you have other devices. I mean really this is mostly watch information,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.440]   but there's sleep information. I have a sleep tracker. There's so this is becoming
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:18.800]   slowly, subtly, but now not insignificantly a really complete quantified self on the health app,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.200]   including I just got a Bluetooth enabled toothbrush and I've got dental health in here as well.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.440]   I'm like Georgia see those sleep numbers Leo, because she's all over the next. Sleep is not good.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.600]   Sleep is not good. Or maybe do let her see them. It's always on the hand washing. I've averaged
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:42.720]   26 seconds. I've got tooth brushing, blood alcohol content. I don't have anything to blow into so
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:49.920]   that might be insulin delivery number number of times fallen. This is really amazing.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   Yeah, yeah, I just I'm kind of blown away because they've done it so gradually.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.720]   But at this point there is a lot of data. It's been collecting. And I think this is good. Yes.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.680]   Do you agree Renee? Yeah, I think I think it was really apt when a few months ago or it was
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.320]   the last year I've lost all track of time and space when they were talking to Tim Cook and he
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.160]   said that he thinks when they look back over the long arc of history, the greatest contribution
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.120]   Apple have made is to health. And I think we're seeing that systematically come up on the small
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.520]   things like the sensors are putting into the watch to things like the health app, the new fitness
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.640]   fitness plus all of the technology that they've been selling there. They're now making it fully
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.080]   operational, not in a death star sense, but in a very like fully operational Star Wars sense of
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:42.720]   giving you all the information you could want. And then subtly prodding and coaching you into
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:50.400]   doing something about it. Yeah, yeah. I love it when a business plan and it's an aggressive
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.560]   and very, very profitable business plan is not necessarily incompatible with doing good for
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.760]   your customers. And this is exactly the sort of example that I think we should all focus on that
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.080]   Apple gets dinged a lot by, Oh God, why is there stuff so expensive and why is there
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.480]   there's such an ecosystem that you kind of have to buy into. But the thing is when it comes to health,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.120]   it's the fact that they are able to say, look, here are if you if you the watch will work well with
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.080]   your subscription plan, your subscription plan will run really well with your Apple TV.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.600]   All these things will have a health app that's running on your phone will have senses on your
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.960]   phone as Renee said. And that will allow us to give you to make this entire big sticky rice ball of
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:38.320]   Apple stuff into the most comprehensive and powerful health tool that anybody can ever use. So it's
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.200]   sometimes it's okay. There's such a thing as benevolent dictatorship. And I think that Apple's
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.400]   relationship with health products is exactly the example that we need.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.640]   Rosemary, what do you think? Is it all available in England in the UK?
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.880]   Yeah, yeah, it all seems to be available over here. The Apple store this morning did a bit of a
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.440]   refresh to just highlight all those fancy fitness things that they've got. I think there was something
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.600]   to do with the jump rope on there. Or maybe that was because I was looking at something and I'm
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:12.480]   remembering an intended smart jump rope. That would be cool. There are smart jump ropes. And
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.400]   what I'm you know, what I've seen over, you know, the course of 2020, let's be honest,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.520]   is the number of people buying fitness related home stuff is obviously skyrocketing. And I know
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:31.200]   this because I was looking at Nintendo switch games and accessories this morning. Not because I don't
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.120]   want to use fitness plus I absolutely will use it. But I like having a big variety of things to go
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   through. So I've already got ring fit. But there are some other things as well. So I'm going to be
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.520]   trying a whole bunch of them. I have a Zumba game for the Nintendo switch on the way, which I
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:53.440]   be a progress. I bought the ring and I've never used it. It's it's like the ring we use in Pilates.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:01.360]   It's a metal spring ring with it's covered in rubber. What are the exercises on? I feel like
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.560]   it looks like a steering wheel. I thought like maybe some of them would be like driving. I think
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.480]   games like the Zina ring like you throw at people. I don't know. What do you do with it? Respirate
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.200]   color, check room. Basically you do whatever your character on screen is doing. And because
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   you had a story with an adventure that you're trying to sell. You ended up doing some weird
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.320]   things. So there was one I was doing this morning where you have to hold it behind your head and
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   squeeze it together. Which you know and there's a whole bunch of stuff. And there's a you put one
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.840]   of the Joy-Cons on your thigh. But if you're doing that with the Nintendo switch, which is quite fun.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.800]   And I love the fact that there are all of these things out there. And I think fitness plus is
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.680]   a good one because it doesn't require. And you know if you've got a device assuming you have at
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.880]   least an iPhone, which you know if you've got an Apple watch at the moment you pretty much need
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.640]   an iPhone. Yes. Well you know there is the family setup thing where somebody can set one up for
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.160]   say you know an older person or a child. But most people are going to have at least an iPhone or
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   an iPad. And so if you've got one of those you're going to be able to use this. You know assuming
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.640]   physical capability, which I don't know how accessible things are from that perspective.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.320]   But I do know I saw something earlier today that they've actually integrated ASL
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.440]   into all of the fitness plus. We saw that. So Mike and I were watching, we're doing the dance
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.640]   one and he begins with some. He just and it's very quick and subtle and I didn't notice it.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:31.120]   Mike has said he just did ASL. All the instructors have learned ASL so that they can sign as well as
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.400]   speak the instructions. But they toned it down. Like they said that at first they were doing the
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.080]   whole thing in ASL and the community actually told them that was too much. They couldn't pay
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.320]   attention to all of that. So now they just do their catch phrases, their greetings and their
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.640]   little shout outs. It's inclusive. That's beautiful. I think that's really great. And the ages they
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.840]   go from 30 to 60 for the trainers, which I think is you know the older I get them. I saw a guy who
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.640]   looked as old as me. I was shocked. Yeah. I have to say I was thinking about this because I know
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.800]   you remember I gave my mom an Apple watch for the fall and the emergency stuff.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.000]   And I didn't set it up. She has an iPhone so she set it up with her 12 pro.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.560]   And I've been walking through it. But I think that fitness plus she's 87 might be a little
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.800]   too. I didn't see anything really. There were no chair exercises.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   You can. They show you in the introduction one that like with the yoga you can use a chair for
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.560]   the poses. I'll go through that with you. If you could do yoga, that would be good. But none of the
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.920]   other stuff was really doable. I thought what were you thinking? I was thinking the same thing
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.320]   from my mom. You know like how accessible would it be to her? And I saw some of the chair things.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.720]   She does Tai Chi no. I think twice a week. Perfect. But you know like but on demand like having this
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.400]   kind of thing available, you never know like or even just the cooldowns might be interesting.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.840]   If they added Tai Chi, I would be really interested. Yeah. Or Chi Gong or one of the other kind of
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.120]   yeah. See, I want to learn like proper Chen family Tai Chi and I'm sure they would put on some sort
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.440]   of American. It'd be hipster Tai Chi. And then it would be uncanny valley for me. Yeah. But see
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.000]   you're you know, you're you're a special person. Most of us are like the boxing like have like
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   they have boxing in some of the hit stuff, but it's not real boxing. It's a tie. I don't know
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.120]   tie. I don't know what to call it. Tai but or something. But like if they were doing like actual
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.160]   boxing and I'm sure they're going to expand like it's the first day there's lots of possibilities
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   there. Right. Yeah. It's going to be great if they have a really big spectrum because I am the kind
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.720]   of person who I'll I've wrote her to take my hour long walks like every day or every other day.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.320]   But what would really get me going on this sort of thing is if there were a workout that is really
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.440]   not so much of a workout just so much of a hey let's do let's just be silly in the middle of the
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.200]   living room for about a half an hour and see how that works. What's because I clean the house.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.600]   Okay. Well, let's not let's not be that. But that's how that I think what throws a lot of people off
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.400]   of like people like me off of fitness plans like this is that well, I'm not going to buy I'm not
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.320]   going to spend $200 to buy the special outfit and the special bells and I'm not going to and I'm
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.120]   not looking to enhance my VO max for my next biathlon. I just want to be a little bit more active and
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.240]   the perception is that the Peloton for us is I'm not going to spend $5,000 on something that's
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:24.560]   trying to train me to become. But but as a gateway drug so to speak as a way to say well, here's
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.840]   here's something you were kind of already paying for because as part of your bundle.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.640]   Here is just your daily just sort of like jump up and down for a while and wiggle your arms.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.040]   That would sort of get you and then once you start getting into it, that's like once you start
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.160]   looking forward to your 30 minutes of just jump up and down or just like a dance dance revolution
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.440]   sort of a game. Yes. I really, really like where I've just I just
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.040]   said listen to this really good. These savers are great workout actually. Yeah. I don't play it
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.520]   because I can't I don't have a Facebook account. Can I just say how much smarter Andy is than me
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.720]   because I would be the person who would buy all this stuff and not use it and he's at least smart
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.760]   enough not to buy this stuff and then not use it. Was it you Rosemary who mentioned the office
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.200]   dinner party episode where they briefly visit Michael Scott's garage and it's full of every
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:17.600]   gimmicky as seen on TV. Seen on TV, thymaster exercise. I'm not sure who that is. So I don't
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.280]   think that was me. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. He's an office fanatic. He'll blame Mark Micah. Yeah.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.760]   I'm kind of halfway between Andy and Renee here where I buy some of the stuff and then I don't use
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.640]   it anywhere near enough. But at the same time I do have you know I've got just dance installed on
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.040]   my iPhone, my iPad, my Apple TV and my Nintendo Switch. Nice. It's fun. And you know it's one
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.680]   of those things where even if you only do a song then it ends up getting you up and moving and that's
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.560]   I think is a good start. And so by giving you know people three months for free there's a fairly
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.520]   good chance that people are going to go oh yeah I'll sign up for that. And they'll do a video and
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.840]   then maybe their doctors will say to them you know early next year hey you know you've really
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.520]   not been very active over the last nine months. You should probably consider you know increasing
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.080]   your daily activity and then they might have another look at it again. And I think that that
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.560]   will be a good thing because there are a lot of people who over the last nine months have
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.520]   basically ended up sitting in the same chair for 16 hours a day doing not a huge amount of physical
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.480]   activity. And it's not good for us you know as humans we do need to get up a booth. I mean I feel
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   saying because this is me I've been you know I mean I've moved chairs. You know I've rearranged
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.880]   my office. I've moved house. I've moved country. I've done a few things but at the same time the
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   vast majority of my day is spending a good chunk of time sitting in this chair in this room working
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   on this machine in front of me. And yes you know we we all need to be aware of what this does to
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   our bodies which is not great for us. And the fact that even if it is just 20 minutes of yoga or
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.240]   stretching or even if you just do a cool down then that's probably going to be better for you
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:04.640]   than doing nothing at all. Can I like about this so much? Go ahead. I was going to say the thing I
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.200]   like about this so much is that you exactly to Rosemary's point our bodies feed on motion as
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.760]   much as they feed on food and a lot of us are starving on motion right now. And I like the way
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.920]   they structured it so that you can do it at home you can do it eventually if you travel. But they
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.360]   also said that some people just go to the gym and they see something like a rowing machine and they
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.200]   don't really know what to do with it so they never approach it. It's really nice. You just stick your
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.520]   iPhone down or your iPad yeah. Any equipment that and they'll expand the amount of equipment I
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.920]   assume I presume because they have treadmills now and it's the instructors you know and you
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.720]   get that burn bar to say yes I'm you don't know who you're beating because apple privacy but you
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.960]   know you're beating everybody and that's the only thing you really care about. I should mention well
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.400]   structured for that. The Wall Street Journal review said they really liked it except you have to have
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.640]   an Apple watch but I should mention as it turns out you don't have to have an Apple watch.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.960]   If you use it now I'm trying to remember where it was you could use it without an Apple watch I
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.200]   think on the Apple TV. So I'm going to say you needed it at first like when all the pre-launch
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.400]   stuff said you needed an Apple watch and then surprise. Yeah but it works better with the Apple
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.240]   watch you're going to be a lot happier with the Apple watch but you get no metrics without it.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.760]   Yeah I'm glad that they didn't say you have to have an Apple watch. I think if you start the
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   workout on your iPhone or iPad and you're not worrying about the watch it will ask you if you
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.480]   want to start a workout without the watch. Of course you're not going to get those on display on-screen
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.960]   metrics. So it's the opposite of what I said. The Apple TV does require it but the iPad and the
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.040]   iPhone do not. The Apple TV is so clever though because like they didn't use your Apple TV accounts
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.400]   because like let's say Leo you're at your mom's place and she has an Apple TV but she doesn't
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:44.000]   have fitness plus you just tap your watch and it's your profile. It looks for you based on Wi-Fi
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   right if you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network but it finds you on Wi-Fi. So when I fired it up
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.280]   last night when I first got it by the way you have to update your Apple TV too. It saw Lisa's
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:59.600]   Apple watches saw my Apple watches said who's doing it. So that is really great. You could do
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.440]   a finished client hotel. It's a very thin client. It's 44 millimeter client.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:14.720]   I'm thrilled. I just couldn't be more thrilled. Apple also introduced the nutrition warnings
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:21.120]   for privacy. In the App Store there's a big surupdate that does that 11.1 but also on the iOS
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:29.840]   devices. We had a little bit of a conversation on iOS today because Mike has started going through
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:38.080]   the Facebook nutrition label. Just one app calorie not very private. But so when you do it the first
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:45.840]   thing you'll see is Apple's disclaimer that we this is on information that comes from the developer.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   We cannot verify it and of course they can't. What would they do? Send somebody over to the
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.160]   Facebook place. Are you taking good care of that data? They can't do that.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:00.400]   Mark just slams the door. No, yes. What? So keep driving.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:09.680]   I think my position on this and I'm just curious what you all think is there is stuff that the app
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.760]   requests Rosemary, Rosemary, you're a developer so tell me if I'm wrong on this. When you when you
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.760]   create an app for these devices there are intents that you have to express permissions you have to
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.680]   ask to say access contact list or a camera and we've all seen those before. So that part of the
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:34.240]   privacy label is accurate. It's what this is what the app has said it needs permissions for.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.120]   But then there's a lot more that it could gather or that the privacy policy says they gather
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:47.360]   that is all just kind of fluff as far as I'm concerned. The only thing Apple can say for sure is the
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.600]   app is doing this much. Is that right Rosemary? As far as I can tell, yes. You know,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.280]   developers I have to sign to say yes I input this information and I've input it correctly.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.240]   And James Thompson, actually the developer of P.K.O.K. and Dice has been tweeting a little bit
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.040]   about that this morning. So if people are interested they should probably look up his Twitter account
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.920]   because obviously he's explaining you know what's behind you know why P.K.O.K. needs data
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.240]   and how it's used. But it is very much up to the developer to say for themselves.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.280]   This is this is Facebook's. And by the way you have to scroll down a ways to get it's under
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:33.040]   the ratings and reviews app privacy. It says the developer Facebook incorporated indicated
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.000]   that the app's privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.080]   That's basically it's not an affidavit. It's not it's not they're not under
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.280]   Oh, it's it's not lying. Sure. They're also doing their absolute best to avoid any sticky legal
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.400]   problems. Oh, yes. Which you know they've done because they've opened up the barrel of sticky
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   legal problems and they're dancing on the slightly frozen top going fine over here.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.240]   Don't worry about it. In fact, the FTC announced that they're investigating.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.440]   Well, this is kind of inches. They're not investigating. They requested from Facebook and
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.600]   10 other tech companies information about their privacy policies. But again, it's not a legal
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.720]   investigation. It's just information. It's a study. So this is the problem. It's very hard to see
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.000]   into these companies and unless they get caught out, which Facebook has many times and all Facebook
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.920]   does is go, Oh, it was a bug. We're so Google to we're sorry. Well, it won't happen again. And
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.600]   then it happens again. So I don't trust these guys as far as you can throw them,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.840]   which means that the only thing on the nutrition label that's of any use is
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   well, it says the following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:50.160]   companies. Data linked to you the following data may be because there's a lot of a lot of
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   weasel words may be collected and add links to your identity. Privacy practices may vary.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.200]   I feel like this, you know, for all the noise that people made about, Oh, this is terrible.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.800]   We're just going to end advertising as we know it and all that stuff.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:13.360]   It isn't. It's pretty anodyne. It's not. I don't think, you know, this is what Facebook says they do,
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.680]   but you could have read that anywhere. I guess it's good to. My fear is that people, as we've seen
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.120]   before, when they actually look at privacy policies, freak out. And one of the problems with the way
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:33.360]   it works on mobile devices, for instance, if you want to use photos, again, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:41.200]   resume, but the permission is very broad. It's like, and so it will say this company is asking
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.040]   permission to read, write your photos to share them, to upload them, to download them.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.480]   Yeah. It's often worse than that because it says that they are asking for permission to access your
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.520]   camera, which, you know, how do you freak out a grandmother? Ask your true install an app that
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.960]   then says, Hey, I want to access your camera. Wait, what? And there's no facility built into Xcode
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   to say, Oh, no, just for this little thing. All of these are fairly broad. I mean, they are getting
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.040]   there. So specifically on the photos example, with iOS 14, we saw the ability to grant an app
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:20.400]   access to a specific subset of photos, which, you know, works really nicely until you accidentally
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.360]   grant WhatsApp access to one photo and then wonder why you can't share other things from your camera
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:31.040]   role with your friends. Because it and then you have to go digging around in settings and finding
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.280]   that and fixing it. And there doesn't appear to be a way for app developers to link to that
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:44.160]   specific setting part, say, Hey, you know, here's how you go toggle it, which is a bit tricky,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.120]   but yeah, it's one of those things where when you ask for permissions, it feels like, you know,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.600]   it's asking for the world. At the same time, I do feel like a lot of app developers go,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.920]   Oh, yeah, but if we do this, then people aren't going to be happy. And so I end up having to
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   input my name and date of birth and my height and my weight for every single app that I download
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.240]   that's vaguely related to health, when if they just popped up a thing, then they could ask me
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.120]   for permission to access that data and fill it in from health. And that would be much easier. So
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.400]   yeah, I think we will see improvements there with iOS 15, or at least I hope so.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.520]   Yeah, getting more granular is good. And as you say with photos now, you can say allow access to
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.400]   all photos or just select photos. I'd like to see more of that. That's good. Renee.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's always a concern to me because you do have dialogue fatigue and you do have like
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.080]   we're having this huge debate about this is another topic. We're having this huge debate about the
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.400]   the Chrome installer because you don't get the consent to it anymore. And I'm a big, I think
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.000]   consensual computing is incredibly important. And it's got a huge tradition on the Mac.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.680]   And all of these things, Apple's been very good at pushing them out increasingly through iOS and
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.600]   then bringing them back to the Mac so that you have to agree to everything. And I think if you
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.640]   haven't used the Mac for a while and you install Catalina or Big Sur, you will be shocked at how
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.880]   many of those pop ups you get. Like, can I access your documents folder? Can I access a downloads
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.720]   folder? Can I access the desktop folder? Can I access your photos, your contacts? And I do
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.160]   worry that it's getting overwhelming and that we might need to figure out a way to present a
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.240]   unified sheet to people because the last thing you want is them just to click, okay, okay, leave
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.440]   me alone. Stop. Why are all these pop ups? I have work to do. So I think there is a very, very fine
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.960]   balance. I do like these nutrition labels because they're they're not modal. They don't get in your
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.880]   way. They just give you information information.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.360]   Information, informational dialogue. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.960]   Apple's put theirs in the weirdest place imaginable. If you want to see them for a built-in app,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.360]   you've got to go to support, find the list and go to the individual app pages in support
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.040]   to see them. And I wish they would put those in the early come up.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.360]   Though, WhatsApp was complaining that they had to tell people, but Apple didn't.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.040]   Was that a late change that Apple said, Oh, no, no, you do. We do.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.600]   In response to WhatsApp, it was just that WhatsApp didn't know that.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.800]   I think nobody could find them. No one knew it was there. Yeah. I mean, and there is
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.480]   bland as you'd expect. Like, we don't collect anything. Thanks for reading this form.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.840]   But I still think, you know, just for appearance, I say it could be good if they were in that
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.240]   pop-up that you get the first time you open a new like an updated app on iOS. I agree. Yeah.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:23.840]   All right. By the way, here's the jump rope, Rosemary. I found one. Oh, yes. That's the one.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.360]   Factory, 10 gram factory, smart rope, LED jump rope, medium. But as far as like, I don't know if
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:36.880]   it has a health, it lights up. You pair it with the smart gym app. So you have to,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.400]   I would love to see it. It's a health kit. It's a right thing. Oh, yeah. There it is.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.760]   I see it. Yeah. Yeah. So you can even, I don't know what would be this stat. You jumped a thousand
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:52.800]   times today. I don't know. I mean, it's got 23 LEDs. What do they do? Oh, they display your fitness
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.680]   data in midair. It says, huh? Yeah. Could people behind you read what's going on with you?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.960]   I think somebody may need to get one of these for science. I'm guessing Andy is not about to
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:12.720]   volunteer, but Renee might. Well, they have a $49 rookie model or the $80 non- rookie
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.280]   model. I guess I don't know. I got one of the Apple yoga mats. So you know, obviously, I have
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   two situations. Did you? I had to because I want to know what Apple thinks as a yoga, because like
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.960]   the Apple store buyers, they are incredibly fussy and they're not usually price sensitive,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.040]   but they're also not. Also, the value, it doesn't always provide the value that I think they think
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.680]   they do. It does. So I was just really curious as to what a yoga mat from an Apple store. Wait a
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.120]   minute. It's 78 bucks. A 78 dog. There's a more. That's the low best. The cheap one. That's the
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:48.000]   peasant one. That's the cheap one. That's 120. Yeah. What the pro yoga mat give me a freaking
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.400]   break. Yoga match should be $4. Just pieces of rubber.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.840]   Here's a tip for everybody that hasn't figured this out already. You copy the product name from
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.680]   the Apple store. You go and Amazon and buy it at half the price because that's what you do with the
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:09.840]   era. Really? So the era is still available in the Apple store aren't even the era six models,
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.880]   which are available already in the US. They're not over here. They have a pass certification.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.720]   But if you buy them directly from Amazon, they're way cheaper, which makes sense because they're
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.800]   an Amazon company, but they're also sold in the Apple store. And often things are around about
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.480]   the same price in the Atma weather station is usually about the same price in the Apple store
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:34.560]   as it's on Amazon. But some things are just way too bad. It's the same price in Amazon, but they
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:41.120]   offer a less expensive beginners. That's just that's just criminal talk. We'll put it off for a
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:47.920]   less expensive version of a product. What is this less expensive? I'm a pro. I need the $120 pro
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:55.200]   yoga. Muh, lovey. Wow. As far as I'm concerned, a yoga mat is there for one reason to keep your
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.040]   feet from slipping. I don't really understand why this is so expensive. It's probably made from
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:07.600]   reclaimed space shuttle reentry foam that is guaranteed to last your burn ring. We have a short
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.480]   video about how we calculated the chamfer angle on the edge of this mat. We'd like you to watch it.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.040]   Do believe it or not. Also, the purple color is
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:22.640]   it's impossible to make a joke about that. Too fussy. Too stuffy about trial.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:29.600]   Oh, wait a minute. What's she doing? Is she sprinkling rice sprinkled generously with sea salt?
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:35.280]   What is this? What is going on? What's strange? Is she going to sous vide herself? What's going
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:42.160]   on her? She is going to taste good after smoking. Wow. That's what I do exactly what I do
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:51.440]   to my ribs. Let's sit for 24 hours. I sure that's not a big tortilla. Maybe she's going to
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.880]   wait a minute now. Black beans. What is she doing? So you're supposed to you have to you have to
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.080]   salt it before you use it. You have to salt the earth Leo after you bury something. Oh my god.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.760]   I've never done any of this stuff. Now. The problem with this is I have carpet inside.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.240]   Yeah. If I do that, I'm never going to get the souls out. She's got excellent downward dog.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.040]   Very, very well done. That's good. Enjoy the process. It's going to take you a day or two.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.320]   These are all that's what I that's why I've been screwing up. I haven't been
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.400]   I've been using like Morton's table salt. That's why I can't get the downward dog.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   I just yeah, that's it. I'd like to see you do a downward dog Andy. That would be
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.800]   well, I'll give you a link by only fans. You there is. I think that's at the $15 level.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   Only fans, baby. I'd also like to point out Manduka also sell a yoga mat cleaner,
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.920]   which is a organic yoga mat renewed spray cleaner with essential oil for $35.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:54.240]   Oh my goodness. So you can get all of the accessories or you can do what I did a while ago and just
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.400]   buy a very cheap yoga mat and let Renee Richie do the testing of the fancy one.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.160]   Be happy with it. I just use whatever packing material I have available
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.480]   coming in the Amazon box for the actual thing I bought.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.000]   Just I think that's fine. Let's take a little break. We're going to have more in just a bit,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:16.160]   but I have to pay for my yoga mat. This my friends. This is brand new from G technology.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:23.280]   This is armor lock. How many I know a lot of you are working in the trades where you maybe you put
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:30.240]   edited TV shows and movies on hard drives to send them to clients. Maybe you put specs on hard
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.760]   drives. Maybe like me, you carry a hard drive around with you all the time for backup.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   What I'd really like is a hard drive that is encrypted and is secure. So somebody else got it.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   They they couldn't get access to it. That's probably what you like. This is armor lock. It's a very
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:59.520]   fast NVMe SSD drive. This is the latest USB 3.2. It's very fast. Let me plug it in because I'm
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.560]   going to show you the coolest part. When you first plug it in, can you see that? It is locked.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.520]   And there's no way to unlock it. You can't mount it. You can't see it. What you do is you get your
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:15.280]   phone. There's a Mac app as well. So I phone it or Mac and you open the armor lock app. So it can
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:21.600]   see the armor lock. It uses Bluetooth LE to see the hard drive. I tap it. It uses Face ID.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.120]   It uses authentication on the iPhone. Now the armor lock is unlocked. In fact, it popped up
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.280]   with all of my stuff on it. And this is on Windows. It works on any computer. Actually formatted this,
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:39.120]   I think XFET. So I could run it on Windows and Mac. And I've got all my most vital stuff on here.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:46.480]   PGP keys, password vaults, all of that stuff stored on a drive that I can carry around with me.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:53.920]   That's armor lock. If you want somewhere secure, somewhere fast, it's an SSD NVMe.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:39:03.440]   Easy to carry. Two terabytes. It's IP67, dust and water resistant. It's using the same encryption
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:12.080]   technology that a file vault uses. 256-bit AES-XTS. Full disk encryption. And I love it that it uses
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:20.320]   the biometrics on the phone or your Macintosh for the unlocking. This is a great way to share
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.360]   drives because I can add people to my armor lock. I can say I'm going to send this to Joe.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:32.800]   And he can be authenticated to open the armor lock. It's of course, G technology, which anybody
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   who's used a Mac for any length of time, I remember Scott Borne would only buy drives with the big
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:45.440]   G on it. And he had tons of them stacked up in front of his Macintosh. They manufactured not only
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.640]   their own SSDs, they manufacture the controllers as well. So this is high quality. In fact, they
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:57.280]   just won the Consumer Innovation Award at the Flash Memory Summit. If you are transporting
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.560]   data of any kind, whether it's your own data or movies or films or TV shows, if you're worried
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:11.280]   about lost or stolen drives, if you want security, G technology's armor lock NVMe SSD is amazing.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.680]   They say, "We overthought security." So you don't have to. I am so impressed by this. And by the way,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:23.600]   when I'm done, I just press the locked icon on here, locks it up and it unmounts it and I can
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:30.400]   remove it from the computer. It couldn't be easier. Take control of your data privacy with G technology's
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:38.960]   armor lock NVMe SSD. If you go to getarmerlock.com, you'll find it there. Highly recommend it. I'm a
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:46.160]   big fan. Getarmerlock.com and please use that URL so they know you saw it here on Mac Brake Weekly.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:57.200]   Getarmerlock.com. Now I can eject unplug and it's fully encrypted, locked and secure. I keep this.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.960]   Finally, I have something I can carry around and this is too terrible. I can carry on with all my data
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.840]   in my bag without having to worry about somebody getting ahold of it. Thank you,
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:15.280]   Armor Lock, for your support of Mac Brake Weekly. I see Renee Ritchie. I spy with my little eye.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:21.040]   I see Renee Ritchie wearing a very attractive pair of headphones on his head there.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   Giant honking cans? Is that what you're...
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   Giant honking cans. Actually, I loved Gruber's take on this. He said, "Heavy is the head that wears
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.640]   the ear but it's max." A little take up on Shakespeare. How heavy are they? Are they?
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.560]   Do you... They're heavy, but the thing I notice most is that they are so comfortable compared to
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.040]   every other pair of... I stopped wearing over the ear headphones a long time ago because they
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.560]   always just pinched my glasses or they compressed my ears or they just felt weird on my head.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.600]   And these, they have this nice mesh thing here and they have the space foam and the adaptive EQ.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.080]   If it knows there's a gap because of your glasses or detects that I should say it adapts the EQ to
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:08.000]   compensate for the gap and the sound seal. So far, I mean, this is my long-term test with them.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.560]   I'm going to wear them with a whole show, but so far it's way more comfortable than I thought they'd be.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.960]   Comfortable is really important. I wear a KG K249 dollars. You see them all the time in
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.040]   recording studios and stuff. And I wear them on the radio show because they're super comfortable.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.400]   You can wear them all day. They sound pretty good. Do these sound $550 good?
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:34.320]   So it's such a tough question to answer because like people will say I can get the Bose or the
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.600]   Sony's for, you know, $250, $300, $350 depending what the sale price is at any given moment.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.880]   And those are all terrific noise canceling over the ear wireless headphones. And then when you
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   start getting into the more expensive headphones like the Sennheiser and the Bang Olafsen,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.640]   those become like reference monitors where you're using them for very specific
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.960]   audio file or literal audio studio needs. And these, you can't use these for studio because
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.000]   they are computational devices. They are fixing everything that you would want to hear and fix
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.560]   yourself. You would just think, oh great, the track sounds fine. Ship it, not realizing that an
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.680]   entire computer computational engine has spent nanoseconds making it sound fine for you.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.040]   Good point. Never even thought of it.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:21.280]   These to me have one very specific market. And that is people who are all in on the Apple ecosystem
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.200]   and are not price sensitive and want the absolute best sound they can get out of streaming services
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:34.000]   like Apple Music. It's very close to me to computational photography where you have this little
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.680]   terrible by most standards lens in a phone, whether it's a Google phone or an Apple phone.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.320]   And because they're so good at the computer part, they can make that the best that it can
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.760]   possibly be way more than that lens has any right being. It is not the same as your Canon or Sony
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:56.240]   Glass at all, but wow, is it great for a phone. And this to me is the same thing. It's like it's
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.800]   not a high end reference set. It's not using uncompressed audio. It's not doing any of those
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:07.200]   things, but I can scarcely believe that I'm listening to Apple Music or I'm watching TV+
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.840]   or Netflix or Disney+. When I'm watching it because it sounds like a full
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.480]   lush, rich soundscape that I'm just not used to hearing from tiny bit rate compressed
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.200]   audio on the over devices. It's a very strange experience.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:29.280]   So it's using Apple's own Bluetooth codec. It's not a proprietary Bluetooth codec.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.360]   Yeah, it is. I don't know how long they'll stick with Bluetooth. I think Bluetooth is an
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.760]   implementation detail for them and it allows compatibility. Airplay too would be a lot better.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.560]   Yeah, except then you start dealing with peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and there's power issues when you get to
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.600]   devices like that are small, like the AirPods Pro, just the power draw of Wi-Fi. But when you start
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.160]   getting more U1 chips out there and they can do a hybrid, right now for bigger devices, they do
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.200]   Bluetooth for discovery and handshaking and then they hand off to peer-to-peer Wi-Fi to
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.600]   race to sleep. But you can't race to sleep with a stream. It's going to keep that radio on. So
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.520]   there's a whole bunch of technical hurdles and maybe the U1 UltraBanships will fix that.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.920]   Say that. What's race to sleep? What is say that again? What is race?
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.480]   Race to sleep. So there's this. People often think that the slower the connection, the more power
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.320]   efficient it has to be. But they discovered a long time ago that if you can get something
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.040]   transferred really fast, you can shut the chips that down right away and that saves way more power
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   than just trying to transfer the things slowly. So instead of streaming a song, you really,
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.360]   you send the whole song over. Yeah. And then you could turn off the chip for three minutes
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:36.080]   while you're listening and then send the next song. Yeah. Okay. But even that with Wi-Fi, it's
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:40.880]   still too power hungry. But I think in the future, we'll see. I don't like Neelie Patel would just
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   scream so loud. We'd hear him from here if Apple did their own version of proprietary
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.480]   Bluetooth and with good reason. And I know there's a bunch of nerds who would love it because they'd
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.280]   get there completely non-compressed audio in a way that Bluetooth doesn't deliver. I hope there's
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:59.040]   a hybrid where Apple uses these three standard-based technologies to let you be compatible with any
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.080]   one of them. But if they detect you're all in on Apple, they just cut into the hybrid stream.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.840]   But they're not using Appdex. They're not using the high quality Bluetooth.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.440]   Not as far as I know. No. But it sounds, and did you buy the cable?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:19.840]   Do they say? I mean, these is a loner, right? Did they send you a cable? No, I didn't get
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.320]   them. I had to buy these. You bought them. Rosemary has the cable, but she doesn't have her headphones yet.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.600]   Yeah, not the camera. So Rosemary, you want to send him? No, it's an oh Henry story.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.040]   No, he's got both. So, how do you try it wired? Does it sound different?
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.920]   No, it sounds the same. I don't think they're doing anything different. I think they're still
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:44.400]   pulling in. So they're not actually playing you the music, which is a weird part. They're
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:50.480]   pulling in the music, completely deconstructing it the way you would have captured off a sensor.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.720]   And then they're building their 3D soundscape based on the data they get from the stream. So
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:00.160]   identifying instruments, looking at things like stereo and 5.0 and atmos.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.080]   Just try to figure out where things should be. And then they build what they call a spatial
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.320]   audio model out of it. So the way they get the data is kind of irrelevant. It's not like they're
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.920]   sending a low bit rate quality version of the song. They're sending the same version of the song.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:20.080]   Yeah. You're saying? Yeah. Yes. But that's an analog cable, isn't it? Or is it a data cable?
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:26.160]   No, it's just convert the 3.5 millimeter analog signal into a digital lightning signal.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.520]   So it is digital. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's interesting. The other end.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:37.440]   Yeah. So it is getting analog into the headphones. It doesn't get a digital bit stream into the
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.800]   headphones. So I don't know. I know in the original 3.5 millimeter adapter that had the
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.720]   DAC built into it. And it was supposedly a fairly good one. I don't know if these have it built
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.480]   in or not. They are $35. So just my wallet is going to help that they're doing something
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:54.000]   morning. I think the DAC is in the cable. But the problem with that is a $35 DAC from audio
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.160]   file point of view is not a very good tech. No. But again, to them, it's irrelevant. You can't
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.960]   charge 200 bucks for a cable. They would really. Yeah. All right. So no, I think this is not an
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   audio file purchase. This is a purchase for somebody who is a fan of Apple technologies like
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:15.520]   spatial audio and wants that in an over the ear headphone. Yes. Rosemary, you're buying it.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:22.480]   Why are you buying it? Yeah. So I'm curious. So I currently have the Sony WHM 1000.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:28.320]   Is that what you're wearing right now? Yeah. Yeah. And they're good. But I'm getting a headache.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.080]   Just where this actually sits right here. It's uncomfortable. I've tried the Bose QC 35s
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:41.120]   and I get ache from the pressure points around my ears. And so basically I am on an ever more
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.280]   expensive quest for more comfortable headphones. Don't get more expensive. Get less expensive.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:55.760]   Get these are $49. The AKG pro audio K to 40s. I can tell you from from 20 years, maybe 30 years
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.480]   of experience. These used to be 250 bucks. Right, John? Suddenly the price just cratered.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:08.000]   Didn't somebody buy them? Yeah. AKG is no longer a KG. I can't remember who owns AKG. But
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.360]   they sound as good as far as I'm concerned. And they do have Bluetooth.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.080]   Yeah. What I do want though is that that instant handoff between devices. So I'm watching video
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.040]   on my Mac and I pause it and I pick up my phone and watch an Instagram video. And that's not
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:31.840]   something that I'm going to get. That's something I kind of had it with the Bose because it compared
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:36.880]   to two devices at once. And then it'll switch between them and you can use the app to say,
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.560]   oh, and disconnect from my Mac and connect to my iPad, which is a bit of a faff. But if you're
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.880]   pretty much just living on your iPhone and your iPad, it's all right. And especially if say you're
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.920]   on a plane and you just want to be able to watch things and listen to music and watch a video on
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:58.960]   your iPad and go back to listening to music, that works. But living in pandemic land, I'm at home,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.720]   I'm on my Mac as much as I'm on any other device. So I'm looking for that automatic handoff. And
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:10.000]   I'll see I'm willing to return the headphones if they don't work for me. But I'm very much
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.480]   hoping they will. Yeah. It was Samsung who bought AKG, I just double checked.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.120]   Samsung, they own everything. Samsung. Maybe that's why they're so cheap now.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.640]   They don't care. They can't tell the difference because I had the more expensive ones and
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:30.720]   one day they got replaced by the $49 ones. Do you use audio file headphones, Leo? Do you ever
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.440]   use those like the $1,000 reference monitors and studio mixing sets? Say again, do you ever use
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.080]   the studio like the audio file or just like the studio mixing high-end monitor $1,000?
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:48.400]   Yeah, I have high-five man $1,000 headphones with planar magnetic drivers.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:55.120]   Those are audio file headphones. They sound marvelous. The spatial openness of the sound,
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:01.200]   it's really hard to describe. It's like wine. There are a few words, but it may not be meaningful to you.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:10.160]   But to me, what audio file headphones do is there is an openness. The instruments are much more distinct
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:16.320]   and there's a clarity that you hear with high fidelity headphones that you don't hear with
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.320]   anything less and even a $500 headphone, you're not going to hear that. You really need to get
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.840]   some very, very fancy headphones. But my rationale for that is for a thousand bucks,
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:32.080]   I'm getting what would cost much more in speakers exactly on my head. I like them. I don't wear
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.240]   them all that often, but if you have a very good DAC and it sounds wonderful.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:44.880]   Yeah, headphones aren't necessarily cheap. I'm not a cheap skate. But I would say, if you want
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.720]   comfort, by the way, those high-five men are very comfortable. You could wear them all day easily.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.040]   But that's a lot of them. It's just you don't need a cable and you don't need the DAC or the,
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.320]   what is it, the amplifier? Yeah, these two headphones I'm talking about are pure analog.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.840]   They don't have accelerometers. They don't know which ear you're on, which ear.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:09.600]   You're dead. They didn't have accelerometers. They actually have print an L and an R on the
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.880]   actual headphone instead of weaving it into the cup. You know, it's woven into the cup. Oh, look,
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:20.480]   he's taking the magnetic cup off. Look at that. That's beautiful. That actually is an ice elegant
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:26.400]   touch. Of course, Apple's designed beautiful things. But to me, maybe because I wear headphones
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:35.440]   every day of my working life for the last 45 years, headphones are not a technology object.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.800]   They're a tool. They're a tool. Yeah. That's what was concerning or that's what was on my mind
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.760]   about these things about how I think a lot of the reviewers are going to review them as super high
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:53.360]   quality $550 headphones. Not, but I wonder for the typical consumer is just someone who wants
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:58.800]   better headphones than their ones. They stick in their ears that come from Apple and they're
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:04.480]   willing to their total satisfaction quotient index will be a factor of not only the audio
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:10.240]   quality, but how they feel the features that they've got, how they look, and how how happily they are.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.400]   And so that's the sort of thing I'm really looking forward to reading and reviews and responses.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.240]   Yeah, they're happily. That's for the case. I still have no idea.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:24.320]   Yeah, that's that's that's it looks like it's chaps for your headphones. It's just not good.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.400]   I just wondered this. This is something that Apple is always I don't think they get they get
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.080]   this thing right where they they should realize that for $550, it's not enough that you've got
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.400]   you can talk talk about the kind of steel that you're putting into the headband. Give me a nice
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.480]   case. I know that's a third party opportunity, but you should I would expect to get a good case
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.760]   with it. I would also expect to get the cables I need with it.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.200]   Right. But do you think it is a joke? You think like Johnny was on his way out and he just doodled
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.680]   this down as a as a laugh like take the piss and then let's see it. Oh, you can't take your
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:01.280]   headphones off. Never mind. It's like a bra. Although, Ashley, as
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.640]   Sketha said, it really looked more like a permanent plumber's crack. It looks like chaps. It looks
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.280]   like chaps for your heads for your heads for your heads because they're to keep because you're
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.320]   getting scratched. Yeah. Yeah. Which is nutty. They're not. But they're smart because they've
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.600]   got magnets in. There you go. Yes. If it had a trackpad on it, then it would be magic.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:29.360]   Oh, you've decoded the apple terminology. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I gotta say that I'd be
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.840]   I'd be pretty minus if after spending $550 on these the first time I take it on a trip, I'm wind
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.880]   up fracturing one of the joins in that between the air cups. Is that a hard case? Yeah.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.360]   Yeah. And I mean, I know and again, third party opportunity, I'm sure lots of people are going to
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.000]   come up with nice hard cases. But do I should I really be expected to spend an extra 50, 60,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:55.840]   70, $80 or can Apple is it be be moving on Apple to give me something practical and functional that
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:02.800]   I will want to replace after a year from now? So I'm not going to buy any. I'm impressed that both
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:09.280]   Rosemary and Renee spent their own money buying these. You guys are more dedicated than I am.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.360]   It's okay. I'm sure Alex will show up with a pair that you can try at some point.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:18.000]   I do. I'm really curious about the sound quality. I mean, that's all to me. That's all it matters.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.480]   Comfort and sound. Did Micah order? I didn't see it. Did Micah say what? No, no, no, because I
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.440]   said he couldn't have one. They're the right color for him at least. He loved the green.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   Yeah, he did love the green. Yeah, in his video. Yeah. It's an interesting thing for Apple to do.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:41.040]   I guess it makes sense in the overall Apple ecosystem. My guess is that this is going to be
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.480]   like HomePods where they just they wanted to get the technology out and this is what it cost
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.640]   them to get the technology out now and then we'll have the whatever the version of the HomePod mini
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.840]   is for these next year. The sport version that's 250 bucks or something and then we'll just
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:58.800]   still keep pushing down to them. Speaking of Sir Johnny, I think this is this is a bogus rumor,
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:06.960]   but there is a rumor that Sir Johnny I've or Apple CFO, Luca Maestry is both of them are being
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.600]   considered for CEO Ferrari. I could see Johnny. What's he doing? He's not doing anything.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.640]   But not Eddie Q who's actually on the board of Ferrari. Oh, that's right.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:22.160]   Maybe Eddie's putting those names up. I can do like a press release, right? Like the company says
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.920]   this just to get attention. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:32.720]   It's especially with Johnny. I don't like where has he had that kind of experience and also where
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:37.440]   has he had that show in that kind of interest. Titan. I mean, he's a design guy. You okay.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:45.200]   You bet how? Honestly. Although if an Apple guy, if an Apple person were the CEO, maybe the
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.920]   electrical systems would finally be reliable and I set cars on fire after two years. I wonder how
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:56.880]   hard it is to be CEO Ferrari, really. Is that a tough job? I think it's more ceremonial.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:03.040]   I mean, does he have to drive all the cars and yeah, at the same time, I can see Johnny.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.680]   Have people for that. He has people. Yes, people. I can see. Eddie used to have the
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.480]   low Ferrari at Infinite Loop, which was always always got attention. Yeah, Eddie. I forgot
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.120]   Eddie's on the board at Ferrari. I've completely forgot that. Apple's play.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:24.080]   Yeah. I'm waiting, by the way, for my new Mustang, which will have car play and Android Auto,
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:29.440]   but wireless and it has. It's funny because this is the problem. There is a mismatch between the
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.120]   time it takes to design a car, deliver it. They've been working on this for three years.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:38.960]   And the time it takes to design and deliver a new iPhone because it has Qi charging in it,
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.480]   but it really should have MagSafe, but it doesn't because it was designed three years ago.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.960]   But it'll be ready for the portless one because it's wireless. Yeah. So you put the phone,
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:52.560]   there's a pad for two phones right there underneath the radio. You put it there and it charges
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:59.440]   while it's sitting there and it's wirelessly car playing. I can't wait. That's going to be kind
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:06.320]   of cool. My wireless Kia play solution involved buying a magnetic mount that slides into the CD
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.520]   slots of my 10 year old car and the MagSafe charger. Perfect. Magnetized this two step
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:16.800]   magnetic dock and then my phone goes on the MagSafe. It actually works super well. I bet.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:22.880]   And a cable that is not dissimilar to this wonderful cable that Apple
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:29.760]   allowed me to purchase from my AirPods Max in that it's USB on one end and aux on the other.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:34.480]   And that creates a Bluetooth environment so that my phone can absolutely talk to my car
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:40.400]   wirelessly. Works surprisingly well and bonus my car is 10 years old. I had a cassette with a
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:45.520]   little wire hanging out of it in my car for the longest time. That was how I connected everything
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.200]   and it actually does work very well. You know it doesn't work well though as the ones that
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:55.200]   use a little tiny FM radio transmitter. Bad idea. Tried all of those. Yeah.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:58.800]   Yeah. I'm super impressed with the Bluetooth. I thought it was going to be really janky and
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.680]   cut out all the time. The only problem is is when you turn on the electric so the car
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.760]   then the Bluetooth turns on and then when you turn the car on then the the electric's briefly
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:13.440]   turn off and then turn back on again. So that means that my shortcut that I would like to pop up so
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:20.080]   that I can run it as my sat nav pops up twice. But you know it's okay. Are you gonna have you
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.520]   played with app clips Rosemary and making an app clip out of an app at all. I have not played
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:30.000]   with making it. I've been following with great interest what other people are doing for my personal
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.200]   apps. I'm not seeing any great use case these are things that people would download at home and
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.800]   do stuff with. But for companies who you know are out and about and integrate into restaurants and
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:47.200]   offer their their ordering service especially now with the whole pandemic and people not going
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:53.360]   to tables. I went out to eat earlier this year and we ordered at the table. There was a little QR
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.840]   code on the table. We scanned it. It popped up the menu. We went through and we selected everything
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.320]   we wanted. We had to tell it what table number we were at. Slightly ridiculous. They could have
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.480]   embedded we had to tell them which restaurant and which table number that could have all been
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.440]   embedded in there. They could have skipped that for us. But you know that worked pretty well.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:17.120]   And that was just you know a web app. But I can see that working really well as an app clip and
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.680]   giving people a better experience because then I would definitely been able to pay with Apple Pay
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.840]   which their web app for some reason did not support. Evil John in our chat makes a really
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:34.400]   interesting point. He says app clips are the beach head for Apple glasses. We've seen this.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.680]   Apple do this before. They did it with the M1 where they were they slowly implemented all these
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.200]   changes that by themselves seem like little things. But then suddenly oh it all makes sense
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.080]   in the M1. I think we're doing the same thing with glasses. You could say app clips because of
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.240]   glasses. If they had cameras and I guess they'll have to could could recognize those and automatically
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.800]   do something. Somebody also said spatial audio doesn't make that much sense in a pair of headphones
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.320]   but it makes a lot of sense in a pair of glasses with headphones built into them. I think we're
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.880]   and lidar same thing right. What's who cares about lidar on your iPad or iPhone. I mean it's kind of
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.280]   a gimmicky thing. But and I guess you could use it for camera focus. That's nice. But
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.760]   it makes a lot of sense in a glasses in an augmented reality world. So maybe that's what
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:29.520]   this is all about. There's also another thing Rosemary that I didn't think of but Micah pointed out on
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.080]   iOS today. It doesn't just have to be for you know out and about parking or restaurant.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.960]   Some developers are going to start using them to in effect put a small demo of their app on your
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:47.360]   phone. Yeah. Yeah. So that's interesting. So that would be like there is no way to do demos in the
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.640]   app store right now. But if you could have a demo with app clips that was sufficiently functional
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.040]   that people could say, Oh, I like this. And it disappears after a day. Right. It doesn't stick
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:02.080]   around on your phone. But if they said, Oh, I like this. This might be an interesting use case for
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:08.320]   this suddenly became available yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that working quite nicely.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   Obviously it depends very much on on what it is the app actually does because you know you've
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.040]   already got a very minimal app. I'm just going to use dice by James Thompson here as an example.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.160]   There is no point to having an app. But you know James will do that. He's going to
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.360]   hold it. Oh, I know he's. If there's an Apple technology, he's on it. Yeah. I mean,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.520]   he's going to do it. But there wouldn't necessarily be a use case. It wouldn't make sense. What am I
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.800]   only going to be able to roll D six or something? Right. Then I want to roll a D 20. We'll download
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:46.640]   the full app. Yeah. Emergency savings throw clip. So Apple added this capability with 14.3.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:54.880]   There is an app clip code generator command line tool and an app clip tool that allow you to
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.080]   you could choose your foreground and background color. There's three different colors in the app
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.560]   clip. A third color that the command line tool generates for you based on the other two colors.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.800]   I do like how they look. I think that you know they don't look like boring old square
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.280]   QR codes. They're round. Yeah. Well, that's to make sure that it's branded with the with Apple.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.480]   I mean, it's it's a really, really powerful idea because this is the sort of thing that
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:29.040]   extends Apple's presence way beyond any sort of software platform where you enter the Metropolitan
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.440]   Museum of Art and you see an app clip tag saying, Oh, by the way, if you want to get a walking
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.640]   tour, if you want to get a map here is just just aim your iPhone at this at this thing. And
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.400]   congratulations. You suddenly have a location aware map that you're using to navigate to this space.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.960]   Same thing for shopping. Same thing for parking passes. Same thing for all these sort of things.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.480]   It does. Yes, it could have really nice applications for for future wearables. But
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:00.000]   just a simple fact of here is something that could be printed by a printer, by a sign maker,
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.080]   by anything, place in place somewhere and have the ability to place a useful piece of software
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.360]   on an iPhone that is not available to everyone who's running a Samsung phone. That's a pretty
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:19.440]   big win for Apple. They so if you've got 14, three, and you see an app clip QR code, try it.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:27.440]   And see what it's like. Tell us how it works out. Tell us how it works out because I'm not going
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.240]   anywhere. And I don't believe I have any QR codes around the house at this point. This has been
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.760]   around forever. Remember there were NFC tags? We had in the old studio, we had little on the
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.800]   on the pillars, little NFC tags, you could tap things like that. Well, those are great too. And
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.560]   the app clip does work with NFC. So imagine the ability to like on a smart speaker, the ability
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.960]   to here's the software that you need or here's the configuration. You just tap it on this device.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   It would be lovely if we were just talking about how great Apple hardware and software works together
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.720]   as part of an ecosystem. But it would be great if JPL who wanted to make their their speakers as
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.920]   attractive to every as to as many people as they want to add this sort of functionality where no,
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.400]   it's not going to be as discoverable as a pair of AirPods. But if you just tap your iPhone against
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   this against the top of this thing, it will all the configuration and all the software that you
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.760]   need will automatically be put onto your phone without any training further setup. So like it is
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:30.960]   just a really, really nice nice way to extend the iPhone into the real world beyond things that
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:36.240]   just have an Apple logo on them. Although my point was going to be these things have been forever
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.760]   and nobody used them. So yeah, but the different this is something that I'm always fascinated by
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.240]   that only only Apple has the ability to really through kind persuasion and the steel boot hill on
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.800]   the on the neck of the developer say that we are strongly suggesting that you support this
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.920]   technology in the future, not only by making you making your app look stupid if it doesn't support
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.960]   it, but also by promising that no, this is not just something that we had some intern throw up and
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.520]   we decided to we had some space left in the last keynote. So we decided to actually roll it out
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.080]   as part of the next hardware update when they actually commit to something they commit to something
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.120]   even they haven't say they have that they they're still selling the home pod. Like even though like
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.600]   it was like, yeah, okay, it's nice, but we don't want it. We want these other stuff, but they didn't
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.080]   just they didn't give it just like one, one year and then discontinue it. This is the commitment
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.840]   that they have. This is why investing in an Apple technology as a developer usually is at least a
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.040]   neutral sort of thing you're not going to get burned by it in the future.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:44.400]   Let's see what else want to make sure we get all the most there's so much happened this week.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:54.880]   Pro raw. Oh, I knew it. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. A lead update. Yeah. So pro raw is now also in
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:07:01.440]   the camera. This is something Hey, like to did their version of but now it's official. This is a
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:10.400]   DNG, which is Adobe's standard for raw, a DNG file coupled with computational data for deep
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:17.040]   fusion and HDR and various other things that the iPhone generates. So in effect, if you shoot in
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:21.920]   pro raw and I'll show you in a second how you can get it. If you shoot in pro raw, you will be
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:28.080]   shooting a raw image, but you'll get a much larger file that has the raw image plus computational data.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:36.320]   A raw image on a 12 megapixel camera like this would be roughly 12 megabytes. This is 25 megabytes.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:42.480]   So that's maybe the only negative on turning this on. You don't turn it on negative is a negative.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.080]   It's big. Yeah, there's a little negative. That's what DNG stands for. Yeah, this you turn it on
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.680]   not in the camera app, but in the settings for the camera app. And it's in the
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:08:01.040]   formats up at the top there. You'll see high efficiency, most compatible. And then there's a
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.280]   new switch for Apple Pro Raw, a 12-bit file that uses the linear DNG format to retain more
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:13.440]   information and dynamic range in the file. And then you had 12 bits Leo. 12 bits. I don't know,
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.240]   is that good? Is it more than 8 bits? It's more than 10 bits and they have a pretty good
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.120]   of dynamic range as well, which is nice. Nice. And then now that you've turned it on on your
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.920]   camera, there'll be a right next to the live photo button. There'll be a raw button and you
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:33.040]   can turn that on. I notice it doesn't stay on. So that's a little annoying. You have to turn
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.120]   that on each time you use it. But that makes sense. They don't want people to fill up their
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.920]   storage. Although that's the reason I got 200. No, I guess I get a 512. I got the biggest
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:45.600]   iPhone I could get because of that and because of vision. And they'll be vision.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:52.640]   I figured I'm going to be filling this memory up pretty quick. So nice. That's now available.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   Hey, Lyda, too, I guess will be updated to use that specifically instead of their own.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.040]   They have a terrific write up. Ben's an off-skim, sure, with a lot of help from Rebecca and said
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:09.440]   amazing in depth. Austin Mann also posted his experience with it. And it's just,
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:15.040]   it isn't like some people are thinking, oh, it's like I take a raw frame off my hassle
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.280]   blade. It's like it's still an iPhone camera, but it lets you get to that data and lets you step
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.800]   through the computational process to tweak things the way you like them. So instead of the very,
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.200]   very good, but very opinionated camera team at Apple's version of what that photo should look like,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.520]   you have all the benefits of all the computational stuff, but you get to put your opinion on it,
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.160]   which a lot of creative people would really like to do. Right. Just having access to that
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.360]   depth information is a huge, huge win. The amount of time that a lot of people,
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.400]   those of us who like to tweak photos, not necessarily spend an hour photoshopping something,
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.880]   but just I just wish that there was more focus on the subject in the foreground. And I wish that
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.320]   the background was more blue. The ability to do that without having to create a mask on your phone,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.400]   but just simply say, you know what the background is, make the background more blue. Don't bother
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:09.360]   with me, but that's what I pay you for. That's just that is going to be just huge, huge, huge.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.200]   Yeah, I realized that funny, you'd think out of thought of this sooner, but I realized that with
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:24.880]   this camera, I took this picture with a Leica and it's fire lit. I didn't want it to be blown out.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.640]   I didn't want it to be bright. I wanted just the reflection of the fire in people's faces.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.040]   That kind of thing. It's out of the fire pit in our backyard. And when I took the same picture with
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:40.000]   the iPhone, it thought I wanted to see all the details. So it exposed everything using all of
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.760]   its trickery. And I got a picture that is not very good. And what I realized is the great thing
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.800]   about the iPhone is it generally is just going to get a great picture because it's going to do
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.400]   all the computational stuff and it's going to be generally what you want. But the reason people
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.000]   like you, Andy, and the reason I carry fancier cameras around is we want more control. We want
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.160]   to be able to change the exposure dial. We want a creative control. And you and until now, you
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.840]   really didn't get that with a smartphone. You got their idea of a best picture.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.440]   You got the memory. It was meant to just help you capture a memory, not make an artistic statement.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.080]   Yeah. So I think this is going to be, I think I would still pull out the Leica to take this picture.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.600]   But I think it's going to be good. It's going to be better.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.960]   You're absolutely right. I think this is why I think that a lot of the,
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.840]   it used to be like five years ago, it was kind of important for me to go to the Boston Public
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.600]   Library with five different phones and take the same shot over and over again with each of the
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.520]   phones and we can both pixel peep, which one does a different, which one is different.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:45.600]   Today, I just don't think that's very useful because I think that almost every phone,
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.960]   every phone camera is as good as every other phone camera. Let's say they're arbitrarily say
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:56.720]   that $400 or more. There are differences when you just take the picture and post it without
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.920]   doing anything with it. But take the picture and then spend, I'm saying 10 seconds, pushing a few
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.560]   sliders around in the stock photos app to make it look exactly like you want it to look.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.480]   Then you get to, well, there's no difference between one or the other. Usually when you get to,
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.880]   when people do these side by side by side comparisons, people are reacting to, oh,
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.160]   I think that the sky is a little bit more blue in this one or I think that there's more detail
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.720]   in the leaves in this one. But it's not consistent from camera to camera to camera.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.800]   All you have to do is just, whether even inside Instagram, decide that I wish that we're a little
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.360]   bit warmer. Boom, two seconds later, it's a little bit warmer. So this is why these sort of developments
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.800]   are a lot more exciting, especially if camera companies, if phone companies decide that we want
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.880]   to make these editing these little quick five second edits more front and center as more of an
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.160]   implication as part of the photo taking process. Although the end result will always be,
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.600]   I'm just here to take, as Renee said, memories. I want to take a snapshot. I want to do, I want
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.120]   as much power behind that one tap of one button as possible. But it's the idea of having pro,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.440]   having a more in depth raw and being able to not even know that you're taking this heavy raw image
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.000]   and that's got depth data and it's got light our data. But simply the fact that for some reason,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.720]   I can now make the, I can now make the faces pop a little bit more without affecting the
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.040]   background. That's what people want. And that's the sort of stuff that Apple iPhones are always great at.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.160]   Renee, you had a good interview with Austin Mann, by the way.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:27.120]   Oh, thank you so much. And here's an example picture from Austin. This is a
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.760]   night shot on the, these are the same device, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but on the left, the HEIC version,
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.800]   both of these imported into Lightroom, on the right, the Pro Raw. And you can see how much more
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:46.400]   detail, how much more clarity, because the HEIC really smooshes the stars, you know, they just,
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:53.600]   and so it really, having all the data from the sensor plus the computational stuff is going to
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.760]   be very interesting. Well, it's like all those photos taken during the fire when it automatically
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.200]   corrected the yellow skies to blue and everyone on Twitter was complaining they couldn't get a yellow.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.520]   I was watching Mark Hez's, he does this smartphone shoot out every year where he takes
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.520]   every smartphone, takes a bunch of pictures and posts them on Instagram and Twitter and people
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.520]   vote on them. And every year, like the iPhone and Pixel get knocked out the first round,
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.680]   like without fail, they get completely annihilated, like all the expensive cameras go down. I think
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.400]   the first year the POCO phone won. This is why I put no stock or credence at all in that shoot out.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.320]   But he's found a pattern, which is interesting. He said like, almost always the brighter photo
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.560]   will win. It doesn't matter about anything else, but if it's brighter, and because Twitter will
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.760]   really boost the sat and Instagram a little bit, the photo that's less blue and more yellow will win.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   Yeah. If you take those two things, the brightest yellow photo will just win the contest because
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.680]   we're all looking at the microphone. Yeah, actually it was a nine to five max. Somebody
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:54.160]   did a head to head with the top of the line Samsung iPhone and Pixel. And I was surprised at actually
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.760]   some of the decisions the iPhone made were terrible in terms of color and so forth. I thought the
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:07.520]   Pixel 5 easily, easily beat the iPhone. But I think it depends on what you're taking a picture of.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.200]   Exactly. And the thing that like the thing it feels like the Pixel will sort of like what Apple
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.360]   started doing in some ways, it will take everything down to the barris to atoms and then give you the
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.840]   best Google picture. Like it's a little bit, it's crispy, it's contrasty, and it's cool. And no
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.640]   matter what you do, it'll always be that where the iPhone sometimes is genius and sometimes there's
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:30.000]   a point to you and it's just really quirky. Yeah. I think it comes down to, you know,
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.240]   what kinds of pictures you're taking. The point really is that the top of the line phones these
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.600]   days all take very good pictures. I just think if you want creative control, that's why people
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:47.120]   still use real cameras. And it's because for a long time I've wondered, why doesn't Nikon,
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:53.760]   Sony, and Canon, why don't they put more computational capabilities into these five and six thousand
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.560]   dollar cameras? And I guess that's the reason is that that's not what a pro wants. They don't want
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.040]   the competition. But also the sensor size is too big. I was talking to some of the people, I talked
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.640]   to the Google team and the Apple team about this and the sensor, those sensors are just too big
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.520]   to do the kind of marketing. And yeah, it's too much to, I mean, they'll get there. But right now,
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.800]   it's to do the kind of stacking that they're doing instantly. That's why I think Google and Apple
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.720]   are still a 12 megapixel cameras and they haven't gotten as big as the other people.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.400]   Yeah, if Canon had an M1 chip in there, maybe possibly. Yeah.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.800]   Even then like that's when you get to those set those sensor sizes are so big compared to what
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:33.920]   Apple and Google are using. Oh, yeah, my Sony, my new Sony is I think 61 megapixels.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:41.120]   Yeah, it's nuts. I mean, that's just nuts. And also, you ask the average user what constitutes
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.560]   a good camera? Yes, they want a good picture. But the one of the things that Apple got on board with
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:52.080]   really, really quickly is that you press the button and even it's not even instant when that
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.600]   picture gets taken. And there's no pause after the picture gets taken before you can take the next
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:02.800]   one. That's what they want. They want to make sure that whatever I'm aiming this damn thing at,
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.360]   it will get a picture of that thing if I just press this picture without accidentally switching
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.920]   camera modes by accidentally swiping the bottom of the screen. And that's not something that other
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.800]   cameras, particularly Android cameras, were any good at. Now there's even now there's some,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:23.520]   a lot of cameras have caught up with it. But Apple is still the king at you will believe, believe
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.680]   you me, if you will, if you suddenly suddenly catch your little kid doing something adorable
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.320]   and you got rattlesnake reflexes, your camera will not let you down, you will get a picture of that
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:40.800]   adorability. At the Halloween, I took a picture of Georgia with both the Pixel 4 and the iPhone.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.880]   I think it was the iPhone 11 in night mode. And I hit them both the exact same time. And then her
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.200]   brother came and put his arm around her. And because they really prioritize zero shutter leg
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:54.240]   on the iPhone, it's a picture of Georgia. The Pixel picture is a picture of Georgia and her brother.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:02.000]   This is, by the way, this is a gave attributed to the wrong site. This is a Mac rumors article,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.960]   camera comparison, iPhone 12 Pro Max versus Google Pixel 5 versus Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.960]   And I mean, even just like if you look at this, the Pixel clearly got the sky right. And the iPhone
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.600]   for some reason just decided that's blue. I don't care. That's blue. It really overwears us here.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:28.800]   Yeah. I've never liked what Samsung does, but look at how blue the cast is on the 12 Pro Max. So,
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.480]   yeah. I mean, you could fix that obviously. Austin Man recommends, and I am not familiar with his
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:39.840]   third one, but recommends three tools for the Pro Raw workflow. Hey, light, of course. So,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.920]   it understands Pro Raw now, right? They updated it so that they were using their own version.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.560]   Now they're going to support that Lightroom, which I'm just not going to use. I'm sorry,
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.440]   a Mac Adobe. I just pissed off. And this third one, Raw Power, which I'm not familiar with. Are
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.880]   you familiar with that? Anybody is? I had never heard this. Gentlemen, providers. Yeah.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.840]   I'm going to have to, he says, if you like the aperture, you'll like it. It works with photos,
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:10.720]   which is nice. And it's iOS and Mac. So, I will, I will try that and let you get back to you,
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.800]   let you know. It would be a nice fix-
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.560]   Uptated to support it. Did it? Oh, good. I made a photo. Yeah, I did.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:23.600]   It's a better Pro. Photo on the iOS. I think it's Pro. I'm not sure about photo.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.600]   Okay. Yeah. I would get, I have to ask Naomi because she's repping them now. I have to ask her,
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:35.680]   is photo, everything in photo encapsulated into Pro. So, if I use Pro on the Mac,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.160]   because there's no photo on the Mac, I'm getting all of those features,
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.680]   or are there really two different products? Last I checked, I believe everything is in there,
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:48.720]   but Naomi, I'll definitely know for sure. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like, it feels to me like,
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:54.480]   Pro is just everything. Yeah. And that's why they didn't bother putting out a photo version on the
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:20:02.720]   Mac, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's take a little break. We have lots more with our esteemed panel. It's so
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:09.840]   nice to see you, Rosemary. We want more of Rosemary. I can do this right now. Counter signed. Yeah.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:17.440]   Yeah. Well, it's always fun being here. I just say, some of you may get your wish.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:24.880]   That's all I can say. I don't want to say anything prematurely. No spoilers. No, baby Yoda spoilers.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.480]   No, those spoilers. Those spoilers. Are you sure? Airpods Mac spoilers are totally allowed.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.600]   They're spoiled already for me. Yeah. It's free.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:41.440]   I showed it. I brought to you by Forward Networks. Your network, I think you know by now, is mission
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.600]   critical to your business. Forward Networks is brilliant. I talked to these guys. They're four
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.880]   Stanford PhD students. They were actually graduate students when they developed Forward Networks
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:59.600]   seven years ago at Stanford. Partly because they had real feelings for how, what a rough life
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:05.520]   network operators had. And they thought, what if we applied the principles of modern software
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:13.600]   development to the network? What they actually have created is a mathematical model of your network,
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:20.800]   a digital twin, completely accurate and up to date. They do all sorts of interesting things to
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.120]   make sure that even if something new is put on the network, it's immediately incorporated into the
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.720]   model. It becomes your single source of truth. And I know you would think that that's something
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.960]   everybody has, but most companies don't. In fact, Forward Networks got to know the folks at Goldman
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.760]   Sachs. They applied it. Suddenly they see everything going on. They liked it so much.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:48.800]   They led their series C founding run in October. So did Mark Andreessen at Andreessen Horowitz.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:57.440]   He was blown away by it. This is a new tool that you absolutely have to have. You can verify that
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:03.760]   your network is correctly configured, that it's compliant with policies and regulations that it's
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:10.240]   behaving as you thought it was or not. And why it's not you can accurately predict the impact of a
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:17.520]   proposed change across every network traffic path. In fact, there's this behavior stiff that I think
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:23.120]   is so cool. If you, you know, you're a coder, you know, a diff is often used with text files to
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.080]   compare side by side two different text files. These diffs are for network behavior, side by side
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:34.640]   comparison in one quick view of whatever configuration file changes you're looking at. You know,
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:42.480]   how often does BGP and misconfigured BGP route all the traffic in the whole,
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.720]   didn't Cloudflare have this problem a while ago, where everything was routed through
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.240]   main by accident. And it can really destroy not only your network, but all your buddies networks.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.080]   Imagine if you could say, well, we're thinking of this BGP route and see side by side what that's
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:04.800]   going to do before you do it. Before you do it, you could search network behavior configuration
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.960]   and state network wide. It's a go to the website forward networks.com/twit
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:18.160]   and see a demo of what you see. It is incredible. This is a mathematically correct model of your
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:24.240]   network exactly. Their dashboard gives you insights with visualizations that you can easily
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.760]   consume and export. It can automatically create an always accurate network diagram. Can you imagine
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:35.280]   that? Just imagine that always accurate network diagram with full details about the complete
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:41.440]   topology of your network. You can, you can set check and customize policies for your entire network,
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.480]   make sure that your network is always compliant, proactively identify connectivity and security
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.160]   policy violations. You're going to get like on average 50% faster resolution of network
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:59.360]   trouble tickets, 90% faster fixes related to audit processes, 33% reduction in aborted network
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:06.480]   updates due to identified errors. This is what you've been looking for PayPal was having issues
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.840]   with the network. They considered building a better system. Instead, they turned to forward
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.560]   networks. They found all they needed was software that could find the trouble spots that saved them
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:23.600]   time and money. Bank of America, Verizon, Telstra. These are companies that use this
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:30.240]   to keep an eye on their massive complex networks so that they always know how it's operating.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:36.320]   If Verizon uses forward networks, you know it must get the job done. Get network automation
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.400]   and verification for your intent based network with forward networks. Your business
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:51.120]   absolutely depends on it. You've got to see the demo forward networks.com/twitforwardnetworksplural.com/twit.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.680]   They've got a new podcast. It's got a perfect name for this. Seeking truth in networking.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:02.720]   Listen to that. These are some of the smartest network guys I've ever talked to. I was so blown away.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.760]   Forward networks.com/twit. If you've got a complex network, you've got to manage it. I think about
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.840]   the folks at JPL, was at JPL, where somebody brought in a Raspberry Pi attached to the network
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.760]   and caused havoc. If you had forward networks, you'd immediately say, "Well, that's new. What's that?
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.800]   Why is that broadcasting packets all over the network?"
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.000]   Forward networks.com/twit. We thank them so much for their support.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.200]   Of Mac Break Weekly, you support us too by going to that address so that they know you saw it here.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:47.280]   Forward networks.com/twit. Apple says most staff will not return to office until June.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.880]   That seems like a reasonable time frame. Did you get your vaccine yet, Rosemary?
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.080]   No, they are rolling them out too considerably below a vulnerable person,
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.000]   so I'll let the people that really need it go first.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.040]   I thought you were an essential worker. You should get it.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.240]   Yes, but I also have this wonderful ability to completely and utterly stay in a very,
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.640]   very tiny bubble aka my own house.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   Yeah, you're safe. Tim Cook said it likely majority of teams won't be back before June
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.040]   2021.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.000]   Google postponed again, didn't they?
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.520]   Yeah, I think that's reasonable.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.200]   Yeah, I'm not going to even say it time.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.560]   I mean, I think that there's no reason that we don't need to, but it's not going to be till
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.600]   it's over. Yeah, so whatever that is.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.200]   And not still on hearing though there's a vaccine.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.800]   Yeah, I was going to say I'm just hearing from a lot of people that they've been told that they're
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.000]   not traveling next year. Everything's just going to be online. They're probably not going to be
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.360]   back in the office super regularly. I know my mom, she's been told that they will never be back
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.320]   in the office permanently. They'll be back in a few days a week.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.280]   But the vast majority of the time they're going to be at home.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.440]   So I can imagine that a lot of companies are probably going to do something similar,
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.760]   especially if they've taken a financial hit because one of the biggest costs out there is office
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.080]   space. Yeah, if we didn't have at least through 2026,
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.040]   I'd be Leo's garage.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.040]   I'd be doing this out of the house. You bet.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.640]   My worry is that this is going to go ahead, Renee.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.160]   Yeah, I was going to say we also now have to count on people actually getting the vaccine.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.200]   And these are people that we couldn't count. We're not not everybody, but a large part of
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.680]   some of these people. We're in this situation because a large part of you,
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.400]   we couldn't even be counted on to where a mask can keep their distance.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.960]   And we're already seeing the conspiracy theories on what do you mean the government is getting
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.040]   this that must be code. They must not really mean vaccine.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.880]   I have more optimistic. I have high hopes now that it's here and they're going to see people
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.440]   getting it and it's not nobody's going to get sick or die. There were a couple of allergic
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.760]   reactions in Britain, but I think those are just anaphylactic and they were treatable and
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:05.840]   they were fine. I think it's going to get it. I just don't know how long it's going to take
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:11.040]   before we have enough people vaccinated. Well, that's right. And that's why Tim Cook saying June.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.560]   Yeah, if that, yeah. Apparently Tim Cook is also saying you are not making a show about Gawker.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:23.520]   Did you see Alex's response to this? No. Yeah, Alex was all over this. He's like,
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.440]   I worked in this industry for 10 years. This is the, this is one of the smallest, least
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.240]   controversial stories I have ever seen. You should actually go spend some time in network TV and
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.320]   see all the decisions that it's killed. The show was being developed for Apple TV wasn't very far
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:44.160]   along. It was going to be called scraper, but it was about Gawker media. And we know that because
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:51.600]   the idea was sold to Apple TV by two veterans of Gawker, Corey Jefferson and Max Reed,
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.160]   Gawker's former editor in chief and Apple hired two more former Gawker editors. This is
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.680]   according to Ben Smith in the New York Times as writers. They had written several episodes.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.480]   I don't think they'd even begun principal shooting. And then Apple, an Apple executive
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:12.880]   got an email from the company's chief executive, Tim Cook, Mr. Cook, according to two people briefed
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:18.080]   on the email was surprised to learn his company was making a show about Gawker.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:24.160]   I certainly know love lost on my part for Gawker and you may remember
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:32.240]   Gawker outed Tim Cook in 2008 as gay. And so I don't, I don't blame him. In fact,
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:39.760]   anybody who's ever had an agalker point, it's a telescope at them is probably not a fan.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:47.760]   In the email, he expressed a distinctly negative view toward Gawker. The people said Apple proceeded
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:53.840]   to kill the project probably doesn't take much. Tim is so measured and even killed that if he just
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:30:00.000]   said, but he doesn't have to make it. I'm not really thrilled about this. That's probably all it took.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.240]   Right. Right. Yeah. I'm more bothered by other other stuff mentioned in the article. It's very,
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:14.240]   very true that yeah, any person is trying to create and doesn't have the $8.5 million per episode to
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:19.040]   foot up themselves and have to rely on another company to pay for it is going to deal with
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:25.920]   interference. But the stuff that bothers me is like universally you're not going to get any sort
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:33.440]   of content that in any way could even be misinterpreted as criticizing China because that's just the
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.120]   third rail or even just something as simple as, but wait a minute, you can't have, I understand
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:45.360]   that you have someone who failed to pick up their kid at soccer practice because they wanted to go
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.160]   see a movie and they're using an iPhone. We don't want iPhone users to be portrayed and that kind of
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.400]   a negative light. We don't want our iPhones to be destroyed. We don't want our iPhones to be dropped
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.480]   and mishandled. And that's the sort of stuff that's like, for heaven's sake, couldn't you do better
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:04.000]   than this? It's just not, it's not a, I don't think, like I said, it's not the unique thing to Apple,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.400]   but it is still not a good look for any company that does the sort of thing, least of which one
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.640]   that says, Oh, we're all about creativity and we're all about the human spirit and stuff like that.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:19.600]   Again, as long as the human spirit is not concerned about, doesn't want to do a movie about the Dalai
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:26.640]   Lama or even air, the Dalai Lama movie that Martin Scorsese made. I have to say a show about
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.680]   Gawker would be fascinating. I would be very interested in it because they were, you know,
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:37.680]   they, they both did some very, very good things and very, very sleazy things like outing Tim Cook.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:44.560]   So it would be a fascinating show, but there, you know what, Apple probably had points at which
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:50.160]   they could pass, passed at that point. The creators are now shopping it around. It'll somebody else
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.840]   will produce it for sure. It'll be a Snyder cut. But I agree with you, yeah, they'll be his
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:00.000]   ex-Nider version. I agree with you, Andy, I'm more concerned about this quote from a creative
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.520]   figure who worked with Apple, telling the New York Times that Eddie Q said, "The two things we
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:12.720]   will never do are hardcore nudity and China." So, but that's not again, not much of a surprise.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:20.000]   You know, it's funny. We were actually talking a little bit about this on iOS today. Micah
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.640]   Sargent and I were talking about the Apple One package and Apple Music compared to, say,
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:35.360]   Spotify and Apple TV compared to HBO, say. It came to me that Apple Arcade, for instance,
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:42.240]   compared to other games, that all of the products Apple creates kind of have the edges sanded off.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:51.120]   They're not edgy at all. They're very palatable. I mean, the TV's result.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.640]   The TV's result was really edgy. It was almost too much for me.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.760]   Oh, was it? Okay. See, I didn't see, see, because it didn't look that interesting.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:04.400]   But it was like, yeah. I feel like Apple, the thing that people said about HBO and its heyday was,
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.680]   they give creative, free-ranging, give them the money they need, and then they say, "Go do it,"
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:16.480]   and no notes. I feel like Apple gives maybe too many notes and has too many. There's too much
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:23.040]   at stake for Apple as a corporation for them to really be a place where creatives can flourish.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.160]   They never make Game of Thrones. I think that's a good question for the ghost.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:34.800]   And as a result, I feel like that hurts the products in the long run. That's why it's better
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:41.600]   for a creative company not to be owned by a big corporation. It hurts them a little bit because
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.720]   they have to consider, "Well, we don't want to piss off China," that kind of thing.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:54.640]   There's more that because more and more media companies are owned by AT&T and Comcast and Apple.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.640]   So this is not a huge investment. And China now too. They're huge investors. In a lot of the
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.840]   movies now, they have huge investments from a lot of the Chinese companies. I think even that article
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:08.320]   they said Disney has the same policies. Disney's probably even more strident about content that
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.560]   they'll kick stuff to Hulu if Lizzie McGuire says a curse word at this point.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.200]   I think the problem is that if you have one or two companies, that's fine because
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.520]   the competition will be between those companies, the ones that will. But increasingly, everyone
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.840]   is not doing that. I can't think of a single media company that would make a show that China
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.000]   doesn't like at this point. The NBA got in trouble for comments from players that they didn't like.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:37.200]   It's going to be tough going forward. I know that Disney is fairly strict on what
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.000]   actors can and can't do and what they can or can't have done before they appear in a Disney show.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.080]   So Anne Hathaway was a con appear, I think, in Disney Princess movies anymore because she
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.880]   did Brokeback Mountain and things like that. But I find it very shameful. That's shameful, by the way.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.680]   If that's the case, that's shameful. Well, I mean, that was the story going around back then.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.800]   I don't remember the details and I have no idea if it's actually true. But the point is,
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.280]   is they have certain standards. But Disney also owned a whole ton of other companies.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:15.040]   So as Ray said, they can kick it over to something else. Whereas Apple is purely the Apple brand,
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:20.320]   they don't have a whole bunch of other brands where they're farming these stuff out too.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:35.600]   And to be fair, if Apple chooses to make its branding that we are Pg13, we will dip a toe into
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.920]   our, if it's an important enough creator or an important enough property. But we don't want
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:48.800]   anything to do with anything that could get people not wanting to let their children use their
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   iPhones. I mean, that's, it's just that you just wish that this was an opportunity for Apple to
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.440]   plan its flag in a different way. It's too bad that they didn't decide to go that extra mile.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:07.200]   I mentioned Kundun, because this is what happens when Disney buys Fox Studios,
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:11.280]   these other studios. Now Martin Scorsese's movie about the Dalai Lama is probably,
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:16.080]   unless it winds up on, I don't think it'll even wind up on Hulu, it would be such a hot potato
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:21.840]   for Disney, this huge international brand to allow this movie to be aired on their streaming service
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:25.760]   that it's probably going to just disappear. And that's a very, very sad thing.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:32.320]   I agree 100%. That's why these big companies should not be allowed to own content creation.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.600]   It's really sad that you're ever going to get the best.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:42.640]   Yeah. Yeah. The EU is actually saying as well that they will try and shut down Apple TV plus
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:47.120]   over here, unless they have a certain percentage of EU content, because that is their requirement for
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:53.200]   people that in Canada. Yeah. Like we want 30% Canadian, you know that Leo from you,
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.600]   you think you're in that 30% UK content, 30% EU content. There's not a percent.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.920]   Right. Excuse me. If not for that, if not for that rule, we would not have Bob and Doug McKenzie.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.200]   I'm willing to back that rule with all my might. I don't know.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.040]   SCTV was a Canadian production. I think they were all Canadian. So they didn't really need
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:17.600]   Doug and Bob. They did. They actually, the story is that they were actually being
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.800]   dinged by the government saying that you need to have more Canadian content. And Rick Moranis
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.960]   and Dave Thomas was a joke. Oh, what do you want us to do? Like have two hosers and toaks and
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.280]   toaks and drinking beers and Ryan back bacon. And they said that would do nicely. And so
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:38.560]   only for the Canadian broadcasts, they would just get a minimal crew and do a half hour of just
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.720]   totally improvisation of these two characters, put it in the very, very end and call it Canadian
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   content. It was Canadian content. It was all produced in Canada, wasn't it? Yeah. I think
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.600]   that's a good sounding story, but I'm not sure I buy it. The entire hour versus Canadian content.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.720]   I mean, call for help. When we did call for help in Toronto, it just had to be I was the only
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.920]   American involved with the production. We didn't have to specifically talk about
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.080]   YouTube Canada or something. Well, the first thing is when they saw your last name,
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:13.600]   La Porte, they just assumed you were a figure. Yes. French Canadian from Montreal, of course.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.640]   And the putting portraiture of La Porte, you see? Actually, the E thank you, EU, because
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:25.120]   while our regulatory environment here in the US seems to be up and down, although the FTC
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:31.360]   as I mentioned, the FTC has just reached out to 10 tech companies, including Amazon and Facebook
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:39.520]   saying, "Can we know a little bit more about what you do with this data?" Ironically, it's not an
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:47.520]   investigation. It's a study. So it has no legal teeth to it, but it's a study. I guess. Meanwhile,
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:55.600]   the EU has announced sweeping new rules that could force breakups and hefty fines for big tech
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:01.280]   companies. This is from CNBC. Companies like Apple and Google will also have to allow users to
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.800]   uninstall apps that originally came with their device, failure to comply. Penalties as high as
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:14.000]   10% of the annual revenue, worldwide revenue. That's a good penalty. I just wish I wish that
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.640]   you could combine until the EU has got such a blunt weapon, but I just wish that they could be
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:25.440]   sharply. Well, first, I love those articles that showed Mark Zuckerberg just so upset that he got
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:29.760]   called in front of the FTC after he did everything he could do to just hand over the reins to the
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.240]   conspiracy theorists. If I just let the top 10 articles on Facebook every day be complete
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:41.360]   utter nonsense, they'll leave me alone and no, they didn't. So I think sometimes you get what
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:45.520]   you have coming to you. But the EU is they're really good at enforcement, but they just seem
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.360]   not really to understand the technology behind it. Some of the things they want are unfeasible.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.440]   You get to the point where you have to be allowed to be able to disinstall all the apps, including
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.400]   the app store, and then at that point, how do you get them back? And it was the same thing.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.120]   I'm still selling the right to disable my phone if I want to. They said there was not enough
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.960]   competition for browsers. And so now we have Chrome. I mean, that's basically all they did was give
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:17.520]   the hand the world over to Chrome. I don't have Fenris or a slave near anymore. And we only have
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.880]   one rendering engine now used to have four before they got involved. Yeah, regulation is always
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:30.560]   a double edged sword. But at the same time, I feel like that's the last thing left that we can do
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.640]   about these companies that are becoming completely dominant. The proposed EU legislation is the
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:45.040]   Digital Markets Act. And then the Digital Services Act, DMA would affect Apple. DSA would affect
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:50.640]   Google, Facebook and others. And of course, Mark Zuckerberg immediately took the opportunity to
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:58.320]   say we hope we hope the DMA will also set boundaries for Apple. Apple controls an entire ecosystem for
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:03.680]   to look pay no attention to us. Look over there. It controls an entire ecosystem from device to
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:08.400]   App Store and apps and uses this power to harm developers and consumers as well as large platforms
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:14.240]   like Facebook. And in Montreal, the big story was that Pornhub got hit really hard. They even got
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.560]   their credit card merchants took away. And their response is, why are you bugging us? FaceTime has
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.680]   a hundred times more objectionable content than we do. FaceTime or Facebook? Facebook, sorry,
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.400]   Facebook has a hundred times more objectionable content than we do. Yeah, everybody's shooting
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.800]   at everybody else. Let's hope the regulators have some sense and don't listen to that.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:39.120]   Still, they need to, regulators need to have the ability to really hit them with the ugly stick
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.520]   when they have to. One of the reasons why Facebook is getting hit so hard by the United States right
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:50.640]   now is that the regulatory agencies have taken the usual tech, which is the only practical
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:55.040]   tactic to take, which is we have this ability to have this ruling against you. We would rather
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:00.000]   negotiate a settlement to avoid you using your trillion dollars to keep this in litigation for
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.680]   five, six, seven or eight, nine years. We want an effective improvement for the users. And Facebook
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.600]   has been violating two different consent decrees they agree to and it's sad that they have to
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:17.920]   they have to screw up three times in succession before there is an even a hint that they'll actually
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:23.440]   be made to feel the pain. We need to have the ability to the government that's regulating these
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.720]   industries has to have the ability to hurt them beyond the ability for them to fight back with
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.080]   money because we've for 20 years now, we've been trying nothing and it hasn't worked out.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:43.440]   So we should try something now. It could be it could be a horrible mess or it could be great.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:49.040]   Well, in many ways, we can hopefully the horrible mess will wind up with will be less intense in
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.680]   the horrible mess we're in right now. Yeah, maybe. Unfortunately, yeah, this could be the chemotherapy
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.800]   of a regulation. Yeah, well, that's a good way to put it. We'll lose our hair, but at least we'll
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.360]   survive. It killed me kill kill the kill the bad stuff faster than it will kill the good stuff.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:09.920]   And then you stop before you go too far. Yeah. Can you make a series anybody got serious around?
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:13.200]   Can you make it quick like a duck? Yes, I can.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.200]   You can ask it. You can ask it to what an elephant sounds like.
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:25.680]   We can make whale noises to save the world from Star Trek 4.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:32.880]   Wow. So these are animal sounds now. Let me see if we can hear. Let me let me let me
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.840]   how do I ask for it? I just go. What does an elephant sound like?
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:47.280]   Now just put a picture up. I don't know if it's out or not yet. There was an announcement,
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:53.120]   but I don't know if it's an I have to press a play button. I have four and a half gigabyte
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.080]   download that of an iOS update. Oh, yeah. You don't have to do it. In my case,
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:01.760]   it's probably in there. Let me try it this one. What does a duck sound like?
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:19.680]   That's what a duck sounds like? That's not what Looney Tunes taught me. What about quack, quack?
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.920]   I mean, at least it's not a Canadian. What does a duck sound like? It's scary.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:36.080]   It's cow. It's not working that well. So you can say, Apple says there's hundreds of options.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:48.160]   What does an oboe sound like? Yeah. So sometimes it gives me a picture and a play button.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:54.880]   Is that an oboe or an Odo from D space nine? What is an Odo? What does an Odo sound like?
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.680]   How about this one? What does a humpback whale sound like?
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:09.760]   No, see, it's just it's not playing it. It's just giving me a button. I thought it was just going to play.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:15.200]   Oh, Rosemary.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:23.520]   I mean, if you have a home pod, then it should just auto-pilot. Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:28.960]   That's right. So on an iPhone or iPad, you get a picture of the animal and link to more information.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.280]   But it makes sense. If you didn't have a screen, it would
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.280]   of course we're just taking the firetruck sound like. Yeah.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:44.080]   Yeah, see, I'm not getting an audio sample.
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:53.360]   Hey, that's not how the firetruck sounds like it's a horn.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:58.320]   Well, actually firetruck sound different in every country. That's true.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.120]   That's what I was going to say. I was wondering if it's localized. Like, if you
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.520]   went to the US of A, there's a go.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:10.080]   What does a play in the UK sound like? So that'd be useful.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:15.520]   It sounds like stop, but we'll all stop again. No. Here's what I found on the web.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:18.080]   I mean, today when I was driving it, just went
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.760]   and I just pulled over to the side of the road and the policeman passed.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.200]   So anyway, you could try a few things. A cat, a lion, an eagle, a kooka bura.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.120]   Apparently there's hundreds.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:42.160]   But I think honestly, it's going to confuse kids if you ask for what a duck sounds like
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:45.200]   and you hear that, you should just go quack, quack.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:51.680]   Then kids will understand. I'm just saying, you know,
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.280]   it reminds me of an article I read many years ago where somebody was saying that
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.960]   Siri was one of her son's best friends and her son has a form of autism and just gets
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:08.320]   very sucked into topics and asks questions for hours. And obviously, as humans, some of us
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.960]   are not so great at handling that and also with jobs, you know, you have to go and do other things.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.760]   And Siri was great because it could answer old or tried to answer all the questions and gave
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:24.080]   links and he was able to learn loads of things through Siri. And I can imagine that this
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.640]   for kids and everybody else is going to be great fun.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.840]   My God kids before they could talk before they could talk before they could read or write would
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.680]   use Siri to send and receive eye messages with their parents. They didn't have to read it enough
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.720]   right. They would just say they would see it. Siri would read it to them. They would dictate
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:44.160]   their response and they were totally using all the technology. Consider the source in this next
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:51.760]   story, the New York Post. Jessica Johnson is a real estate broker in Wilson, Connecticut.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:58.560]   She has a six year old son George. She did not realize that George
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:08.160]   was playing a sonic on the iPad, sonic forces and buying add on boosters. He started in July with
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:17.520]   buck 99 red rings eventually moved up to $99 gold rings. On July 9th, a day when Jessica was working
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:24.320]   in the next room, there were charges, 25 of them totaling $2,500. She says, it's like my six year
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:31.840]   old was doing lines of cocaine and doing bigger and bigger hits. Eventually, Chase told her it's
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:39.520]   probably fraud, but eventually she figured out it wasn't fraud. It's George. He ended up charging
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:52.640]   $25,000 of merchandise, actually $16,000 of merchandise on virtual gold rings.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:49:01.520]   When she contacted Apple, Apple said, "Oh gee, this is
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.760]   older than six months. If you had told it about us about it, then we could have refunded you.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:14.800]   It's too late." She says, "Apple said tough. They told me because I didn't call within 60 days of
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.040]   the charges. They can't do anything." She said, "I didn't call because Chase told me it was probably
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:26.480]   fraud." She says, "There's a setting you should have known." Apple says, "You should have known.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:31.440]   There's a setting." There's no not setting. I've seen a lot of reporting on this and there's
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:38.080]   not a setting. You have to go out of your way to let someone rock a plan. I'm not blaming the
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.640]   user. It'll still ask you for a password after 15 minutes unless you set them up with touch.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:49.120]   I thought the she went through the extra length to let George wouldn't bother her.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.520]   Yes. George took it in the role of Touch ID. Then she enabled purchases with Touch ID,
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.840]   which I never want to blame a user. It should never be a user's problem. I feel like I want to
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:04.000]   blame these games for having these in purchases. I feel like that's where every ounce of my anger
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.520]   and rage should go. Apple allowing them on the sword to begin with. It's basically handing
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.400]   the kid a key to your bank account with these things at that point.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.280]   I do think Apple should probably, after all this publicity, just say, "Okay, fine."
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:20.080]   But it's going to come out of their pocket because I'm sure they've paid Sega
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:26.320]   already for this. That's the problem 60 days later. The money already went there.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:32.720]   Why isn't there a $20,000 to a game? That shouldn't be possible if you want to.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:41.600]   Exactly. That's what I just said. Why isn't there some sort of a crash guard that you have to
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.600]   disable in order to spend more than a certain amount? That has nothing to do with the game
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:52.480]   code itself. You don't have to do any settings. If this crash guard, if this upper limit
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:57.280]   bothers you, then you have to go figure out how to eliminate this $200 a month.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.480]   Nobody should be allowed to spend $16,000 in six months on a game of paper.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:06.720]   That's it. Just not even... It should be no way through it. That's it, period.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.680]   That's ridiculous. The question is, where do you draw the line with something like this?
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:17.680]   For example, there are great pro apps out there that genuinely are worth the money.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.680]   And you buy a couple of those in a month. You're starting a new business,
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.080]   save, for example. You have an omnigraphy and an omniglass plan.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:28.560]   You go out when you buy ferrite and a bunch of other things as well.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:35.440]   There's $20 here, $100 there. It does add up very quickly. That's a legitimate use case.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:42.880]   Obviously, in this case, you should not give your children access to just buy things on your device.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.520]   It's got your credit card information. If it works in New York Post, I might give it more credence.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.920]   I feel like probably... There was a story about a kid who was just ordering off Amazon all the time,
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:56.080]   too. Once you give them unfettered access to a device that has your credit card information
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.880]   pre-built into it... It's your problem not Amazon's. It's like the kid that ordered the giant banana
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:08.640]   through an echo. They wanted the banana. Banana toy or something. And then this giant banana appeared.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:16.080]   The difference here though is that these games, they really are programmed with psychological
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:23.280]   hacks. They are programmed. They're not wheels like casinos. They hit you with these offers at a
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.880]   time when they know that your brain chemistry is not really at its most critical thinking part.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.960]   And more of the, "Oh, that means I can't have the little hula girl unicorn fire blaster."
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:40.000]   So the amount of manipulation means that I think there should be some sort of limits on
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.040]   above and beyond what the game controllers want to put in.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:48.080]   I would gladly pay $100 for the lighthouse on my Animal Crossing island.
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:52.880]   See? It's you Leo. It's you and P. Did he was spending 10 grand on like blinky blink every weekend.
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:58.880]   But two Nintendo's credits. They don't have in-app purchases in that game. They could be making...
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:05.280]   They're forgoing, "I am certain billions of dollars in revenue." But once you buy the game,
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.320]   everything else is free and that's that. And I think that that's... By the way, I'm so addicted
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:15.120]   to that game. I think it's a good thing. When you look at what Pokemon Goa has taken in and what
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.520]   Fortnite has taken in, just these sheer amount of money and all they're getting is digital goods.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:25.600]   Like they're getting emotes and skins and Pokecoins and like nothing of real value.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.200]   It's stupefying how much money they're pulling in on those transactions.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.120]   You make a really excellent point that in order for that to have happened without the
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:39.120]   mother's interaction, because as to buy is on by default, she would have had to take extra steps
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:46.880]   to give that kid access. Yeah. She also probably set that iPad up for herself rather than setting
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.920]   it up for George. Because if she set it up for him, then it would automatically send all
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:58.800]   purchase requests through to her. And so then it would have popped up on her phone. And yeah,
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:02.960]   I can see that being annoying and interrupting if you're trying to get your work done. But
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:08.880]   unfortunately parenting is not the easiest job. Now that's not to say that there are
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:15.200]   lots of other things that you can do with your children. But if you can't say, hey,
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:21.280]   sweetie, don't do this because Mummy's working. We'll look at this later. Then I think you need
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:26.480]   to potentially set up your iPad differently. Renee, have you ever tried to figure out how much
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:31.280]   you've spent on Pokemon Goa? Well, I mean, up until this March, it was all going straight to
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:39.360]   to mobile nations in future. So it was fine. Now it's on your card. Yeah. But now like a
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.280]   comp through a confluence of many things, I don't have I don't have to write about it anymore.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.440]   Like it was the second most popular topic on I'm more after iPhones. Right. Like before iPads,
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:52.080]   before Apple watches all of those things. So it was it was well worth it. Lisa,
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   then you probably know though that we have now higher trainer levels than 40. Yes. Lisa had been
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:05.680]   playing hard ever since she got to 40. And I thought by God, as soon as they expand that,
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:12.400]   she's going to go to level 60. Right. She's at 41. It's hard. But if you would like to play with Lisa,
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:18.960]   I offer now her trainer code so you can become her friend. She's very active.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.480]   And she very much wants to get to level 60. What is the top? Is it 60? What is it? It's 50 right
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:29.520]   now. But the thing is that it's not just hard. They made it tedious. Like I saw level 43 is like,
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:35.120]   you have to catch 430 Pokemon in a day and do 430 of something else. And like, I don't mind if
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.680]   there's a variety of things, but doing one thing 430 times in a day, I'm just never going to get.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:47.200]   I know. That's why I play animal planet. Because once you've mined all four fossils and hit six rocks,
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.560]   watered your garden, you shouldn't be the challenge. You shouldn't have to be
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:59.840]   angry to go to the next to her. No grinding. Her trainer code 14072955505. And she's going to call
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:04.240]   me in about a minute saying, what the hell? All these people are asking to be my friend. What's going
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:10.240]   on? She wanted this. So I'm doing it for you, honey. That's your Christmas gift. Enjoy.
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:18.480]   If only that were true. All right, let's take a little break. And then you guys are going to
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:25.040]   suggest a Christmas gift. I should mention for all of our family or Hanukkah gift or Kwanza gift or
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.960]   a Festivus gift, I should mention that next week is our best of episode. So we will not be here
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:38.240]   December 22nd as we get ready for the Christmas season. We'll be back though on the 29th. We are
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:44.880]   doing a show. I should warn you, Renee and Andy will be doing a show on the 29th. And I think
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.560]   that's going to be kind of a look back. The 22nd will be the best of. But the 29th, I think maybe
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:56.160]   a look back at some of the most interesting and important Apple stories, trends in 2020 and things
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:00.400]   to look ahead for 2021, something like that. It's not going to be a New Year. So it's fine.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:04.400]   They won't do a New Year early. They won't announce a Mac Pro or anything like that.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.800]   We're doing it like one of those clip shows on a sitcom where it's like we got trapped in an
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.360]   elevator. We thought, you know, Renee, this is just like back in February when you were talking about
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:18.160]   Apple Silicon. We did that next week. We did that. I got all dressed up for it.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:23.040]   Our show today brought to see us. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say, you're going to see us in
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:28.080]   February before we knew it. 2020 was going to be like, Oh my God, I know. So young. So innocent.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.760]   That's the funny thing about doing these best steps is it starts innocent.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:39.840]   And it gets. Oh my. Oh, now I don't know what we're in our second.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:43.680]   So our concerns will be so silly and pathetic and February and January.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:53.200]   We won't know. Our show today is brought to you by Twilio. Twilio is built by developers for
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:58:00.480]   developers. If it's time to build, if it's time to add new ways to communicate with your customers,
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:06.480]   Twilio is the first place you can go. Engage customers on any channel, anywhere they are
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:13.760]   from text messages to emails to phone calls to video and more all in one single powerful platform.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:20.160]   Twilio is big. They power more than 795 billion interactions across channels with
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:28.160]   five nines of uptime 99.999 percent uptime, three billion phone numbers available across
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:34.560]   more than 100 countries. Some of the biggest in the business use Twilio Shopify uses Twilio
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:40.400]   to run their entire global contact center. More than a million customers. They use Twilio's
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:47.760]   programmable context center solution for that Twilio Flex. Blue Apron uses Twilio to power
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:54.480]   their newsletter emails. That's the Twilio Send Grid. Netflix uses Twilio for two-factor
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:00.480]   authentication. I use Twilio's Authy app for my two-factor authenticator. If you're on Uber or
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:04.960]   Lyft and you're getting deliveries or rides, those text messages that come to say your
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:11.280]   driver's on his way, that's Twilio. Of course, it's Twilio. Products and operations teams use
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:15.760]   Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their users inside applications all the time,
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:21.200]   ranging from account notifications with text messaging to chatbots to securing online accounts
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:26.240]   with two-factor authentication. I found a really interesting Twilio application.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.640]   The other day I was reading Hacker News, kapish.fm. This is a way you could podcast
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:41.200]   by talking into your phone. Of course, they streamed the whole world and it's based on Twilio.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:50.560]   Twilio is truly an amazing product. I want you to check it out. Go to twilio.com. If you know how
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:57.040]   to build a web application, you can become a sophisticated telecom engineer. You don't have to be,
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:02.480]   you don't have to know all the ins and outs of the telecom system. Just a few lines and boom,
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:11.600]   you've got apps that text, call, chat, video conference, chatbots, emails. It's just an amazing
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:18.480]   tool built by developers, for developers. It is easily the most popular way to do this. I've had
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:23.200]   a Twilio account for years just for my hobby stuff. Strengthen your customer relationships
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:33.680]   by uniting communications across your entire business. Go to twilio.com. Twilio.com. It's time
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:43.440]   to build with Twilio. Thank you, Twilio, for your support of Mac Break Weekly. You are our guest
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:48.240]   this week. Rosemary Orchard, so you get to start our picks of the week.
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:53.280]   All right. Well, my pick of the week, I'm going to be thanking a friend for this because I was
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:59.280]   forwarded a tweet which contained the blob orchestra. Oh, the blob orchestra. What's that?
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:06.320]   The blob orchestra. It is a little thing from Google where you get four blobs on your screen.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:13.760]   And it will walk you through how to play with the blobs. So you've got a bass. Let me turn on my
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.440]   sound so we can hear what I'm doing here. Yeah. And then you have a tatter.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:25.520]   And if you drag forwards and backwards as well, then you also get a different mouse.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:36.240]   And each additional blob increases all of them sitting together if you've pulled a leftmost one.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:47.360]   And it's cute. And it's fun. And then when you're done with the tutorial, this is the best part of
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:51.840]   it. Yes. You can record in the bottom left, but over in the bottom right, click on the Christmas
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:02:00.160]   tree. Oh, no. They're guessing. There's snow and then you can pick a festive song and they will sing.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:11.840]   And I just thought this was incredibly cute. This is so cute. And you can mute each
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.480]   individual blob as well. So if you're interested in how the music is constructed, then you can just
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:23.040]   meet three of them, say, and just figure out which one is doing what. Can I say that every
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.440]   single time there's been a commercial or I've been playing with this for the last two hours
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.000]   since you talked about it before we started doing the show. This is just the most fun thing I have
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:38.240]   just heard. I haven't told about it in no longer. Oh, thank you. This is great. I love it. This is
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:44.160]   so good. It also, my friend Chris, who forwarded the link to me because otherwise I would have
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:49.440]   skipped it. I hadn't noticed it on Twitter, but I just thought they're very cute. And also, I like
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:55.520]   the fact that you can make your own with it and record that and then share it. So if you've got
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:00.720]   some time this holiday season, you can try making your own carols. Is there anything Google can't do?
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:07.440]   They're amazing. You know what, E, you don't find Google. Just play another song in the blob
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:13.040]   opera. It's arts and culture dot Google dot com. It's one of their experiments, the blob
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:19.360]   opera. You probably could Google blob opera and go straight to it. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Probably.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.200]   Andy and I go pick it. Thank you, Rosemary. Andy and I go pick of the week.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.640]   I changed my pick of the week after after Rosemary told me about what her pick of the week was going
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:34.560]   to be. My pick of the week this week, remembering this is the last one before Christmas to a perfect
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:39.200]   Christmas recordings that I rely on the Christmas season all the time. First one is my favorite
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.920]   Christmas album of all time. Ella Fitzgerald, which is you a swinging Christmas. Absolutely.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:50.000]   It is just for decorating the house for wrapping gifts for unwrapping gifts for just having like
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.360]   the house party. There is no, but it is a it is a swinging Christmas with Ella Fitzgerald recording
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:02.880]   this. And Apple music also has the expanded edition. So there's more Ella to love as as though we were
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.600]   joyous enough with the tracks that had already been released. The other thing is that this has
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.000]   been a tradition we were talking before about like, you know, the cassette adapter in the car.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.760]   I for ever since I had ever since like 25 years ago, when I had a car with a cassette deck in it,
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.760]   my holiday tradition has been the audio book version of Patrick Stewart's one man show one man show
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.480]   performance of a Christmas Carol. You can get it on audible so he can use your credits or he just
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:36.160]   buy it outright. It is the most incredible like it's it's it's he he has been doing even when he was
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:40.480]   doing Star Trek. He was this is one of his pet projects where he would do a one man show he would
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.760]   rent out at theater and do his one man reading of a Christmas Carol doing all the voices Tiny Tim,
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:53.200]   the women, the men, the Scrooge, everything. And you can see how perfect every single and considered
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:58.800]   every single line of this is. And God bless him. They they put him into a studio so he could record
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:05.200]   it. And I've gone from the cassette to buying it on audible to having CDs that I could rip and
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:13.920]   have a copyright free. Excuse me, content protection free. And it just is an absolute joy hearing him
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.880]   perform this year after year after year is something exceptionally special. It's probably my my
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:27.520]   favorite version of a Christmas Carol. All media combined. Nice. $10.46 or use your audible credit.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:34.160]   You pick this every year every year. I mean to do it and I forget. So I'll do it.
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:39.120]   That's what this year. You'll you'll you'll thank yourself. I get I get a credit in a week. So
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:46.080]   highest possible recognition. Nice. Very nice. Thank you, Andy. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:51.360]   So I've got to and the first one is just something I've been trying to do for months and for a variety
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:59.680]   of reasons. Couldn't get it done as early as I wanted. But I'm putting up masks on my channel
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:04.320]   and all the profits, all the proceeds, everything we get from them is going to go to the covid relief
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:08.960]   efforts. We haven't found the exact place they're going to go yet. So if anyone has any recommendations
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:13.440]   because it churned out that that was one of the complicated parts is that there are so many places
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:20.560]   from food banks to just direct support to some of the bigger agencies. So we're trying to find
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:25.840]   the most helpful place we can go. So if anybody has any recommendations, any favorites, please let
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:31.360]   me know. But they're available now and every penny we make from them is going to go to as much covid
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:38.560]   relief as we possibly can. And the second one is Apple rolled out a new search engine option
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:44.880]   this week with the software updates. Previously, you had Google, whatever was left of Yahoo and
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:49.040]   DucktuckGo. And now they've added Ecosia. I think that's the right way to explain it to
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:55.040]   a pronounce it. It's EC Planet Earth SIA. And you can set this as your default search engine. And
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:01.040]   then any revenue generated from ads shown in the search engine will be donated to trees. And I've
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:05.520]   seen some back and forth of them. People were asking some questions and they don't just plant
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:09.680]   it and go. They stick around. They try to make sure those trees are viable, that they're planted
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:14.640]   in responsible areas that they're cared for, they're nurtured, they get things like water and sunlight.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:21.680]   So if you don't want to use Google, DucktuckGo is just not your thing. You don't mind ads,
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:27.920]   but you'd prefer the revenue go not to a giant internet corporation, but to reforesting the
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:32.560]   planet that we all depend on for oxygen. You can use Ecosia. And then every time you see a search
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:36.320]   and see an ad, a little bit of those gate goes to making the planet green again.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:43.440]   Is the search pretty good? I hate to be to pick on it. I find it better than DucktuckGo.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:47.920]   Of course, it's not as good as Google is because Google has such a head start, such a scale and
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:53.120]   just such good algorithms. But I think if you are not stuck on Google or you don't particularly
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:08:04.080]   like Google, it's a good option to have. Very nice. Ecosia from, I guess they're German because it's
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:12.000]   GMBH, seven languages, and you can now add it to your iPhone. Sometimes Google is too good.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000]   Like you get too many results or the result is too Google. And so I like sometimes the old days
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.880]   Leo back when we had all the different search engines from Altavista to go through. I like to
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.920]   spread my searches around now. I feel the same way, but I also feel like there is nothing as good
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:32.480]   as Google, which is unfortunate. I want to try Ecosia. It's very easy to change a search engine
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:41.120]   in the Safari settings. I've just done that. I should mention if you have an M1, Safari is mind
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:48.320]   bogglingly fast. It's kind of feels like what? Like, have I been suffering all this time?
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:56.000]   Google very quickly did an M1 native version of Chrome. Firefox has just announced that their M1
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.720]   native version of Firefox is out. That's the browser I use because it's open source. I want
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:05.840]   to support them. I feel like they're struggling a little bit financially. And I really want,
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:10.560]   I think it's so important that we have some diversity. At least we have WebKit with Safari and
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:15.760]   Chromium-based browsers with Google Edge and others. But I think let's keep Firefox
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:21.520]   brave too. It's an option too. I just a big fan. And all the plugins and extensions and the privacy
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:28.000]   focus, which by the way, I think Firefox probably does the best of blocking Facebook crap.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:34.320]   So I'm really, really happy. I'm trying to use almost everything native on the M1. I don't want
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:39.120]   to even do any resettive stuff. So now that there's a native version of Firefox, I'll see
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:44.720]   the battery uses. I have to say Safari is mind-bendingly good. Did you see the
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:53.920]   Bruha-ha of the weekend, Leo? About Chrome and Keystone? Yeah, I did. And it was BS as far as I
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:59.840]   could tell, although before I figured that out, I did delete Chrome and Keystone and all the
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:07.040]   com.google.chromestuff on my Mac, just in case. There's been a plot twist. So I was
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.560]   involved in that too, because I saw Lauren's tweet and I've been having the exact same problem.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:15.520]   Like, oh, bad trying to render videos. The premise was that I wanted to throw my Mac.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:19.360]   Even if you didn't have Chrome running, Keystone was always running in the background.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:24.320]   And even maybe if you uninstall Google, it might still be running. I'm not sure.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:27.760]   So it was even worse than that. So the hard part was that it looked to Lauren,
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.920]   people who don't know Lauren, he worked at the GL stack at Apple. He invented literally invented
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.240]   Polter refresh. He made Tweety, which became the original Twitter client. And he also made
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:41.200]   Letterpress. And what it would look to him like was happening is that Keystone would try to update,
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:45.920]   somehow fail. So it wouldn't appear in Activity Monitor, but it would be enough to rev up
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.840]   Windows Server trying to launch over and over again. And that would suck down resources.
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:54.480]   Oh, because the Windows Server bug is a well-known bug, right? But maybe it's Chrome.
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:56.640]   This is a different one, though. Yeah. It was a new one. Oh, okay.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:01.600]   Yeah. So and maybe it may not be, it could be Chrome. It may be a way that Chrome is interacting
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:06.000]   with the newer versions of Windows Server. It could be that something unrelated is causing
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.080]   a problem. We don't know, but it solved his problem. It has solved my problem.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:14.240]   And I was going to control my computer. Ben Thompson did it. And he's no dummy either.
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:17.840]   And he said it completely fixed. He was ready to buy a new computer. Wow.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.320]   Completely fixed his problem. And the Chrome team, they are fantastic. The Chrome team
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:26.560]   was engaging immediately. They were all over this. And they've now put up,
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.080]   they've filed their own bug for it. They're asking people who are going to install it
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:34.960]   to take a snapshot before and after. Oh. Yeah. We're mentioned in there as
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:40.400]   anecdotalers, which I think is amazing. Well, their first reaction, I saw this first
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:47.280]   on Reddit, their first reaction was to poo poo it. And there was a lot of traffic on Reddit saying,
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.960]   this is BS, blah, blah, blah. So I, but I did, it's funny because I did it anyway.
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.720]   Because why not? Decrome your, Decrome your Macintosh anyway.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.920]   But it's not Chrome though. It's Keystone because like if you use Chromium and you're
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.680]   not using that up, and there's a whole other thing because that updater is basically
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:09.360]   non-consensual. And some people believe you should have consent to update on,
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:13.360]   especially on the Mac, like with Sparkle or the App Store. Well, the fact that it's not visible
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:18.880]   in the activity monitor, I think is not great. It will show up when it's actually doing the update
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.120]   part, but there, but that has to spawn through launch D. It's a whole complicated thing. And
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:27.760]   that's part of it is that it's so opaque that it's like dark matter. You can only measure it
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:35.120]   by its effects on other things. Right. Lauren has put together a post at Chrome is bad.com.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.480]   He was so angry. He shouldn't have written this when he was this angry though. I mean,
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:46.160]   this is the tone down version. So what part is that? It's Lauren Richter, who is a well-respected
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:53.040]   guy in the Mac developer community though. So what is Lauren's, he does, he doesn't do
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.120]   anything anymore. I think he just, he's building his own. But I honestly, like he rewrote UI
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:01.600]   kit on the Mac himself before Apple Day. I'm pretty sure he's rewritten it in WebGL by now.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:05.280]   Right. He's a smart guy. He's super like 9000 IQ. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:08.800]   He says Safari is good. It's already on your Mac. Use it.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:14.080]   Do you Rambo said he can't find anything wrong with it? So like there's different people having
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.640]   different opinions that I really respect. But that just shows how hard it is to diagnose things
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.800]   on modern computer systems with millions of individual components bouncing off each other
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:27.600]   all the time. Keystone. I was wondering about the name and then I remember Keystone was the original,
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:34.640]   is the name of the group that is the Google Maps data is Keystone. And so I was feeling it's
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:40.880]   an ancient technology that started with Google Earth and then has slowly migrated to other Google
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:46.640]   products. Wired called it evil 11 years ago just because of how it worked with Google Earth.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.600]   Wow. And Mac Observer had an article about it five years ago showing that you could also turn off
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.160]   the like set the update time to zero. But I worry about that because if you're leaving Chrome running,
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:00.240]   it should get updated. Otherwise it's a big security problem. So I wouldn't recommend
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:05.040]   you just disable Keystone and keep using Chrome. Yeah. I just got rid of everything that had the
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:12.480]   word Google in it. Very happy. Didn't bother me one day. I would love to put it on. I just if so
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:16.480]   far I haven't had that problem again. If I have it back, I'll put Chrome back on in a hot second.
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.640]   I just can't afford to have like beach balls over and over again. I'm trying to do a video.
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:25.200]   The reason I put Chrome on in the first place was because one it was a one native. But two,
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.160]   I wanted to play Stadia. It looks like it turns out it's the best way to play Cyberpunk is to play
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.840]   it instead on a server by Stadia. Because if you run on your car. People are coding for Chrome
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:39.360]   now instead of the web, which is another problem that we're going to have to see around. Oh kidding.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:47.760]   Yeah. So this is an interesting controversy which Google seems to be responding to. So that's
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:51.680]   which I'm really happy about. That's all you can ever ask. Yeah. I'm an
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:57.040]   Oklahoma install Firefox. But I have to say Safari is so fast. It's like,
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:04.960]   why would you use anything else? It's pretty good. Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:12.000]   this episode of Mac Break Weekly. Renee Ritchie is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. He does right
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.680]   from time to time for I'm more effective. He wrote that article about all of his Keystone
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:21.120]   controversy for I'm more anything else you want to plug your Apple talk show you do with the great
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:26.560]   Georgia Dow. Yeah. And I managed to convince it. Well, she didn't take that much. She started
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:30.160]   her own YouTube channel now. She hasn't got any videos up yet. But she's going to start doing a
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:34.960]   lot of the stuff that she talks about on psychology and things like that on YouTube in digestible
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.600]   format. So it should be fun. Good. Very nice. Thank you. Renee Andi and Akko, when are you going
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:46.480]   to be on WGBH Boston next? This week I'm on Thursday at 1 20 in the afternoon for about half an hour.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.920]   As usual, go to WGBH news.org to stream it either live or later. Usually you usually have my
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:55.600]   second up about three hours later. I do have a couple of other things to plug this week.
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:02.800]   Now that I have now that I have an M1 Mac and from a recent Mac that is capable of streaming. Well,
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:08.080]   I decided to see what streaming works on this thing. So I'm doing a live stream on YouTube tonight
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:13.120]   if you're watching live at 8 p.m. You can get the link off of my Twitter feed. Just go to
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:18.640]   Anatko, spelled my last name. That's the cost of admission. Also our friend Alex Lindsey invited
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:24.480]   me to be a guest on his office hours stream on Thursday. So that's going to be like an 11
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.560]   11 o'clock Eastern time, 8 a.m. Western time. So yeah, I'm going to have to shave every day,
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.920]   which is not usually how I try to work things out. That's great. And when you talk to Alex,
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:39.280]   tell them to answer my email. I've been begging him to come on the show. I don't know. He's never
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:44.000]   answered it. So I don't know what's going on. Alex, like many of us no longer can see. He only
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.600]   tweets now. There's so much crap. Yeah. He got rid of voicemail. Then he got rid of email. Now,
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:54.240]   it's all tweets. All tweets all the way down. Tiktok him, Leo. Tiktok him. And we love you,
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.920]   Rosemary Orchard. It's always a pleasure to have you on the show. I hope you will make your way back
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:04.800]   here again very soon. Rosemary Orchard.com. You do podcasts, anything you want to plug?
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.880]   Oh, well, I've been working on a fun show for Screencast Online, which should be out early in
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:17.360]   the New Year. So yeah, keep an eye on that. Oh, fun. Yeah. Please give my regards to Don.
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:22.240]   I will do. Yeah. I didn't realize. I guess I did realize you're doing stuff with him. Yeah,
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:27.200]   that's great. You both sound the same. You both have that weird accent. Thank God.
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:32.640]   I sound much more American than I do British. You do. You do. He has quite a
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:37.200]   viscos kind of thing going on. I don't know what he's a liver puddly. And yeah.
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:40.960]   So great to have you, Rosemary. Come back again soon. And
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:48.240]   we'll see you soon, I think. A reminder that next week we will be doing the best of on Mac
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.640]   Break Weekly the following week. We'll be back with a look back at the year and a look ahead into
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:18:00.160]   2021. We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, right after iOS today. And because iOS today can go
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:06.240]   long, sometime between 11 and noon Pacific time, that's 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:12.320]   It's roughly 2100 UTC if you want to watch live. There's a live audio and video stream at
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:19.760]   twit.tv/live. And if you're watching live, chat with us. I R C dot twit.tv. On-demand versions of
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:26.480]   every show we do are available at our website, twit.tv. In this case, twit.tv/mbw for Mac Break
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:30.720]   Weekly. There's a Mac Break Weekly YouTube channel where all the shows appear in video.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.240]   Best thing though, if you would subscribe to our podcast and your favorite podcast application,
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.440]   that way you'll get it automatically. It's no charge. It's just automatic and you get it the
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:46.960]   minutes available of a Tuesday afternoon. Thanks everybody. We'll see you in a bit. Have a happy
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:54.320]   holiday. Whatever winter solstice you celebrate. I hope you celebrate it with joy and health.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:00.080]   We will see you before the new year. But now it's time to get back to work because
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:05.680]   Break time is over. Bye bye. Want more twit? Well, you got to check out iOS today. It's the
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:12.800]   show where Leo Laport and I talk about everything to do with iOS, iPad, OS, tv OS, watch OS. It's all
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:19.280]   the devices, all the best apps, games and services, everything in between plus a whole lot of laughter.
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:29.280]   Twit.tv/ios for iOS today.
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:34.800]   [Music]
