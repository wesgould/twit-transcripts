[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.080]   We'll talk about Apple's quarterly results last week, some big court results in Europe.

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760]   That's all I have to say.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.720]   There's news.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   Came out at 6 in the morning, art time, but there's news.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.320]   That's the friendly, friendly, turtle of your good buddy Andy Inako of WGBH Boston High Andrew.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.760]   Hello.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.040]   Yeah, it's always fun.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   Like when the first things I do in the morning is read my daily comic strips on Go Comics.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.360]   And then I also just like see, is there anything really awesome in my YouTube feed
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.520]   that I don't want to start the day before I watch?
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   And so it's always nice before, oh, I'm going to have to take a look at that before later.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.240]   So when the video starts posting, okay, good thing I didn't decide to go for a walk or anything.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.320]   Life is strange that way.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.000]   All of a sudden, Apple's on the East Coast.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.400]   I don't know.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.320]   Who's working in PR at 6 a.m.?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.800]   I don't know.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.840]   Somebody pushed the ball.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.520]   It's all about Madison Avenue, baby.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.200]   You know, it probably is.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.360]   Right?
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   It's all about stock.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.400]   Alex Lindsey, I'm sure when the news came in, was busy, busy, busy,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.160]   because he's going to be one of the people's going to be using Final Cut on an iPad.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.680]   I betcha, betcha, betcha.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.160]   Hi, Alex.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.040]   We were on Office Hours.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.840]   Hey, hey, we were on Office Hours and someone asked the question.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.720]   I was like, they're what?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.120]   They're what?
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.960]   I didn't get to see it because usually we're in a pre-show and weren't really paying attention
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.600]   to that by then.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.680]   And I was happily surprised.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.160]   That's good.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   I make a habit of going to the Apple newsroom right before the show, just in case.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.920]   I'm usually disappointing, not this time.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.480]   And as we knew, Jason Snell has taken the week off visit mom, it's Mother's Day weekend,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.040]   coming up.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.360]   He's a good son.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.440]   So instead of the six-colored charts today, we're going to have the Apple Insider charts today.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.480]   It was Steven Robles.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.360]   Hello, Steven.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.640]   Good.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.280]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   I even have a Final Cut right here on my iPhone already.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.560]   No, you don't.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.360]   You stop that.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.720]   You can't.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.520]   Not allowed.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.040]   Not allowed.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   It's coming out May so the new, I should say the news, which we haven't said yet.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.160]   Apple is bringing Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to the iPad.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.800]   You will have to buy it anew.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.680]   In fact, it's a subscription, which means five bucks a month for each Amir $60 a year.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.720]   I think that's a good deal.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.360]   Frankly, Apple has had the best deal ever.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.520]   I bought Logic years ago, Final Cut Pro years ago.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.120]   Never gave him another cent for $2.99 or whatever it was.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.640]   So I don't mind.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.720]   I think five bucks a month is a fair price.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.520]   You will have to have an M1 or later iPad to use Final Cut Pro.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.920]   You will have to have a 12 or later to use Logic.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.360]   It's not out yet.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.920]   Despite what Steven's showing us, it won't be out until May 23.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.840]   Is that a real copy you've got there, Steven?
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.120]   No, no.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.080]   Last week, a basic Apple guy on Twitter, he's a great follow,
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.440]   but he created a Final Cut iOS icon just for fun.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880]   Maybe he's got some inside knowledge, but that's not what we want.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.520]   He might.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.760]   Now, we should say it will not run on an iPhone.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.560]   So.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.880]   Right.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.320]   I knew immediately.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.480]   And for good reason, look at the UI.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.280]   This is Logic.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.080]   I'll fit on a six inch screen.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   That's for sure.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.840]   But what a perfect way, because now we are the multiple generation of,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   we have to freeze frame whatever we're watching, no matter what it is,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.240]   to look for Easter eggs and other conclusions.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.960]   There is no better troll than to simply put an icon somewhere in the back of the screen.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.720]   So the people, oh my God, I forgot to clear his desktop before an Apple's into that.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.280]   Didn't they?
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.400]   There was a final event.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.480]   Wasn't there a Final Cut Pro on an iPad?
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.160]   I feel like there was.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.200]   It showed up the venture resolve on the iPad.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.800]   They did announce the venture resolve.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.960]   Before resolve was announced.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.120]   So Apple talked about the venture resolve on the iPad before.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.520]   Okay.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.040]   Resolve was announced on its own.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.840]   Now, we know WWDC is June 5th.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.360]   So there is a larger story, which is, well, why did Apple do this now?
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.320]   It would have been a big WWDC level announcement, I think.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.960]   We've been talking for a long time about, you know, this is Jason Snell's refrain.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.240]   You made this amazing hardware and you don't put professional software on it.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   It's what a waste.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.480]   I think that's one of the big problems that Apple has is that there's no real reason to
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   upgrade your iPad very often because most of the apps run perfectly fine.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.320]   My kids have the first iPad Pro 12.9 and they're still using them just fine.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.520]   They don't ever feel like they can't do what they're trying to do on it.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.320]   And I didn't really feel the stretch until I put resolve on my iPad.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.480]   Whereas like, oh, maybe I need to get the M2.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   You know, because I still have with the M1, I felt like it was doing pretty well.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.520]   And so I think that Apple, you know, I think we want to see more of these professional ads
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.360]   because the iPad is capable of it.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.160]   It's just that we're not seeing the apps, you know, that take advantage of it.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.440]   So I think it's a really interesting thing.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.600]   I think that the membership had to happen.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.720]   I have Apple spend so much time talking to developers about using subscription services
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.320]   that if they had put it out as a single item, it would have undermined their entire, you know,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.640]   thread that they have about how you should run an app.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.320]   I do think it's telling though, because last year they had the iPad OS announcement.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.520]   Desktop class apps was like a highlighted headline there.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.280]   Then they talk about free form.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.320]   And so I do feel like Final Cut definitely could have had a huge moment at WWDC this year.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.880]   But I think it's because they're making room for big announcement.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.600]   I mean, the rumors about the VR headset are kind of all over the place.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.040]   So maybe it's to make room for that and all the big enough.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.880]   Yeah, I agree with that completely.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.640]   Apple, Apple isn't like Google.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.280]   Google will, Google will expand the length of their, like their developer keynote to include
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.600]   anything that they think that they want to put in there.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.480]   Which by the way, we're going to find out tomorrow because it's tomorrow.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.920]   We're going to push, we started 10am.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.040]   I have a feeling we'll be pushing Windows weekly in this week in Google.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.800]   Down the road.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.960]   Because not to turn this into a Google podcast, but like,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.600]   whereas Apple has a lot of, Apple has just a lot of simple linear things to talk about.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.880]   And hey, you know what?
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.280]   We don't really have to, this is a developer keynote.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.160]   We don't really have to talk about, we don't really announce Final Cut and new
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.480]   audio logic apps for the iPad right here.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   Whereas especially this year, Google says, shareholders, please don't take our stock,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.080]   just because we don't have a chat bot.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.840]   And also bored, please don't fire me a CEO.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.560]   I'm doing it ever so hard a job right now.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   So yeah, it's going to be, you nailed it.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.120]   It's going to be the Sundar Pachai apology tour tomorrow.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.920]   We'll see.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.600]   Actually, they're going to talk a lot about AI.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.760]   I know they've got a folding phone, which they finally admit they're going to be making.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.880]   They'll have things to say.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.160]   It is refreshing to talk to, I mean, to bring it to Apple, it is refreshing that I always
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.760]   thought that Apple has a sort of sometimes an infant, infant infitalizing attitude towards
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.880]   its users saying, well, everybody, we hate leaks because we want the delight and surprise
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.960]   our users like, okay, we're not the result.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.040]   And this isn't Christmas Eve.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.280]   It's like, we're as Google, Google is like, sure, we'll show you the folding phone.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.720]   I sure we'll talk about this tablet because we're working on it for about six months.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.600]   That's perfectly fine for me.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.120]   It's very different attitudes, isn't it?
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.560]   I think my read on it was just Apple wants to clear the decks for what will be the most
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   important announcement of WWDC, the VR Visor.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   And there's a big question still around now, this may be why suddenly there wasn't a lot of
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.440]   updates to Final Cut and a lot of people have been talking about.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   We haven't seen any new features for like a year and a half.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.120]   People are starting to go, well, if Apple and we went, just went through NAB where,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.440]   you know, resolve and premiere saw a lot of updates.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.680]   And so a lot of Final Cut users were getting a little antsy or are getting antsy.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.480]   And so I think that this was, I think that this clears the deck.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.320]   But what we don't know is that the only thing that they're going to update.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:45.040]   So there's a lot of tools that Apple has added to Final Cut in motion that would make it very
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.280]   useful for the delivery of content for AR and VR headsets.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   And so the question is, is the delay that we're seeing related to them putting a bunch of new
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.200]   features in that they can't talk about?
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.560]   And the team has essentially stopped working on everything else for the last year and a half.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.880]   And just working on getting the 3D tools up to speed, getting the VR tools up to speed.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.640]   Those are all in there already to some degree, but they're not very well formed.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.280]   That's a good point.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.840]   You'll be using both Final Cut and Logic to create content for the headset, won't you?
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.440]   Or, and potentially, and Apple's been adding, of course, Logic has been adding lots of
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.000]   immersive audio tools and so on and so forth into it.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.800]   But I think that also that potentially Final Cut and motion become some of the primary tools
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   to drop video level work into an immersive environment.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.280]   And we don't know if that's the truth or not yet, but we will in a couple of weeks.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.400]   And so it's going to be really interesting to see if they roll out and that's why it'll all make
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:51.280]   sense of it. If it doesn't, they're going to have a Final Cut will still do great, but it will be
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:58.160]   it'll need to really focus on the social media environment because I think if they don't update
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.480]   within by October, I think that most professionals will start moving to other things and their market,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.840]   well, in their market, it may be fine for their market to be mostly social media producers and
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.160]   that. That may be where Apple's going and that also is easier when you make it available on the iPad.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.560]   So there's that could be the solution as well. Final Cut Pro for the iPad reading from Apple's
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:26.240]   press release introduces an all new touch interface and intuitive tools unlocking new workflows for
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.640]   video creators. A new jog wheel makes the editing process easier than ever and enables users to
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.400]   interact with content in completely new ways. They can navigate the magnetic timeline movie
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.600]   clips to make fast frame accurate edits with just the tap of a finger or better yet the pencil.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.160]   If you have a little feature, I think it's really exciting. It's called AutoCrop and it shows some
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.440]   screenshots on the actual Final Cut page. But this is a feature that you see in things like CapCut
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.880]   and other apps that you can get for iPad where it will intelligently crop a full lane 16 by 9
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.080]   clip to a vertical clip for things like reels and tic-tops on the subject. And what's interesting
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:12.480]   is that they buy that from Quibi? Well, it's funny because most companies will call this an AI
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.280]   feature like this is AI powered cropping. And if you look on Apple's landing page for Final Cut,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.440]   they're very careful to not mention the words AI or artificial intelligence anywhere. But for
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.360]   the AutoCrop feature, it says intelligently adjust footage for vertical bear other aspect ratios.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.320]   And so I'm curious as far as farther down the page where you see like the glass blowing
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.240]   handle thing, there's scene removal mask, which is like an auto green screen,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.560]   which again is a takeoff like TikTok. And what they do, AutoCrop and voice isolation,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.000]   those are kind of three features put together. Curious if they will actually say these are like
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.560]   ML machine learning features, AI features, and if they'll bring these to the Final Cut on desktop,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.640]   because this AutoCrop feature, as far as I know, is not in Final Cut for the Mac right now.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.040]   And I'd love to see it. That saved me a ton of fun.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.080]   Yeah, that's really interesting to me too about whether, are they going to decide to make Final Cut
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:09.520]   into a iPad focused edition of Final Cut, meaning that they're going to have a pro level editing suite
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.120]   for people who are likely to be editing on an iPad, or are they going to try to do,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.680]   we're going to try to give you an equivalent experience as much as as humanly and engineering
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   possible between these two platforms. So if you were switched to, so you could start editing a
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.960]   project on Final Cut for desktop, spend some time on the plane, continuing the project on iPad,
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.640]   and then continue back on the original when you come back. That's two different ways to do it.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.920]   And with the M1 chip powering, powering both of your machines, there's a lot of potential there.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.280]   Well, it says on the page, you can send a project to Mac. So if you start in Final Cut on iPad,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.480]   it'll be a Mac, but it does not say you could send it backwards. And I imagine some compatibility
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.800]   issues if you start in Final Cut on a Mac and try to send it to the iPad, I don't think you'll be
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   able to do that. That's too bad. You can't go for full round trip. I mean, one of the real
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.200]   powerful things there, though, is to be able to do an assembly while you're still shooting.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.200]   And so, yeah, that makes me think that's the point, is right, to bring the iPad to the studio.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.960]   Yeah. And so you could be sitting there with an iPad and a director or someone sitting there,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.800]   and they could be doing this on a laptop as well. But an iPad is kind of a nice place to do that,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.680]   where now I don't think the iPad can ingest yet directly, but you could be potentially sending
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.760]   something via NDI or sending something up to Frame.io as camera to cloud and then pointed back to the
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.320]   iPad in the same location, and then being able to assemble things. And you can do that with
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.160]   Resolve as well. And so those are things that I think that being able to make those decisions,
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.000]   the reason that editing, if you have everything storyboarded and you start shooting everything
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.160]   and you start inserting them, a lot of times before you've broken down that set and set
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   let go of the crew that you're spending $25,000 a day on, you can go and shoot a couple inserts.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.760]   I need a couple hands to do this, or I need something else. And so, the closer we get to being able to
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.840]   edit while we're shooting, oftentimes the more we just think of a couple things that would be nice
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   to have for the editor later. And so, so those are the fancy video tap with a little more control.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.240]   Tell me, just for those of us who are not pros like you, you can't ingest. What does that mean?
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:16.080]   It just means that right now there's no way that I know of that you can plug in some kind of card
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:22.400]   that would let you take the HDMI or SDI feed from the camera and capture it directly to the iPad.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.120]   And so, I don't think that it should be capable. So, where would you ingest?
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.760]   It was you said if you have a NDI connection, you can watch it live, but how it otherwise,
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.360]   what are you going to do? Have a computer there and ingest it? Again, you'd save it to files.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.480]   You either save it to files, the cloud files, or you could do something I imagine you could
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.200]   tie it into something like Frame.io. So, Frame.io, you can have a camera to cloud, which is you have
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.920]   a taredec or something connected to your camera and it's uploading while you're shooting. Every
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.560]   time you hit stop, it just uploads that file to Frame and then people can pull it immediately down.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.760]   And so, those are ways to kind of get it in there really quickly.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:05.440]   This is the beginning probably because, again, the USB-C is capable of getting video in. We have
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:13.040]   other USB devices that will capture video. The M1 and M2 are definitely capable of managing that
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.080]   process. What's missing is the subsystems that would allow that to easily flow straight to files,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:24.000]   you know, onto the on there. And so, that's, but it feels like one of the reasons probably
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.760]   they're requiring these higher end iPads is you can hook up a Thunderbolt drive to the iPad and use it
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:36.560]   as, well, right? As your big... It's not clear from the information they've given whether you can
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.080]   edit off an SSD. That's something where LumaFusion on iPad, you can actually have the footage on an
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.440]   external SSD drive connected to an iPad with a Thunderbolt cable and actually edit with the footage
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.720]   sitting on the drive. Nowhere on this Final Cut landing page, does it say you can keep footage on
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.960]   an external drive and edit it in real cut. So, you might have to actually transfer it onto the iPad
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.320]   directly before you can edit it. But it's unclear. They didn't say anything about it.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:09.760]   That's a big deal because you... I mean, they do make two terabyte iPads now, but still.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.680]   And I think if we think about really large projects, we're probably going to go back to desktop,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.600]   but where I think this really fits in is for social media. So, if you're... I'm going to go to
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.360]   Cinegir in a couple of weeks and we're going to shoot a bunch of stuff. I'm definitely going to
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   take an iPad down and I'm just going to try shooting... I've done this with LumaFusion in the past,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   which is that if I want to shoot it short, I'm just going to try to shoot it probably with
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.840]   LumaFusion and with Final Cut just to see what it feels like. But I could theoretically just be
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.000]   shooting everything with the iPad, have a nice little rig. You can get these small rig or
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.840]   a couple different... Use the iPad's camera? Yeah, use the iPad's camera for social media.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.640]   Absolutely. I mean, I have one of these USB-C dongles with an SD card slot on one side.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.280]   And so, I would bring my Sony A74 mirror. Just pop it. Just pop the footage,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.440]   put it on the iPad and then edit it in Final Cut. Whether you have to copy or not,
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.840]   we'll make a difference, of course, to you. I guess you wouldn't want to edit on an SD card
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.040]   anyway. You would copy it to the iPad. And I think that, again, when you're talking about
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.760]   wanting to turn things over really fast, I look at shorts. One thing I'm interested in is,
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.360]   do the plug-in architecture that works in motion, will it go over to work in Final Cut? Can I,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.920]   for instance, save a bunch of effects that I build in motion that might be my lower thirds,
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.400]   might be my text-ups and so on and so forth that are all designed the way I want them,
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.480]   and I just have to type them in. That would be an incredible integration. But I don't know
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.680]   whether those will be supported, at least in the first version of iPad.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.280]   So lots of questions raised by this Apple announcement, obviously.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.240]   Go ahead.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.640]   Well, one of the words on external devices, on the page under the monitoring settings,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.960]   it talks about capturing progress footage on iPad, but you'll also be able to monitor external
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.920]   microphones connected to the iPad. And this is a big deal because I deal with a lot of microphone
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   and podcasting and iOS devices. And it's largely like a black box. Like, you usually are not sure
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.040]   if it's using the external microphone. You don't really get audio levels from the external microphone.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   And so here, it looks like they're making an effort to encourage external mics,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.600]   show you that monitoring live on the iPad screen. And so I feel like maybe a year or two from now,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.040]   we might be close to that kind of ingest of video footage, whether it's an external mirrorless
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.760]   camera connected via a cable or a webcam. And I do hear from a lot of people that wish they
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.080]   could connect things like external cameras to an iPad for a video podcast or whatever.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.360]   Yeah, I think that's one of the few things that defines the difference between,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.440]   I'm going to New York for two or three days, I can just take my iPad and I'm going to New
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.840]   York for two or three days, but I have to do one 15 minute, pretty okay quality video stream.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.720]   Therefore, I have to bring the notebook plus a plus everything that I need to
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   exercise, exercise with it. Yeah, that's one thing that they do.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.000]   They're showing some tick tockers, shoot with the iPad at the skate park, then go to the diner
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.800]   and edit at the diner and everything they need and post from the iPad, I presume, right? Just
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.440]   put it right up there. Yeah, and I think that we're seeing Apple Apple's been doing this for a
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.280]   couple of years as they're focusing more and more on social media content creators.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.400]   Yeah. They've been very successful in that area. So a lot of content creators are because that's
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   fast and see, when you're not getting paid per hour, you want to be able to throw it together as
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.680]   quickly as possible. And so a lot of creators use Final Cut right now. And so I think it seems
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.120]   like they're looking at a market that has really embraced them as opposed to the film market,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:43.440]   which has been just not super excited about Final Cut. And so I think that they may end up
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   not leaving, but definitely focusing more energy on the social platforms.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.360]   Yeah, but that's a huge and growing platform. It's bigger. It's far bigger than the broadcast
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.680]   market is getting smaller. Social media is getting bigger. It's probably not. And the problem is that
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.080]   in social media, a lot of people that every new feature is something that they're pretty excited
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:12.400]   about. And when they want it, a lot of people want it. In film and TV, it's a lot of really
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.000]   fiddly things that people want that take an enormous amount of engineering and the chances of
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   them actually using Apple's product is very low because they'll complain about something that they
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.400]   want that they have an avid or premier resolve. But the chances of them actually changing course
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.320]   for that feature is very low. So the ROI for Apple to chase after the film and TV market is very
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.480]   very hard case to make. Whereas in social media, there's no real clear winner. There's an Apple,
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   I think Final Cut is probably one of the largest installed devices for that kind of thing.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.400]   But it's a market that is still ripe for a lot of disruption.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   I think the pricing also tells you that's where they're headed because if it's a pro market,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:05.600]   you could charge a heck of a lot more, $4.99 a month, get one month free, or you could pay $50
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.840]   for an entire year. And that's for each product. So if you wanted both, and I guess there people
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.880]   would want both, that'd be $100 a year. That's well within any social media creators budget.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.160]   That makes sense, right? I'm curious if it will be available for iCloud family sharing also.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:32.400]   My kids, because they're inexpensive labor, I've actually have them taking my video podcast
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.360]   content and making vertical clips so I can post a TikTok in real.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.720]   Oh, why did I take that?
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.760]   Yeah. Thank you. They don't have a Mac. And I actually don't have a family Mac around set up.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.760]   They have iPads. And actually to change 16 by 9 video to a vertical clip on an iPad,
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.440]   you can't do it in iMovie. It just doesn't have that kind of feature. So that autocrop and Final Cut
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.280]   is going to be the deal. And so I'm going to get them Final Cut. Unfortunately, they have older
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.600]   iPads. So don't tell them I might have to get them. You can use it on an air though, right?
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:12.080]   And you'll want the M1 Air, M2 Air, and you'll want the pencil, I imagine, or no, Alex. Is this
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.400]   the kind of thing you have? I think I bet you there's a lot of opportunities for innovation
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.280]   with the pencil as it relates to Final Cut. I think they saw in some of the examples they showed
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.240]   some places where you could paint on it and so on and so forth. If you look at how, even how
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:32.320]   it's being used in Keynote, there are features in the iPad version of Keynote that aren't available
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.800]   on the desktop. So I can grab onto an object, for instance, with my pencil on Keynote and just
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.920]   animate it. Just swing around. I want it to go over here, then I want it to go over here,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.200]   then I want it to go over here. And I let go and that animation's there now.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   Yeah, watching this clip from the film that they put out, they've got a creator using a pencil
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:01.920]   in Logic, but then drawing a sound. Yeah, there's all sorts of possibilities, aren't there?
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.960]   Yeah. And of course, those guys in the diner, as was earlier creator, are annotating
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.040]   and putting text because that's what creators do. They like to do, they put text on their video
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.840]   with a pencil. I think if you just think about just circling, doing something where you're just
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.280]   circling something and doing arrow over here, even for not just for creators, but for teachers.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.320]   A lot of things, there could be potentially an enormous number of opportunities here that
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:36.720]   you wouldn't have in a traditional NLE. So I think it's a really interesting opportunity.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:45.360]   Let me quote the movie, "My friends are really going to be gassed. If somebody gets nasty with
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.240]   this, they're going to become really good." I don't know what the kids are talking about,
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.840]   but obviously, Apple, they seem very excited. They seem rather impressed.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.720]   Getting nasty with it and gassed. Okay, fine.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.560]   It's exciting that Apple also said third-party content will be available in Final
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.320]   and Final and iPad. So Motion VFX, FX Factory Pro, I use a ton of Motion VFX plugins.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.200]   And so the fact that you can use those kind of lower thirds in animations,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.960]   which is big for those shorts and vertical videos also, it's pretty exciting.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.840]   Well, and if you start loading this, even just the free samples Apple provides on Logic,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.680]   you're going to be many, many gigabytes of storage. You're probably going to want to
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.760]   dedicate an iPad to these tools. I just want to see if they add some kind of emoji function
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.040]   where you can just immediately put in your little emoji heads right into Final Cut and you build
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.800]   your own. Oh, you know you're going to be able to do that. They actually showed in the video,
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:49.200]   they showed the press and hold to turn into a sticker in Final Cut and then the moving that
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.640]   sticker onto a title card. Is that that? I don't think Final Cut has that right now, does it?
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.880]   You could do it in messages. You could do it in messages and then it's in your photos and then
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.520]   you can export it from photos and Final Cut. So the text there, it doesn't matter adding that
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.440]   little piece to the stack. So it probably wasn't that hard. This is I think this is very exciting
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   news. I think worthy of the announcement at WWDC, which makes me even more excited about what they
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   might announce next month at WWDC. Yeah. I wonder it's going to be interesting to see,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:32.400]   as has been mentioned, the use of external lightning devices would be super interesting.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.760]   I wonder if this is a good time to do a head-to-head between. Is it slower to ingest and to edit stuff
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:44.720]   off in just and edit stuff across lightning as then it is to use unified memory?
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.080]   Because that's always been one of the selling points of at least on the desktop.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   Here's why we can't let you upgrade stuff on your own because we have this brand new memory model
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.560]   that's 10 times better than anything you would like if you were able to just buy an $80 drive
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.440]   and put it in yourself. Do you think this also means that Apple will announce iPads? I mean,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.240]   this would be a prime opportunity to say, "Hey, here's the iPad made for Final Cut and Logic."
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:18.720]   The M2 is way more powerful than the iPad. They don't have an M2 iPad Air yet. So they might
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:27.200]   just say we put the M2 and the iPad Air and call it a day. I think that most of what this is is
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.480]   they've got a lot of things to it. Yeah, I agree. And they need to clear the deck a little bit,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.720]   as Andy said, and they just need to have a... They're very... Fortunately for all of us,
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:45.760]   they're fairly disciplined about how long these keynotes go. And so I think that they're trying
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:52.720]   to get it down probably to 80 or 90 minutes. I think they wanted lower than that. I think they
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:59.120]   had a couple of been at 80, 90 minutes. Have they not a type... Oh, WWDCs. They were tight 60s for a while.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.640]   And I just know because I have to oftentimes we're doing stuff for office hours and we get to the
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:12.880]   top of the next hour and I'm like, "Oh, gotta go." So maxed out with two terabytes of storage,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:23.520]   the current pro with an M2 is $2,400. So that's PC price. It's not like...
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.800]   You know, I mean, that's a premium PC price. That's buying a MacBook Pro.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.600]   Yeah, it'll be a bummer if you spend all that money for it and you realize that,
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.080]   "Oh, this one part of my workflow that's super important for me on my Mac is not present in this
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.400]   iPad." I do think if it made you feel like better, you can buy a Mac. Right now, you can buy a Mac
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.760]   studio at... I was in Costco buying something and I walked by... I was buying some work on
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.680]   Carkels. I walked by the Mac studio and it's $1,499 for a Mac studio.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:01.520]   That's what I run it. I have the Mac studio just the M1 Macs version, but it's incredible.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.680]   I love it. I have the Mac version. I have the Mac. That's what I'm on right now and it was very...
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.480]   I don't have... I was like, "I can't spend that money." But my pockets are smoldering,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.840]   just walking by. So it does make you wonder when you see $500 discounts at Costco,
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   you wonder what's going to happen at Dub Dub. It feels like they're trying to clear product.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.240]   Usually when you see these sales, it gets to go. I'm getting excited about that.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.920]   Yeah. Because I was not excited about the VR headset, be honest with you.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.040]   Right. If they announce new Macs, new iPads, Mac Pro.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.960]   15-inch MacBook Air, probably.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:42.720]   We don't know anything. We think, "German knows." We just follow in his wake.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.880]   And again, I would say that if I was going to release another Mac studio or a Mac Pro,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:55.600]   what I would do is sell as many at Costco as possible. In the couple of weeks before now,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.280]   like clear it, clear that deck because it'll be really hard to move them after that.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.760]   We had to see the Mac Pro, right? The Mac Pro's got to be coming. I mean...
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.440]   Somewhere out there. They said it's coming. They said it's coming two years ago.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:13.040]   They said it was coming up year. They're already late, so it's not as though releasing it to
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.640]   WDC will make it unlight. Now the pressure is awfully enough.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.400]   But I will say that the last time they announced the new Mac Pro was the ED-Dub-Dub.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.840]   Yeah. That's where you would... That's where the pros are.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.920]   Where the pros are. That's when it's shallow. Frankie Valley. Frankie...
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.120]   It wasn't Frankie Valley. It was the other Frankie.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.320]   It was five years ago now that I think about it. I think it was 2018 when they did the
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.400]   new Mac Pro. The new cheese grater was, I think... 2019.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.320]   I think this has rekindled my hope for Aputure. Can Aputure...
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.480]   No, I think they should kill your hope for Aputure. But there is one more pro-product missing
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:58.640]   from an iPad that could mean that it could be your full-time computing device, and that would be
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:06.000]   Xcode, right? We always said that if they put Final Cut on there and Xcode on there,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.440]   then you don't need to desktop anymore. But I wouldn't want to code on an iPad.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   It would nice to be that alternative, though, and especially for... Given that the iPad isn't
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:26.000]   just Apple's tablet, it's also their budget computer. And so the ability for people who are
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.080]   getting on board the Apple ecosystem for well under $1,000 as low as $300 to be able to develop
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.800]   and deploy actual App Store apps on the thing, that would be a game checker.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.200]   I thought by now they would advance their Swift
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.280]   playgrounds to the point where you could do... I guess you can put it on the App Store,
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:54.640]   but that would be a point, whatever you call it, drag and drop programming kind of thing,
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:01.760]   where some typing, whizziwig, and playgrounds is kind of slowly, much more slowly than I would
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.040]   have expected moving in that direction. Maybe that's what we're waiting for, not Xcode,
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.800]   but just playgrounds to become more powerful.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   Do we think they're going to move the desktop Final Cut to a subscription model after this?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.040]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   I think that they're just happy that everyone's still... I don't think that they're going to
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.120]   change it. I think that that would be hard because a lot of us have used that as a reason that we
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.840]   stuck around for a long time. It's like, well, you don't pay any subscription for it and
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.400]   everything out. People were pissed, by the way. I saw a number of people in the usual
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:43.040]   snark zones, Twitter and Reddit and Hacker News, that there was, "Oh, Apple's doing an Adobe."
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.600]   Wow, it's a lot less money. It's $5 a month and $50 a month is two very different numbers
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.640]   for what's going on. To be fair, $10 is cheapest $10 if you just want one
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.960]   to put on the product. Which is one of the crown jewels.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.840]   Minimum. They don't let you take each one of those. So Photoshop, you get $10 a month.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.760]   But if you want After Effects or Premiere, you got to buy into the entire suite.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:14.880]   That's the thing that has a lot of reason that folks like me won't use Premiere is because I'm
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.760]   like, I don't need all of those apps and I don't want to pay for all those apps.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.640]   I get the business model, but I don't appreciate it.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.440]   On the flip side of that, A, if it keeps you completely up to date on new revisions as they
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.520]   come out, that's a nice thing. That's one of the benefits of Adobe. I think that they did follow
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.120]   through on their promise to say that, "Look, it's not as though we're just going to give you an
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.480]   option on an alternative towards never giving us any more money ever again." They do keep enhancing
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:49.600]   it with really, really nice barn door style updates. But the other cool thing is that it really does
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.440]   lower the bar for a lot of makers that people can figure out that they can afford $5 a month or even.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.960]   I've got this one project that's going to take me three months. I'll invest $15 in a three-month
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.600]   subscription to Final Cut Pro, but they may not be in an economic position where they can say,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   "I need Final Cut Pro, but I just absolutely cannot afford it right now."
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.360]   Yeah, I think, and again, I wouldn't have as much of a problem with the dough. I paid
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.560]   $10 a month for Photoshop. You know, like... That's Photoshop Lightroom.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   And that's fine. Bundle is worth $10 a month, yeah.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.080]   But it's the... That's twice what this is.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:31.360]   It's the... You have to pay for everything else if you want, just because all I want is After Effects
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.200]   and potentially Premiere. I don't want all the other apps. I don't need them.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.640]   You know, like it's quite annoying. It's quite annoying.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.960]   It's quite annoying. I just feel like there's a point... And then they push storage,
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.160]   expensive storage on you. And again, for me, there's a point of subscription makes sense.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.000]   The developer gets money on, go on going, Lee. They can... That allows them to innovate.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.320]   I get that. It's the... I'm going to bundle you into something that makes it...
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.400]   The pre ensures that I make way more money.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.680]   Yeah. It's a manipulative behavior that I don't... That I just think Adobe...
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:06.080]   I'm sure that they're making a lot of money, but it's really... They're creating this huge gap
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.000]   because there's a lot of people upset about it. It's a difference between an ongoing income and
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.680]   rent seeking. And Adobe's absolutely rent seeking at this point.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.280]   And the thing is that... And that's why a lot of people, like as... The other problem that Adobe
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.640]   has is that there are three times as many engineers working on Resolve as there are on After Effects
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.760]   and Premiere. And so as Resolve keeps on getting better and better and better, people are...
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.600]   Like for me, I'm half and half Final Cut and Resolve. So when I do precision work,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.960]   I use Resolve. When I use Fast and Furious, I use Final Cut. And it's about half of my editing
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.440]   time is spent in one of the other. And I don't need them to change. I'm not trying to figure out
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.840]   which one's going to win. I just use the two and I know what... I want to go into a project.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.760]   I know which one I'm going to use. And I don't try to figure out how to get back and forth between
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:58.720]   them or anything else. I just do the thing. And so I think that I don't really feel that pressure,
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.840]   but I will say that I know a lot of people that are using Premiere that are looking at Resolve
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:13.040]   as a $300 buy once, never even pay for an upgrade. Like, why am I here? And it wasn't that way a
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.520]   couple years ago, but it's starting to start to really edge people out. And it's because they're
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.640]   only using Premiere and being forced to pay for everything. And that's the thing that is really
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.000]   driving people crazy. I've been feeling, as I said at the beginning, guilty that I paid once five
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.400]   or six or seven years ago for Logic and Final Cut. I don't feel guilty at all.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.240]   Well, I want to... Yeah, I mean, Apple doesn't need the support, but I don't think it's a problem
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   saying five bucks a month or $49. I think that's appropriate. I do think really there's an
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.520]   interesting story here. I think you nailed it, Alex, that Apple is pivoting to creators
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:58.240]   or social media style creators, Tiktakers and YouTubers, as opposed to movie studios and TV
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.000]   and I think it totally makes sense. And it makes it a lot of sense. That's the right way to go.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.360]   That's absolutely the right way to go. And by the way, that's the most vital,
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.880]   interesting area right now in production, right? Yeah. Well, with the writer strike,
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:16.480]   absolutely. Yeah, timing is excellent by Apple. Yeah, the timing couldn't be any better. There's
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.320]   a whole lot of people that are just going to sit there and wait for the next thing while the
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   creators go crazy. Another thing somebody in our Discord pointed out, in none of these videos
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.560]   or stills, do you see stage manager? Oh, good. Good catch.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.360]   I still don't get that. Isn't that interesting, right?
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.840]   You want to take up so much space, you want that full screen, you want to re-inship it?
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.520]   No, I don't turn it off too. Yeah. I don't use stage manager.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.400]   Flopola.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.560]   Some things catch up. Apple can put some stuff out and it goes a little slow for a little while.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.040]   Freeform is not something I'm using every day, but I feel like, oh, I could see using this.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.040]   It's cool. I just can't find other people playing. So they're all like, yeah.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.680]   So that's the only problem. In my case, it wasn't so much that I tried it and rejected it.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.880]   It's more like I tried it. I saw that, wow, there's something interesting here,
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.800]   but it is not so intuitive that I can pick it up as I go. I'm going to have to find,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.440]   I'm going to have to wait. It's like binge watching a show that everybody tells you is awesome.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:23.200]   It's like, I'm not rejecting a better call, Saul. I'm saying that I have to defer starting to
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.680]   watch it until I feel as though I have enough time in my schedule to start adapting to this.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   Just getting back to you. I think that you are right about not pivoting towards creators,
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.160]   but making sure the creators are really, really happy. It does click in with something that happened.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.560]   We're going to be talking about the earnings call later on, but one of the most interesting
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.000]   things in the Q&A was Tim Cook was asked directly, say, hey, what about the pro level of the market?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.560]   How's the pro level of market doing? Indeed. Oh, yes, we're absolutely committed to the pro market,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.440]   but he did say outright that we do consider, do I have the quote here? We consider ourselves a
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:03.120]   consumer oriented company. It's not as though they're ever going to abandon pros, but when they
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:08.400]   see where is our bread buttered, it's basically on people walking into a store with their grubby
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.240]   hands full of cash, pulling it down, and then walking out with something they're going to adore,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.720]   as opposed to the machine Smith, so to speak. I will say as a pro, the Mac Mini and the studio,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.840]   but the Mac Mini especially has fulfilled more needs than I've had. It was always like, oh,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.040]   this is a great little package. If it was just a little bit more powerful, and now it's more powerful.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:35.200]   I think that between myself and on I know, I think we've now bought 30 of them. It's not a
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.560]   minor amount of them, and they're great as glue, and you put them in, you go, oh, my son
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.960]   needed to do some programming at school. He just gave them Mac Mini. He's got monitors there,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:53.520]   just plug them in. It's so powerful. I don't think that the demand for the pros is high enough.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.320]   When they show, and this is the percentage, they won't cut it out, but if they split out,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.880]   this is how much we made with a Mac Pro. It'll be like, oh, yeah, I need a little sliver that
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.600]   barely exists. That's probably also why there's not a lot of pressure. I do think it's important,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:14.160]   though, from a mind-share perspective for people to feel like there's a value to having an F1 team.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   There's a value in the development of all the technologies, as well as just where you position
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.040]   the product. I think having a Mac Pro does make a difference in the long term. I think
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.920]   exactly when it comes out and the actual income doesn't matter.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.880]   What's happened is the definition of cool kids has changed, because it used to be people would
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.200]   look to the pros as, oh, they're the cool kids. They're the ones who really use technology.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.480]   We're going to emulate them. Now, I really think the cool kids are the people who own
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:48.960]   Mac Apple stuff and are creating with it. It's not the studios. Those aren't the cool kids anymore.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.640]   I think Apple's completely justified and it's certainly a good economic decision to just say,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:02.560]   look, cool kids use Apple. The thing is, again, most of the pro line is mostly focused on how do
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.360]   you make it more like Apple? That's the request that I can write. That's not a market.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.040]   This is what we want to be more like the product that we're probably just going to stick with anyway,
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.880]   whereas the social media market is really creating new things, new ideas, new ways of cutting.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:25.200]   It's vibrant and fleeting. It's really hard. I think that what people don't realize is how
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:30.800]   hard it is to cut the kind of stuff that we see. It seems like an easy thing when
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.480]   Steve didn't put up something this morning about Final Cut. I was like, wow, that's moving fast.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:45.600]   The thing is that that kind of editing is really hard, especially when you're at a...
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:52.560]   I work with a lot of creators and that kind of work is an enormous amount of very fine-tuned
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.200]   edits and graphics and they're paying attention to things that broadcasters aren't paying attention
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.640]   to and how they put all the stuff up together and it's much faster editing oftentimes.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:08.160]   They need somebody to pay a lot of attention to them. It resolved may do some of that.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.000]   Premiere probably less because they have Rush, which no one uses.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.880]   Adobe's got a Rush team that no one's using. I've never seen Rush in the wild.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.280]   Yeah, I know. That's what Adobe wanted everybody to use.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.440]   It's got a product that they think that everyone's going to use.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:28.720]   I think that for creators, having Apple and Blackmagic sitting there kind of vying for their
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.760]   attention, which I think is really great for them and we're going to see a lot of innovation
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.840]   in what video looks like as you move forward. It's also really...
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.760]   Just quickly, it's also really good for Apple's business because Apple isn't really about,
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.600]   "Hey, we're going to sell a whole bunch of people, a bunch of $10,000 computers and we're going to
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.240]   be really, really happy about those margins." It really is about we are acquiring a customer and
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.480]   then as soon as we get a customer, we can monetize the hell out of them. The person who bought the...
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:04.880]   Instead, if we can get that creator to buy an iPad instead of the $1,500 Windows laptop that
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.600]   they've... In gaming laptop, they thought they were going to. It's not just that $1,500 iPad.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.880]   They're probably going to get a watch. They're probably going to get AirPods. They're probably
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:18.240]   going to subscribe to Apple Services and now they've got revenue for life. That's not necessarily
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.880]   something that someone who has the $10,000 to spend on the Tricked Out Mac Pro, they're just looking
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.680]   for return on investment, bang for the buck, tick off the features that I want. They're not
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.400]   necessarily learning. They're not assessing, setting into emotion a sequence of events that
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:38.000]   leads to them getting an Apple-themed tattoo in seven years. Apple wants to be hip. Apple does
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.440]   not want to be establishment. They are establishment. That's the dirty little secret but they don't
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:48.000]   want to be seen that way. They want to be seen as a punk with the leather jacket, the turn up
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.680]   collar going, "Hey, wait a minute. That's not hip anymore either." But also in order to be that
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.480]   relevant and especially with the influencer TikTok crowd, they're going to have to move very fast
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:05.040]   because as I scroll TikTok as you do, I see the little cap cut logo on so many of the trending
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:10.800]   videos because cap cut will add these templates and filters that will then go viral on TikTok.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.240]   Then everybody wants a video that looks like that. They go to CapCut to make the video.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.400]   In order for Apple to compete and not for people to choose to go to Final Cut on their iPad
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.560]   versus CapCut on their phone, they're going to have to stay with some of those trends or at least
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.520]   offer some of those filters and effects so that people will want to use it.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.600]   You're already out of date. TikTok's dead. TikTok's over. Oh, God, you're looking at TikTok for, man.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:43.760]   I don't know what's in that one. I just know that my kid who was a big TikTok influencer
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.800]   has moved out to Instagram and YouTube and there's no cap cut on his videos. Although,
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.360]   I do notice this is sponsored by Beef. It's what's for dinner.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:45:00.240]   I think he's doing all right. I've heard of that brand. It's sponsored by Beef.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:07.520]   He, by the way, does this with the MacBook Pro 16 and Premiere.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:14.560]   There's no ad for it and nobody's asking him and there's no behind the scenes. Oh, here's how I do it.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.720]   Nobody cares about that. He's a Fogi for heaven's sakes. I know he's 28 now. Oh, my God, he's out of it.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   So old. Here he is. Here he was with somebody even an older Fogi. Smoking a Stogi.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:34.000]   It's Fogies with Stogies. All right, let's take a little break. We do want to talk about the quarterly
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.280]   results even though the six color graphs are not here. They are going to be here in absentia.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:45.040]   There's a lot of other stuff, including the New York Times just noticing that Katie Cotton passed away.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:52.080]   60 days ago or something. Apple Insider, your publication had the story April 10th.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:58.160]   The New York Times published the obituary this week. They probably didn't have that
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.240]   bit ready to roll. I think that's the... Yeah, well, she died very surprisingly in '57.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.640]   It has to be a New York Times obituary. So I wouldn't be surprised if it really did take them a few
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.800]   weeks to get all those quotes. It was a really good big one. It was nice. It was really nice.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.880]   Yeah, Katie Cotton, of course, longtime Apple PR person and really the person who put Apple on
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.600]   the map when Steve Jobs came back. So yeah, she deserves a lot of credit. Passed away at the age
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:29.360]   of 57 in April, but the New York Times obit was this week. Let us move on and we will have more
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:37.280]   in just a bit. I'm going to pop my collar, turn up my thumbs, hey. I talked to you about zip
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.480]   recruiter. If you are starting a business, well, you know, as somebody who runs a small business,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.200]   I really appreciate zip recruiter. Whether you're starting a new business,
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.840]   you're growing a business, or like me, you're just trying to keep that business all the wheels on,
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:58.080]   you need the most talented people on your team. I've really learned a company is just...
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.160]   It's made of people. It's just the people in the company. So when you're hiring,
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.360]   you're building... That's the building blocks. That's the foundation of the company. That's
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:14.240]   where zip recruiter comes in. It really works. You can try it for free right now, zip recruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.880]   If you're going to start a new business, think what it would be. It doesn't matter if it's a charity
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:25.760]   or a taco truck. You still have to hire people for us. When we're under 20 employees and when somebody
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:31.520]   leaves, that's a big gap. That's a whole because suddenly we've got to cover all those responsibilities
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.720]   and at the same time find somebody new. That's why Lisa always goes to zip recruiter. She does it
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.680]   at breakfast. I'm sitting. I'm watching. She's posting it. She chooses a zip recruiter for a number
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:47.040]   of reasons. One, you're posting the largest possible audience. Your post on zip recruiter immediately
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.680]   goes out to 100 other job boards. It goes out to social just automatically. So one click of the
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.080]   mouse in, you're everywhere. Sometimes I know people say, "Well, wait a minute. I don't want
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.120]   millions of phone calls and emails for people who I don't want to hire. Don't worry. It all goes
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.560]   into the zip recruiter interface." They reformat the resumes. They're easy to scan. You can have
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:13.600]   screening questions. This is very powerful. You don't, yes, no multiple choice, even essay questions.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:20.880]   It'll let you kind of filter out and rank the remainder and then pick the right person fast.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.840]   But there's one more thing zip recruiter does that is transformational. Lisa'll post at breakfast.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.760]   Zip recruiter will take that post and go through all their current resumes, more than a million
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:35.920]   resumes using their powerful matching technology and find people whose qualifications match.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.480]   Now they don't invite them to apply. They send them to you. You can look at them,
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:46.400]   same screening process and say, "I want to invite these three. These three really look good."
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.880]   And that makes a huge difference because when somebody is invited to apply for your job,
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.480]   they respond because that's flattering. That's good. So one of the big problems these days in
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:02.240]   hiring is people just know shows on the interviews, not with zip recruiter. Those people are going to
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.200]   apply. And I have to say, with those labels that you could put on here, that's another way
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.160]   zip recruiter really differentiates itself. You can say, "No, you can work remotely, for instance,"
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   or training provided or urgent. We have an urgent need. And those labels are many more will stand out
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.560]   among all the other listings. And that's very powerful. Zip recruiter really works. She'll
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.760]   post it breakfast. And I love it. Within an hour, she's saying, "Oh, look, there's one. Oh, here's
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   another one." And it's such a huge relief because we're desperate. We got to fill this position. And
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:37.920]   by noon, she'll have usually three or four really great candidates. That's how we found Fiva in our
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.040]   continuity department. Let's zip recruiter fill all your roles with the right candidates. Four out of
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.960]   five employers who post on Zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day. For us,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.000]   it was just a matter of a few hours. See for yourself. Right now, you could try it for free.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.080]   Use our special address just for Mac break weekly. And I want you to use this so that they know
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:07.360]   you saw it here. ziprecruiter.com/macbreak. Ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:15.760]   Ziprecruiter, it's the smartest way to hire. And it's exactly how we do it. It really works.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:27.360]   So in a nutshell, Apple's quarter surprisingly good, right? Better than expected anyway. Jason
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:33.600]   Snell last week said, "I predict 90 billion in revenue. It came in higher, not about 94 billion
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:41.920]   in revenue, 94.8 billion." So I guess that's 95. Better than the market expected. The margin,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.280]   better than the market, 44.3%. That's a nice margin. That's very nice profits.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:57.440]   24.16 billion in net income. That's $8 billion a month for three months.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:06.000]   A little bit off the year to year previous. But that's still good money. And the real surprise,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.640]   I should let me pull up the six colors charts because the real surprise was the success of
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.560]   services that has really outperformed for Apple. All-time record. I mentioned that
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:22.320]   it was not just because of one particular segment of it. It was across the App Store,
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:29.200]   Apple Music, iCloud, even Payment Services. Yeah. Because usually the caveat I say is,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.840]   well, it's all through the App Store. And then by the way, that ain't gonna be forever because the
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.560]   EU is really pushing them on that one. Also, in the Q&A, they also did call out that
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:48.800]   App Store game revenue is way, way down largely. And partly that's because they had an artificial
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.840]   booster in COVID, but they're mentioning that advertising revenue is down, game revenue is down.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.720]   And that's probably where you see a lot of the bad news happening.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:03.120]   Service is now nearly a quarter of their revenue. Of course, iPhone still more than half,
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.040]   so even a little more than half the before, 7%, iPad 8%, Mac 9%, wearables.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:18.320]   March quarter record for iPhone. Yeah. This is normally a slow quarter, right?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:28.240]   Yeah. The quarter, first quarter includes holiday sales. And so a lot of the, that takes a lot of
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.720]   the air out of the second quarter reasons for mobiles because whoever was waiting to upgrade,
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.000]   it has probably upgraded by now. So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of really good news here.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:49.840]   If you read the transcript, every single segment either includes the phrase quarter record or it
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:56.480]   says unprecedented foreign exchange, headwinds and unprecedented macro international macro
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:02.160]   economic turndowns. So you know, basically, basically the score of each category there,
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:09.760]   like the Mac was, Mac is down like 31%. Oh, the third phrase is hard to compare because of course,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.880]   this quarter last year, we were getting a big bounce from the release of Apple Silicon. So the
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.920]   fact that Mac, Mac sales are down 31% is hard. It's hard to compare because it's not the same.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   It's like a 15 year old is all excuses, excuses, excuses, excuses. It's valid, but that's the
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.600]   point of an earnings call, right? Basically, even when you have the bad news to try to leaven it as
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:37.360]   best you can without getting sued by shareholders, because you can't say things like that during
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:42.320]   was the worst news. The Mac revenue change, I mean, is bad news for me because I'm a Mac
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:48.560]   user. I love Mac, but year over year, Mac revenue was down 31%. I mean, that's a big drop.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:54.640]   It was it was the most dramatic iPad was down 13%. That's again, also, also M1 changes.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:54:01.440]   Wearables was steady down just 1%. And even then, again, this is where they try to make sure
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.120]   that they got all the good news out. They're saying they had record quarters in the US and
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:11.840]   greater China, despite being down 1%. Services, again, nothing but nice things to say about services.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.400]   And of course, the Mac had after the M1 was released had just an explosion.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:22.800]   It's really hard to keep that pace once you've once you've had such a huge influx.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.680]   In the studio display, all that. Yeah. And what happened? All came out of that in March 2022.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:34.720]   America's down a little bit, China down a touch.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.080]   YMEA Europe in the Middle East up a little bit. Japan kind of flat.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:46.880]   Yeah. I mean, this what else did Tim Cook say? Any other kind of glean? Did you glean any?
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:55.440]   He talked about AI. He said, we're cautious. Yeah. He did. I mean, he did in careful. He was
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:00.720]   asked about that during the Q&A. And he did the usual double edged thing of saying that we're
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:06.320]   cautious. We think that it's still early days, but also kind of like what Sundar Pichai was saying
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:10.720]   in defense of their late arrival into the chat bot saying, Hey, we've been we've been an AI
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.840]   company for a long time. We've been using AI and fall detention detection. We've been using AI,
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.640]   the EKG stuff. So we have AI throughout our experience. We just we're just being cautious.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.720]   And we're being we're being safe and we're being secure, which is completely valid.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:31.520]   Stephen Kovac asked him about layoffs. He said, that's a last Tim Cook said that's a last resort.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:35.680]   And so mass layoffs, not something we're talking about at this moment. That's good news in a tech
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.160]   industry that has laid off hundreds of thousands this year. Yeah. And they're still hiring. That
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   was that was a CNBC interview that they gave I think just before the earnings call. And so
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.000]   they're saying we're still hiring just not as just not as we're slowing down that rate just
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.760]   a lower levels level than we were before. We're doing all the right things are challenging the
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.200]   things that we spend. We're finding a few more ways to save on it. This is, of course, a message
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:04.320]   to investors. We're frugal. We're being careful. Yeah. So as mentioned cutting corners where they
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.280]   can again, not as desperate as not as desperate as you know, Google probably saying, we're still
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.920]   using disposable flatware, but we're asking people to not throw the way just rinse them,
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.480]   keep them in your pocket. That's your spoon for the week. Yeah.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:24.560]   Anything else that we gleaned from the earnings call or interviews per year post?
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:33.440]   A lot of it was a lot of Apple's message was all about emerging markets and because they were,
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:39.760]   they did have to admit that there was a lot of slowdown in the US markets. But however,
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:45.200]   they're basically talking about India, not just as for manufacturing, but as a new market that's
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.160]   kind of one question, one caller actually compared it a little bit to the situation and their
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.120]   opportunities in China about 10 or 15 years ago. And Tim Cook said specifically that, yeah,
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.720]   we think that there's a big opportunity, often because again, hitting upon the question about
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.640]   China, there's a lot of people who are entering the middle class and those people now have money
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:11.360]   to spend on luxurious brands. They didn't even call themselves a luxurious brand. But you know,
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.640]   what you're talking about here, yeah, what I do see in India is a lot of people entering the
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.760]   middle class and I'm hopefully can convince some number of them to buy an iPhone as well as see
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.320]   how that works out, but it's working out well.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:28.080]   You also have to say that the Apple savings account has had a critical response to the
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.840]   high-end savings. Yeah, we know that. That was another drumbeat.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:37.760]   Yeah, wow, that was a huge success. Apple made enough money that they're going to do another
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.160]   90 billion in buybacks. And of course, that helps the stock quite a bit.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.640]   Right. When they get out, because that drives up revenue, but that's also starting to become a
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.000]   little bit more controversial because even if you're not like quasi socialist saying, well,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.720]   how can you help? Why don't you put some of that money back into improving worker situations?
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:02.960]   But a lot of it is that even Congress is, I think the SEC is putting a new rules that are going
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:09.280]   to affect in the fall about how look you can't be invested. We are calling it a stock buyback,
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.800]   but under rules that we abandoned a bunch of years ago, that's basically investing in your own
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.360]   company using insider information. So we are putting it to affect a whole bunch of new rules
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:25.040]   about how you can do buybacks, including basically you have to announce exactly each
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.360]   the 90 billion dollar in buybacks basically means that the board has approved 90 billion dollars
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:35.040]   worth over the coming season, depending on opportunities that Apple sees. So the government is basically
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:40.240]   saying now that you have to explain every single transaction when you make it, you have to explain
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.880]   why you're making it, why you're making this quantity of investment, why you're making it now,
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:50.320]   basically to make sure that they're not playing some tricks saying that, hey, we know that our stock
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.880]   is going to tank in the next two months because we're going to have to announce that this thing
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.960]   where this device where you charge both the phone and the watch on the same thing is never going to
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.360]   work and we want to make sure that we get value out of the company or we do whatever we have to do
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.960]   before then. So it's a little bit of controversy there. But on saving discounts, that was another
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:14.720]   drum beat thing where a lot of questions even when you can always tell by part of the messages that
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.760]   when they try to weave a success into every as many answers as they can possibly make it,
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.520]   and Apple saves and accounts was one of them. They were asked specifically by, well, how do you see
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:32.480]   this as an ongoing driver of revenue? And that the interesting response in that he didn't, Tim Cook
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:38.800]   specifically was not talking and talking about it as a product, revenue generating products so much
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:44.080]   as like he directly compared to the part of the Apple Health portfolio saying that the Apple Watch
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.880]   will help you be healthy with exercise, heart beats, keeping on your stats and things like that.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:54.640]   We think that our financial products are basically also helping people to build financial health
[00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.320]   and wealth health. So that was interesting. Again, they're not talking to the press. They are talking
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.720]   to analysts. We're going to be directing like hundreds of millions of dollars on investment
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.560]   money, depending on what he says. The fact that he declined to say that we're hoping to make some
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.240]   money off of this is either a shows that he's very much taking the long view about when they can
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:22.640]   make this profitable. Or he is being very, again, he's Tim Cook. He is coded with Teflon. He's got
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.520]   nothing to worry about in terms of his position or Apple stock. The fact that he is declining to
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.040]   say that we're trying to make money off of this, we're actually just trying to create an Apple Health
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:38.080]   product and basically get people. And if there's a business aspect to it, to get people more entwined
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.840]   into the Apple ecosystem, meaning to, again, we don't want to just sell somebody a laptop or an iPad
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:51.120]   or watch. We want to create a new customer that we can then make money off of for the X510,
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:56.000]   1520 years. Interesting. It was a funny comparison to the to the fitness thing. But apparently they
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.320]   only want financial fitness in the US. No, Apple Card and iPhone users.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.000]   Well, you can't blame my mom. Android users can die in the street for
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.600]   and homeless. That was your fault for not buying an Apple watch. You should have bought an Apple
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.480]   watch. I mean, it's so hard just to get up to work in the United States, let alone. Oh, I can
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.600]   imagine the banking regulations you'd have to face and all that stuff. That's crazy. Yeah, fully.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.320]   I just realized that ran and got my I'm so excited. And now that their final cut is coming out on the
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.840]   iPad, I can use my bridge keyboard with my with my. That is an investment you're going to love.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:42.160]   Rest of your because it feels good that you're investing again, becoming a customer and just
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.920]   part of the ecosystem and part of that tribe. It just I can myself got a bridge tattoo on the
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:54.080]   back of my neck here. I'm so happy about it. You know, this was I bought it early on before
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:01.920]   Apple obviously came out with its own magic keyboard with a real trackpad. This looked kind of cool
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.200]   to go with because it's heavy. It's aluminum. You know, I mean, it's a real keyboard, not a
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:14.560]   kind of click like not like a fake keyboard as as nice as the Apple magic. I love my Apple magic
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.000]   keyboard. It feels it feels like you've got a tablet with a mobile thing on the bridge was
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.720]   great and that they basically said if you want if you wanted to feel like a laptop, damn it,
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.800]   we'll give you a laptop. Yeah, but I used it for about one day because it weighed like
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:39.040]   places. I got the magic the Apple magic keyboard and I was like, no, so I've had this bridge keyboard
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.400]   in my drawer. I just realized and then of course the story came out this week that bridge has
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.480]   basically gone completely belly up staff unpaid orders, unfulfilled. I seem to remember this was
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.920]   a I want to say kickstart. I feel like was crowds crowdsourced originally. It's important because
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.680]   it really felt like a brand that would be around a long time. And it was one thing when the iPad
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.360]   launched with a smart connector at first, I feel like I could be wrong, but in the announcement,
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.960]   it was like, you know, this smart connector is going to, you know, bring a whole new wave of
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.040]   accessories for the iPad and all that. And it didn't really happen that way. You know,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.480]   even with a lot of those bridge keyboards, you still just have to do a Bluetooth connection.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.640]   And it's just not ideal. Like I don't want to charge another device. The magic keyboard is the
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:28.000]   ideal solution for me. So it's unfortunate. 95 Mac talked to some former employees who said,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.040]   yeah, I mean, the company was mismanaged during growth. There were misleading statements from its
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:41.920]   two co CEOs and overall hostile working environment. I don't know anything about that. I think,
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.120]   regardless, impossible to compete against Apple, if they're going to sell a similar product.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.040]   And this is the problem Apple has, you know, the ecosystem for add-ons for, you know,
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.000]   Apple stuff is severely limited because of what Apple, you know, they don't make a dock. So there's
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.640]   a dock business, right? Unless you're a partner like Logitech and you can write things like the
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.600]   crayon that Apple literally will talk about in the keynotes and pushing the whole store as almost.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.440]   Well, they were, I think they were selling the bridge in the Apple store briefly, anyway.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:19.680]   Yeah, they were. Yeah. They do mention this like in the 95 Mac article is really, really good.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.960]   They talked to a lot of people and they had they dipped into a lot of their own experience and
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.560]   knowledge about it. And yeah, they mentioned that for instance, when the magic keyboard came out,
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   it could naturally as an Apple product for an Apple iPad running an iPad OS, it could do things
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.240]   that no third party keyboard could possibly do. And like Steven said, when Apple often will
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.120]   work with a third party, third party manufacturers and kind of lift them up if they can, if that
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.080]   company can make something that Apple doesn't think it can do a great job or just make it good fit with.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:54.320]   Remember that when Apple like a few, was it five years ago or something, when they had their big
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.680]   iPad education event and they decided, look, we need education can't necessarily spend $100
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.240]   for an Apple pencil. So not only will we so we will basically have was it Logitech create
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:10.960]   the Apple crayon, create a crayon for the iPad that is almost as good as just not quite so,
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.920]   so important. So yeah, they'll partner with you. But you boy, if you're not as tight as
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:23.440]   Apple and Logitech are watch out. Yeah, they do quote some guy named Jason Snell, who said that
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:29.600]   the bridge trackpad was quote, not remotely close to Apple's trackpad in class. He described
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:35.520]   the final product as being an imprecise jerky experience that was simply no good. So yeah,
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:42.000]   thank you, Jason for killing bridge. That's your fault. That's okay. That's okay. I know I got
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.120]   a cousin who's into laser. He'll give me a discount if I put my monitor Instagram. But yet and to be
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.920]   fair, this is why it can really really bite you in the bite in the butt because it's not that they
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.200]   made a defective product is that the only way they could get at that point, the only way they
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.440]   could get the trackpad to work, because third party pointing off, excuse me, third party pointing
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.760]   devices were not supported in iPad at west of that point was to do kind of a hack and basically
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.560]   make it into an accessibility hack so that it would basically turn accessibility and basically use
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.440]   it as an accessibility third party pointer, which was really not necessarily optimized for that
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.320]   kind of thing. It was great that they got it working at all. But it's not something that when you
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:22.720]   got something someone like Jason Snell, who's no fool, who's just basically gonna say, I'm not
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.880]   gonna accept any excuses. I'm gonna tell you that this was a pain to the butt to use. Yeah,
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.920]   that's gonna be bad.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:33.280]   It's actually got the bridge touchpad. It was actually a standalone magic trackpad device.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.800]   It was nicely black and it was USB C. The reason I got it was because I didn't want to
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.920]   have lightning anymore. I was trying to go all USB C. But even that was just wireless touchpad.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.880]   It just wasn't as good. Like it just wasn't good enough to you.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.400]   It's too bad. But that's what happens in the world. So if anybody wants to buy this,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:57.760]   give you a good deal. No, no, you can't have, John, why would you want to buy a John Ashley?
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.800]   What would you do with it? You don't want to buy it, really.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.600]   I'm gonna keep it. It's gonna go in my library of $5 failed yet.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.800]   No, I'm not gonna eat it. This is a nice box. It was a great product. I thought it was a very
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.960]   interesting product. Do you think it will work with the Google Pixel tablet next month? Maybe?
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:23.360]   Maybe? Hey, I should ask you, and if you want to join us tomorrow at 10,
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.440]   I forgot that you cover Android stuff unless you're doing it for material.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.080]   No, well, I'm gonna be paying attention for material. But if you would like to join us,
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.880]   we would love to have you. Jeff Jarvis and I are gonna do the keynote tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:42.960]   Pacific for Google. I-O. I-O. It's off to where we go.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:52.240]   Apple has... Well, this is a weird headline from Bloomberg Law, so I'm gonna go with it.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:59.120]   Apple fails to fully reboot iOS simulator copyright case. You may remember Corellium
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:06.640]   made a security research tool that emulated iPhones. That was a useful thing for security
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.960]   researchers. On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that that
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.400]   assimilator is protected by fair use. They had to go all the way to the Court of Appeals for it.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.240]   In Corsec, which is the name of the simulator, further scientific progress by allowing
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:34.560]   security research into important operating systems. It's okay, and Apple says, "Okay, fine.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.600]   We're gonna drop it. This suit's been going on since 2019."
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.680]   And they've lost every step of the way. They pursued it all the way to the Eleventh Circuit.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.560]   So this is good news, I think. Fair use has a posse anyway in the Eleventh Circuit.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:56.320]   I think it's been made. I think it's a... I don't think that's... It's moot now.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.240]   I think that Apple's kind of like, "Okay, well, there's nothing to do about it now."
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.960]   And for a little company that did this, Apple tying you up in court is a pretty expensive process,
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.840]   so I think that might have been also... Make sure that everybody thinks about going down that
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.880]   path because that's hundreds of thousands of dollars that it costs to go to court.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:23.600]   That level of case is not $10. And so I think that even if Apple loses sometimes...
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.320]   Definitely work for large companies that just tell people, "Yeah, we know we can't win,
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.960]   but it's still gonna cost you a half million dollars."
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.240]   So you're like, "This is the cost. Just make sure that it's worth it."
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.080]   Apple, I mean, Corellium did have some support from third parties like Public Knowledge,
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.680]   who felt that this was an important case to defend. So I don't know how much of it came out of their
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.680]   pocket, but of course that's a long four years in court. And you can see why Apple fought it
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.200]   for so long. The line that they can't let anybody cross is, "Hey, we made something that can
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.440]   run, that can pretend to be an Apple computer and run the software or at least convincingly do it,
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.560]   even if it's something as important as running security checks and trying to investigate the
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.240]   vulnerabilities. But yeah, they don't want that door open even to crack."
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.000]   We mentioned that the EU continues and probably this summer we'll tell Apple,
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.520]   you're gonna have to have a third party store at Google as well in their play store. Also,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:29.120]   a little warning from the EU coming specifically from EU Industry Commissioner Terry Breton
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.760]   about Apple's plans to or reported plans to implement and made for iPhone certification.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:42.960]   On USB accessories, USB-C accessories, and the fear is, or the thing Terry is addressing is
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.880]   that Apple produced chargers might allow faster charging speeds than iPhone 15.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.640]   I actually don't think that what they seem to miss there unless someone misread it or
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.960]   everybody misread it is. The made for iPhone will probably have to do with data, whether it
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   passes data or not. I think they're gonna let you charge all you want. But if you're not made for
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.600]   iPad, you won't be able to connect to the device that actually can talk to it.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.080]   This is only about charging. This is only about charging and Breton is merely saying,
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:23.040]   we will stop iPhones from being sold in the EU if you try to skirt our new USB-C charging policy.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:29.440]   Apple will have a USB-C charger. They don't have to this year. I think they have to buy next year.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.080]   By the end of next year, they theoretically release one more product.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.240]   There are two more. They can do the 15 and the 16 and still be in line.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.600]   But it's not totally surprising that the EU would basically issue this warning and do it in such a
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.400]   public way saying, you're not gonna get around this by saying, "Hey, great. You can charge for
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.480]   third-party chargers. Enjoy your five-watt 18-hour to a full-charge thing. Worth the fight,
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.040]   wasn't it, everybody?" Because that would have been petty and stupid, but you could totally see
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   Apple doing that. I'm not saying they would do that. I'm saying that I don't know that they wouldn't
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.720]   do that. The only thing is that the only question would be is, could they charge it faster if both
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.320]   devices are talking to each other? It has to do with over driving the battery and so on and so forth.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.880]   That if they have something, because the problem really is, is that you buy all these chargers and
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.160]   the chargers are varying level of... USB-C is a commoditized product. There's a lot of things that
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.880]   aren't great that are released with it. The thing is that you could argue that Apple would want to
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.680]   have the devices be able to talk to each other so that they can manage the power that's going to
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:48.640]   the phone. That would be the reason that you'd want to have your own closed system to make that
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.640]   actually work. Apple can do a lot of other things like put your USB-C in and then have something on
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:00.960]   the back that charges really fast. That isn't... There's a lot of ways to work around it.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.360]   Well, it'll be interesting to see what Apple does. I don't think I'd play this on iPhone 14 Pro
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:11.280]   more than once to lightning. I charge with MagSafe in the car at overnight and so even with this USB-C
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.960]   port, even when I travel, I bring the MagSafe Duo still because it's funny. You're 100% right.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:24.560]   What's really interesting is that I pepoot Mags. I pepoot the inductance charger for a long
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.280]   time. Then I got that one from my car and now I'm addicted. I just put these little things
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.600]   everywhere. I set my phone on it. I can't remember the last time I plugged my phone into anything.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.440]   I wouldn't be surprised if the base models of the iPhone come without any connector
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.280]   in the next couple of years. The pros will probably stay there because you have to move a lot of data.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.520]   But I wouldn't be surprised if Apple just closes it off completely.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.960]   See, my problem, I would... I wireless charge for everything I do. I like having a wallet case.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:59.280]   The charger doesn't go through this. I have to plug it in. I would be disturbed if I couldn't
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:08.160]   have my nice thick wallet case. You have that peak case, Alex. The peak charge was fantastic.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:15.600]   I can put my ID and my credit card in something that's only attached to my phone magnetically.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.560]   I'm sorry. That works great. I did in Europe because I wanted to have, for some reason.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.360]   I can't remember. There was a reason. I was going to use my phone as a camera and I didn't want to
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:31.520]   have this. That's exactly why I moved to it. The problem really is not so much the bottom part
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.640]   of the wallet case, but this silly, thriss strap, which for some reason, every time got in my picture.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.000]   So enough problems with my thumb getting in my picture. I don't want another thing that can get
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.920]   my picture. So yeah, I used the peak case, which I love. But that has special charging.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.280]   That is a special, hard magnetic thing. I mean, it's not. And you still have to take the wallet
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:59.760]   off to do it. It's still a lot easier. Well, I mean, but for you, I'm really a big proponent of choice.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:06.080]   I have wireless chargers in the house. I don't prefer them. When it comes down to the...
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.720]   my battery is down to the end of the day, my battery is down to 12 or 13%. I like plugging
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.200]   it a cable. It's just more convenient. It's going to be there. I've got this. I've got this charging
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.160]   cable that can be used for 18 different things inside my house. It just as opposed to having this
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.040]   plugged into a wireless charger that can only be used with like maybe three or four things. But
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.200]   it would be a turtleneck if Apple didn't support USB power delivery, which is an independent
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:39.120]   standard supports 5 amp charging. And that again, that would be kind of turtlish. I'm with you when
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:45.120]   it comes to the ability to create a custom protocol that can do a much, much more intelligent and
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.440]   much more safe aversion to charging and get high speed, but also without overheating, without
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.120]   damaging the battery, that's a big, big priority. But for them, I think power delivery has to be
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.320]   table stakes for any USB-C charge phone. I think that what's interesting is that Apple could...
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.600]   there's a fine line there, which is that Apple could deliver something that will charge just as
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:11.920]   fast, but the battery will last longer if you use the Mate 5 phone version because it's going to
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.480]   condition that power. And I think that that's going to be a really hard one because if you plug
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:22.080]   it in and test it, it'll be fine. But over a year or two years, if the device is able to talk to
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.120]   it, it's going to change the... it's going to vary that. It'll be interesting to see how that goes.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.080]   Yeah. But power delivery wasn't designed by chimps. I mean, they took that in consideration.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.560]   And when you're talking about the difference between, "Hey, this phone will last me seven years
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.040]   versus this phone battery will last me four and a half years."
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:44.960]   I did a video on a MagSafe battery packs. And I compared a bunch of different ones. And when it
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.040]   comes to just the heat generated from a lot of these third-party MagSafe batteries, like,
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.640]   I just don't trust it. It gets too hot. And so when it comes to charging my phone,
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.080]   I know it was really poo-pooed by a lot of people. But Apple's first-party MagSafe battery pack,
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.240]   it's the one I go to because it's the only one that feels like they've found that balance of
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.560]   actually charging it and temperature. And I don't feel like my battery health is going to take a
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:11.280]   10% hit after using this pack for a few times. And again, I think it's really going to be about
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.400]   the made from iPhone is going to be really about data. It's not going to be about power.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.560]   Yeah. Like it's stuff that made it... Data and devices. I mean, if you don't think you probably
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.800]   are not going to be able to... if the day in which you can attach an external camera to an iPad,
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.040]   it's going to have to be a made for iOS or made for iPad device certified.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.600]   I do want to mention I put the link in the show notes, but the ESR MagSafe wallet, I know you don't
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.520]   want to have like cards on this magnet thing, but the ESR wallet built in Find My. So it has
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.600]   Find My on this MagSafe wallet and not like the Apple MagSafe wallet Find My where if it just
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.800]   disconnects and marks the location. This has like legit Find My not precision locations, but
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.440]   you know, Find My like chipola devices and stuff. And then you can have the cards as a loop where
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.680]   you can like hold it with your finger and the whole case actually is a stand for your iPhone. So
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.800]   the ESR wallet, I recommend. So the, I mean, the peak magnetic wallet is...
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.320]   I mean, it didn't fall off while I was in Europe. It made me nervous.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.760]   So I imagine this is true too. You can have a really strong magnet on these MagSafe backs.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.240]   Well, I have it because I have the peak, you know, that attaches to your event.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.880]   Oh, I have the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bought like...
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.840]   When it snaps on, it snaps. It's on. They were sponsored.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:29.360]   It's not good. And I bought everything. I have two different bicycle mounts. I have everything.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.200]   And even, you know what I really like, there was a little sticky magnet that you put on your
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:44.080]   bedside table and the phone goes right onto that. That's really nice. But I want to be able to
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:49.520]   carry safely. You know, my driver's license and my credit cards are protected in this wallet. And
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.560]   plus, I love the idea that the wallet protects the front of the
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.280]   screen. So if I drop it, as long as it's closed, I'm happy.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.760]   I have a screen protector on it. And I guess the...
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.000]   Apple can't be sure about it. Apple, you guys don't do Apple here?
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.400]   Yeah, but well, I mean... I still don't want to bring my phone.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.400]   My wife is so happy with that because I gave her my 13 and it was in mint condition.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.560]   Because it literally when I get it... The phones are always...
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.920]   It goes into a case. Yeah.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.440]   Okay, the screen protector goes on. It's like in the look of the...
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.600]   I don't have any condition. I don't have no screen protector or anything.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.120]   Just got Apple care. No problem.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.960]   I get Apple. Will they replace it if it just scratched? A little couple of scratches?
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.280]   Like I don't have any scratches. I do have a scratch. I do have a scratch.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.600]   I do have a couple of scratches that bother me. I can't look too closely.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:37.600]   See? See? You like one of those trust fund kids. You just, you know,
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.120]   wrap the new Lambo around it, around it, around it, Paul. Don't worry, Daddy will buy me a new one.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:49.280]   I got car, Daddy Care Plus. Those of us with good, rough working man hand,
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.040]   working person hands, we have to take care of the day. My kids, both my kids,
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.560]   phones are bashed and battered and cracked. And when I say, "Let's get a new one," they say, "No.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.040]   They don't want to look fancy. They want to look like working people."
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.160]   So they have... You have old phones. I'm putting on notions. Very nice.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.040]   I had two tests, the 12s that I had to use for work. And we finally, I gave them to my kids.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.920]   And they didn't have any problems with it.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.840]   It didn't bother them at all. No, wait until their teenage...
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.000]   This peer pressure doesn't happen until they're... Oh, they're teenagers, really?
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.320]   Yeah, they're teenagers. They're 14 and 15 now.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:30.560]   Oh my God. I can't believe this. I thought they were babies still.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.120]   A living in the dead.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:38.880]   Well, okay. Maybe a little older then. But they're maybe not. But it felt like there was
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.000]   severe peer pressure because I gave them Daddy Care Plus.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.480]   I told them, "You got Daddy Care Plus."
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.960]   I don't know if it's a new generation or the last generation or the next generation. My kids
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.680]   feel no peer pressure. They want shiny new products.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.240]   You want to get on Snap because she's not on any social media.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.160]   Yeah. No, if someone wants to talk to me, they have to come over and get my phone number.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.520]   Like they have to ask, "Wow."
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.840]   She's just like, "No." So they're not normal. You're there.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.600]   You're abnormal. That's why. Okay.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.600]   You have that normal soldier. My son's 14 also. But there is peer pressure about the green bubbles
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.160]   because he's been in a cold. Oh, yeah. He's talking about that.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.080]   He's talking about that. You're kidding. Your kid doesn't have it.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.400]   That is one where my parents get my parents. My kids go, "Oh, yeah. You don't want a green bubble."
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:25.120]   Like they're like, they're like, "No one." Everyone, you get dropped out of the...
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.560]   Oh, yeah. You're not the group. You're not the group. You miss all the parties.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.920]   Yeah. You know, if we've been...
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.680]   That is intense. I will say they don't have any peer pressure except for the green bubble.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.320]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.640]   Nobody wants a green bubble. Because they just feel like your parents don't care enough to get you enough.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.440]   Yeah. You know what? We have with the coronation and everything.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   We hear the US. We've been awfully smug, but at least we didn't grow up with a class system.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.920]   Yeah. Well, we do. We just... It's the news and the news.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.520]   It's a crypto-class system.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.920]   We pray to a different golden god.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.880]   And it's a glowing white apple.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.280]   What's fascinating now is that I guess the numbers are like 80% under 18 or something
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.280]   that are using iPhones. Really?
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.560]   And so I was telling you, the beginning, you know, be the cool kid.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.760]   Even if you're not, act like it. And...
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.200]   Hello, fellow chiefs. Make sure you conform.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.960]   Because it's the conformists who...
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   Two hundred rock stars and movie stars.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:20.640]   People who just do exactly what the guidance counselor tells them to do.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   Here's the different...
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.520]   And into that good school. Knuckle down hard. It'll pay off in the end.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.720]   Final EU story. Well, it's not the EU story. Well, it is in the EU story.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:38.080]   So the UK regulator who's feeling his notes right now after shutting down the Microsoft
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.920]   Activision deal, the competition's in markets.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.480]   Donuts for the whole office.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.520]   Yeah. Donuts for the whole office. Look at our power.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.160]   Here we are. Not even in the EU.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:58.240]   So they were trying to open an investigation into Apple's mobile browser and cloud gaming services.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:05.600]   And the EU said, "No, I'm not going to do it. The competition appeal tribunal."
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.560]   Maybe it's different in another language, but the word tribunal in English...
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.120]   It doesn't have a good sound.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:18.960]   Anyway, they quashed the decision to open an investigation and refused Britain's antitrust
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:24.400]   regulator permission to appeal that ruling.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.960]   You are right. If you're going to call it a tribunal, there need to be flanked by two
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.560]   Klingons carrying pain sticks.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:37.840]   The competition and market authority don't make me laugh.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:46.480]   The competition and market authority can still appeal to the court of appeal.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.640]   They haven't decided yet if they're going to do that.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.920]   Why? I don't...
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:54.960]   Celebrate your Activision victory and leave it at that.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.320]   Well, again, they got the Activision victory, but they did get Charles.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.040]   So yeah, right. There you go. Two steps forward, two steps back.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:10.080]   Did you get up early and watch the coronation, Andy?
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.520]   Feels like you're a way out.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.480]   You might have.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.080]   No, I just think it's funny as hell when you have like...
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:21.440]   I think these things are funny as hell where you have like these 2,000 people in this room.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:27.520]   Some of them are like, they got their OB or whatever, like 18 years ago, and they're like,
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.000]   "Yes, it's good to be part of the system and you have to be recognized like this."
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.040]   And then like you see like a pop star come in who's just a great person who's like,
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.800]   "Hey, is this my seat? Is this my seat? Is that what you're seeing?"
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.480]   And all the infantile stuff about...
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.920]   I wish I had enough time in my day to figure out what the deal is with Charles's kids
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.600]   and why they're beefing with each other.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.120]   I really... I don't care enough.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.640]   So I'm just gonna listen to all these commentators like,
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:59.440]   "Oh, you notice that he's a dude bro. He's not just two idols behind.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.200]   He's also to the left, not to the right. He's seated to the left. Perhaps that's why the...
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.560]   The princess of Wales is wearing that hat with that feather so that the cameras would not even
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.040]   have them in the... I'm like, "I don't care."
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.320]   Just bring a line on Richie.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:16.880]   Go get this.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.640]   Let's take a little break.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.200]   I'm going to be trying to mention...
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:21.760]   Go ahead.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.320]   Oh, sorry.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:22.560]   No.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.200]   Real quick, just this CUP gray video, I'll put the link.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.120]   It's the difference between the UK, Great Britain, and England.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120]   And it's an old video, but it's hilarious.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.720]   It even explains like the crown and all the territories and how it's all like terminology
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:37.120]   to together.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:37.600]   Oh, it's crazy.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:38.800]   Great video.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.520]   The... He's British, right?
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.960]   Or no?
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.320]   He lives in London, but he's American.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.920]   He's American, but he lives in London.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.320]   I am not British.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.000]   I'm just gonna say that with...
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.800]   I mean, he chose the scheduling for this.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.800]   Why he chose to schedule it like days before the Eurovision Song Contest,
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.880]   where there's gonna be all kinds of unflattering comparisons about the pageantry
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.600]   and the entertainment value and how invested people are in this.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.280]   He's not gonna come off well.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.240]   Because people can be way more interested in Eurovision than in his coronation.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.320]   Very good lead.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.280]   iOS 16.5 release candidate.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.040]   Not... RC does not stand for a real coronation.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.960]   Stands for release candidate.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.360]   iPad OS 16.5 release candidate.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.120]   Mac OS 13.4.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.960]   Watch OS 9.5 and TV OS 16.5.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.760]   All the RCs came out today.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.240]   What is... They all came out to play.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:36.960]   What does that mean?
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.080]   I don't know that there's...
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:43.040]   I don't think... I haven't seen anybody who said there's any kind of breakthrough features.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.040]   It was kind of interesting in that Apple doesn't talk about unannounced products,
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.920]   but they did like accidentally or just who cares sort of mentioned that when they press release
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.880]   about the Pride bands said that, "Oh, it's going... These Pride bands... The Pride bands and the Pride
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:03.760]   watch face are gonna be released this day next week. It will require a watch OS 16.5 and iOS 16.5,
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.000]   so that, "Oh, so that means that you're releasing 16.5 on that state. We have a scoop."
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.120]   I think the only notable thing is the sports ball tab in the news app.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.680]   I'm dedicated sports tab.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:22.080]   Apple does these Pride bands every year, and usually when they do the Pride bands,
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.880]   they release wallpaper to go with it.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.520]   And I guess... I mean, I don't think there's anything else that will require an update in the
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.920]   Apple price system. It's probably the wallpaper that's gonna come with it.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.720]   It's cool they do that every year. I mean, I think that they now use it
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.360]   in themselves, but they said a trend that now, if you have any kind of wearable,
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:49.280]   you can now you can get the Pride band for your Fitbit. I don't know if the Pixel watch
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.800]   is making enough money to generate a custom Pride band, but that's a really, really cool thing,
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.320]   and I'm glad they do it every year. Yeah.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.960]   Well, and it's $49 every year. It's kind of a nice little...
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.320]   Catching. Catching.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:09.680]   So the band does match the wallpaper. It's not my favorite band.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.240]   I agree. It does have nice Pride bands, but not this one, I think.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.240]   It can double as a birthday band. Yeah, it looks like a birthday cake.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.640]   It's not like the rainbow stripes that they usually have some kind of birthday cake.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.400]   Which I really liked. Yeah. Maybe they just ran out of ideas.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.040]   Exactly. How many times can you...
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.160]   It's kind of an ask.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:38.000]   Apple's former head of iCloud is now working for General Motors.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.800]   Remember that GM decided they were not going to support CarPlay or Android Auto in their
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:55.120]   future vehicles. So this guy who... My gabbard who worked at Apple for iCloud Services and
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.720]   Infrastructure did eye message and FaceTime. He will be Executive Vice President of Software,
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:06.240]   so presumably responsible for whatever General Motors puts in their cars instead of CarPlay.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:12.400]   We have a Chevy bolt that has CarPlay. I'm not buying a car without CarPlay. Sorry. In fact,
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.200]   Ford even said, "We lost that battle 10 years ago."
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:23.360]   Which is true, because the car software is never as good as Apple and Google can do.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.160]   I think especially where GM's coming from. They're not coming from trying to
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.040]   create a better service. They're coming from trying to make more money.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.680]   So they're coming from bleeding us, just bleeding us a little bit more.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:40.080]   That position, where they're coming from when they develop this, is how do we squeeze a
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.800]   little more money out of the consumer is never going to build a better product.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.480]   And they don't have enough juice. The problem is they have a commoditized product that
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.880]   isn't no one cares about. No one cares about it in the sense that, "I have to have a GM."
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:55.280]   If you're buying a Tesla, you're buying a Tesla. You might get over that.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.280]   But you're buying a GM, you could just as well buy a Ford.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.800]   Like in the silver.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.120]   I agree.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:29:59.600]   It doesn't really.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:29:59.920]   Right.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:03.600]   The problem is that other people just be like, "They can buy a Honda, Ford, a Volvo,
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.640]   whatever." They're not in a place where they'd have to come up with something that is
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.040]   truly different for people to be willing to put up with not having something that
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:20.000]   everybody uses in their product. And so I think it'd be really interesting to see how this
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.680]   turns out for them. I'm looking forward to it. I would pop corn.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.360]   It's too bad. I think actually the Chevy Bolt is a great EV. I was very happy with it.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.320]   I was interested in their new platform, the Altium platform.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.080]   But they discontinued the Bolt so they could do Altium.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.480]   And they're not going to put carplay in the next generation.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.720]   So yeah, I'm glad we built the model. It's worked out so well.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.800]   So dumb. It's just off the table. I mean, some reason I didn't buy a Tesla either, to be honest.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.840]   There is nothing better than Apple CarPlay.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.320]   Because you're getting a new phone every few years, you're getting new operating systems
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.880]   updates all the time, it's just always going to be more up to date than anything a car manufacturer
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.720]   can do. Jim Farley is right. They lost that battle. It's done.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.520]   I actually just recently got carplay, but by a third party, like little screen that you put in,
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.720]   it's called the Carparide. I have an older car, so there was no chance I was going to get like
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.120]   built in CarPlay. But now that I've used it for the first time, since it's launched,
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.800]   yeah, I'm not going to use anything else.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.720]   And you control it. Yeah.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.760]   It's all the info.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:30.320]   And I will say that when all things are even, if a car manufacturer actually puts in the entire
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.680]   CarPlay display that Apple was showing is like, this is what's there.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.200]   Oh, I'll buy that one. Yeah.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.840]   There's a lot of people that are going to go, "Oh, I'm just going to buy that."
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:45.120]   Because again, for most cars, they all fit into a little box of, there's a sedan,
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:51.040]   they have a truck, they have a van, they have a, but I don't look at it like, "Oh, I have to have
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:55.200]   the Chevy van." I mean, I look at it like, "Well, there's like four vans, and I'll play around with
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.160]   it, and I'll look at what the features are." And so I think that there's not that many cars that
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:05.280]   stand out that are within a reasonable price range. And so I think that most of them are just like
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.520]   some basic things that you like a little bit better than others. And so I think that that's
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:15.040]   going to be really hard for GM. I think they're going to actually take a pretty big hit from that,
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:21.120]   because there's going to be a lot of people who buy car, who oftentimes have more disposal
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.680]   income. They're not going to buy those cars because they're just going to be like, "Oh, I can just go get
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:31.520]   a." But we hired the former head of iCloud. What do you guys want? And they're also apparently
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   having Google help them on that OS. And part of the thing, Google Auto or something running underneath
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:41.840]   probably. No, it's going to be something new, but part of the deal is that, "Hey, we'll help you out,
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:45.840]   but are you going to, what kind of map are you going to be using in that you think it's going to be
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.040]   Google Maps?" Oh, yeah, they're, I think they already said it'll be Google Maps. I think they already
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.120]   said that. So Google services will be wired. It won't be Android Auto, but it will be. So there's a
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.160]   yeah, it would be nice if you had the choice. Those of us who are aware enough to say, "Look,
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.520]   if I don't want to have Google, as bad enough, the GM is going to be monetizing all my telemetry
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.040]   off of this car, do I have to have another huge company doing it as well?" Or at least,
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:14.000]   Apple's a $2 billion, $2 trillion company, but I kind of trust them to only want to be the only
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.920]   company that makes money off of me and exploits me as opposed to helping other people to do that.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.760]   And I have to admit, I used to immediately put Google Maps onto my phone, and that's what
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:29.360]   that's just all I used on the iPhone. I have gotten to the point where actually Apple Maps
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:35.840]   I hate better than Google Maps. And it took a long time. I hesitate to say that,
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.680]   but because you get used to it because you hit the link and it pops open automatically, and you
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.000]   kind of used to it when I go back to Google Maps, I kind of feel like I'm going backwards now.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.560]   Like, I just feel like the display and some of the wonkiness that it has when I'm trying to find
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:56.400]   something is the Apple Maps is actually after years, because I mean, I didn't start using Apple
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.200]   Maps as a primary map thing until maybe six months ago. It's a function of where you are,
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:07.520]   though, Alex. Don't use it in Rome. Because, yeah, Lisa and I had a little battle because I used
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.400]   Apple Maps because I'm using my watch as we're not driving, we're walking, and I wanted my watch to
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:19.680]   subtly say turn left here. And we kept getting lost and going the wrong way. And Lisa finally
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:26.000]   just fed up, started using Google Maps. And so every day, we go walk around Rome for like hours,
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.880]   Lisa's going, no, turn left here. I said, no, but the watch said turn right. No, turn left.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:36.880]   We were battling between maps. And now maybe it was also my fault. Apple Maps did do a cool thing
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.040]   where I could, I think it was Apple Maps hold up. Yeah, it was, I could hold up the phone,
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.080]   show it some buildings, and then it would put a giant arrow on the building saying, go that way.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:53.360]   But how often Google definitely does that? Well, I use it a hell of a lot in when I'm in New York,
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:57.440]   because the number of times where it's like, I've been there long enough that I want to be
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:02.560]   one of those persons who knows if I'm on 10th Street, if I'm on 10th Avenue, where is he?
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:08.240]   To go up to and left that when he was like, no, okay, I just went two blocks, the hard direction,
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.360]   turn around. New York's a good example, because that's exactly where I,
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:19.120]   Rome in New York, the two places where I'll go the wrong way for a few blocks. And let me get over
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.400]   it. Apple's doing an amazing, Apple has been doing an amazing job. It really is the equal of Apple
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.720]   of Google Maps for a lot of things. It comes to it. It's the finer points that I think that
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:35.520]   Google still has the advantage like, okay, this is definitely the building, but where is the entrance
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:43.920]   to this building, Apple Maps? Apple starting in iOS 15 did this. And I used it a couple of times
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.840]   in Rome, but the whole idea was, I don't want to be a tourist holding up my phone saying,
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.760]   where the hell am I? I want my watch to subtly tell me which way I was going.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.720]   I actually did a side-by-side test video in the car. So I had Google Maps and Apple Maps on two
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.280]   iPhone side-by-side. And there were some parts, Apple Maps, the voice navigation,
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.960]   I actually preferred, because it would say things like, after the second line,
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.280]   I agree. I had specific voice things, but I got a lot of comments on the video from
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.640]   international viewers that said, it's just not usable. It really depends where you are. I think
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:18.800]   that's really the bottom line. And Alex, you're probably using it mostly in Silicon Valley,
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.200]   where of course, it's very good. California, or California, it works really good.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.600]   If the city is younger than 200 years old, you're not playing this on X-PROM.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.680]   You have to go to Boston at minimum to figure out that, "Oh, okay, thank you for
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:40.800]   turn left at the next corner." It's not a corner. There's a pointy bit, and then there's three ways
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.680]   to go that way. And by the way, both of them are no left turn, no left turns, but get there.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:52.160]   Rome is even, Rome reminded me a lot of Boston. It's, of course, a few thousand years older.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:37:00.800]   And it's crazy. Well, one of the things about Rome is in the old city center, you can't dig,
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:06.320]   because there's a ruin under there. And as soon as you start to dig something for that new building,
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.360]   you're going to have to be stopped and the archaeologists are going to come in. So there's
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:15.040]   no high rises, and the streets are pretty much the same layout that they were 2000 years ago.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.960]   It's horses or something. So it's crazy. And there's a lot of cobblestones. So Apple Maps,
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.960]   I think even Google Maps, I think, same thing in Venice, they struggle a little bit with the
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:34.240]   weirdness. It's hard to map that stuff. It really is. The biggest advantage is when you have a,
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.440]   I'll change my answer a little bit, that you need a city that's had a huge horrific fire
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.680]   recently than 110 years ago, where they said, "Okay, guess this is horrible.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.040]   It's going to take us years to recover from this, but at least we can finally do something sensible
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.200]   with the way we live. San Francisco, perfect example. It's a grid. It's easy.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:59.120]   Go to Boston. You can see they've, they've, they've spent an entire century during the 19th century,
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.400]   literally filling in the bay to create new real estate. And you can tell because if you go to the
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:09.280]   top of the Hancock Tower, like the observatory at night, you say, "Wow, that's the only part of the
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.120]   city where all the streetlights are like in straight lines and angles." And all the streets,
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:22.800]   they're like Arlington, Boylston, Colerenden, are named in alphabetical order. It's like,
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:29.680]   this is what we could have had, had we just basically laid ways to the entire city in 1908 or something.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:35.600]   I prefer it the Boston way. I like Roblocha. It is getting lost. And there's, you know,
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.840]   as you say, there's streets that go at all different angles. And it's great.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.240]   I love it. It cuts down into the street racing too, because you know what?
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.360]   That's right. You get that quad buck bike up to like 30 miles an hour before you really have
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.800]   to bang a hard right there. You're not going to have some fun with that.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.840]   I have been, I have no experience of most cities driving because I, you know, in Rome,
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:02.880]   I love to walk. I walk. I walk before 9 a.m. Yep. And then after that, I do smart. Go early.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.720]   Yeah. Oh, my Rome's such a night. So you go out right at daybreak.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.000]   And especially during the summer, what you want. And it's like two or three hours of just walking
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.960]   around. There's nobody there. And it's awesome. That's the time really because it's really crowded
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.960]   after. Yeah. Oh, man. After about 10 a.m. I will not. I go back because I'm usually there for work.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.680]   I'm usually working by then. I fell in love with it, Alex. I would go back in a heartbeat.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.040]   I would move there in a heartbeat. I'm going to, I'm trying to talk to Father Robert. See if I can
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.960]   be a priest or just dressed like you go to restaurants. Yeah, to restaurants and try to order something
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.840]   and the way to really like, no, that's not what you're going to order. You're going to have this.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.600]   Yeah. Much better. Yeah. You can't mix this with that.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.240]   But listen to him. He knows. Capicino afternoon. Are you crazy? What are you nuts?
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:02.720]   Let's see. Apple partner Foxconn buying more land in India and Vietnam.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:09.040]   Of course, right? This continues. I mean, this is, I mean, everybody's talking.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:14.160]   A lot of analysts now are asking companies how they're de-risking China. You know, like this has
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.520]   become, you know, they're everybody's trying to move out. And it's, it's really feels, it still
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.560]   feels like an un unforced error, but both Russia and China, what they're doing, what Russia has
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:31.040]   done and what China is threatening to do. It just feels like, you know, most of the West is just like,
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.720]   we would just do business with anybody that doesn't cause too much trouble. They're not,
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:40.960]   they're like, not really that, that, you know, much of a high horse of you have to do this and this and
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:46.720]   this and this. And now they're now they just can't be there, you know. And so, so I think that that
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:53.440]   India is obviously a big opportunity for Apple. So so room, listen to this Foxconn bought a 13
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.520]   million square foot parcel of land, the equivalent of 50 Manhattan city blocks near the
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:07.360]   Bangalore airport, Lourie Airport, 37 million dollars. Nice. Great place to have a space. Perfect.
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.640]   Right. Right. Yeah. And the problem for for China is this is a permanent thing. Like, this isn't
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.920]   something that happens. Like when people start buying that kind of land and building these
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:19.840]   factories, they're not coming back, you know, and, and so it's not something that just is exact.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:26.560]   Now there's obviously huge challenges around supply chains, you know, qualified personnel,
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:33.440]   do it. I mean, you know, Chin Chin has an incredible workforce as well as a centralization of technology.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.840]   But that's been built up over years. I imagine it wasn't so sophisticated when Apple first started
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.640]   and it's taken some time. Yeah. So I mean, but again, and but I think everybody, a lot of companies,
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:48.560]   not just Apple are trying to find their way to at least be able to produce a chunk of the products
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.880]   without without that. And that's why those services are so important for Apple as well,
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.080]   because that's your lifeline. If you can't sell hardware.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:05.040]   Well, let's take a little break. And I have some picks of the week coming up from Stephen Robles.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:12.080]   It's great to have you from Apple Insider. And I didn't, I neglected to mention beard.fm,
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:18.320]   which is his YouTube podcast site. He does a lot of stuff.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.240]   Yeah, I want to say everything I do. It's it's on beard.fm.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:27.600]   You are the bearded teacher. I think that's good. Good branding, good marketing,
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.600]   video tutorials. There's a couple of podcasts there. He's a busy, busy guy. And of course,
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.920]   writes for Apple Insider as well. You've got a smart home podcast. That's pretty cool.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.480]   And then home-cated. Yeah. And then movies on the side.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.840]   You do that with Nate Baranowski. That's cool. That's cool. Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.760]   He's a 3D chalk artist in Chicago. You're kidding. I love that stuff.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.520]   He did a 3D chalk art. I'll put his Instagram during the break. Which I would love to see that.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.480]   Oh, cool. And apparently he likes movies.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:06.640]   Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy Volumes 3 yet?
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.800]   Not yet. Not yet. I need to do it. We got tickets for tonight.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.480]   Oh, there you go. Actually, I don't. I'm not going. The kid's going.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:20.480]   Lisa and the kid and her ex. It's going to be I'll let them go. It'll be fun for them.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:23.920]   You know what? I haven't been a movie theater since COVID and I don't I have no plans to. We
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.440]   have a nice TV. We've got surround sound. I make some excellent Amish country popcorn. Thanks
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.880]   to Alex Lindsey. Just tried, by the way. The I know what do they call it? Fairy popcorn,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.360]   the littlest kernel of all. Yeah, those are good too. I get your mushroom
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.840]   size because those are the big ones. I got a sampler with all the kinds they make.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:51.280]   So I got the six pound. I have the six pound of the mushroom because it's kind of your go to.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.720]   Yeah. And I get the sampler and I slowly work through all those ones as well.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.600]   It's fun. It's fun. And the sampler size is just right for the the Whirly Pop.
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:06.320]   So was it Amish? Was it called Amish country popcorn? I think so. Yeah, I buy the six pound bags as
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:12.160]   well. I don't know. I don't know where the six pounds of popcorn goes, but it goes. It really does.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:23.040]   At 160, 160 grams per per Whirly Pop. Yes. Otherwise it pushes up against the top.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.440]   Yeah, you don't want the top to pop open in.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:31.200]   And then you want it to be ready when it's ready. And that's that 165 with it just immediately is like,
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:39.440]   no pushing up there. I might. What is it? Ladyfinger. That's the little one. I might. I might buy
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.440]   six pounds of the ladyfinger. In fact, I'm going to do that right. They're good. They're really good.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.200]   It's good to have both. You never know. Right. Oh, look, I can do some scribe and say.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:55.680]   Never run out. I show today. Now you know why I've been visiting Zachtok.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:04.320]   I show today brought to you by Zachtok. When someone is really good at what they do,
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:09.440]   you know it, right? And it's it's like you feel like you're in good hands. It could be a waiter,
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:16.800]   a chef, a doctor. When you see, you know, a chef run as a restaurant run beautifully,
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:19.440]   and the chef is like in charge of stuff, you know, you're gonna have a good meal.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.840]   When you get the right doctor, same thing. You relax immediately. You're at ease. You go, I
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:31.520]   I'm being heard. The doctor is listening. She's gonna just gonna help me. Now I have to tell you
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.160]   that very everybody's different what they want. Some people want a doctor. I prefer doctors who
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:40.400]   are going to tell me everything, all the details, right? Some people don't want to know that. They
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.800]   said, tell me what to do. I don't want to know the details. Just give me the pills. Tell me when
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:50.240]   to take them and I'll do it. Zachtok helps you find the doctor that's right for you.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:57.680]   Zachtok, it's free. It's an app. You can you can put on your iPhone or your Android device.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:03.520]   It's the only free app that lets you find and book doctors and who are patient reviewed.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.000]   Plus you can sort by insurance. So you'll know they take your insurance. You can say, I want to
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.600]   make sure that I can make an appointment with them. And so you know they're available when you need
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:17.280]   them. And by the way, not just physicians, not just MDs, but chiropractors, dentists,
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.320]   all kinds, right? So they could treat almost any condition under the sun dermatologist.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:29.200]   I was looking for a guarantologist, somebody who handles the diseases of old age for an older
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:36.480]   person we care for. And Zachtok found the one in the area that took the insurance that was
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:43.040]   available. I mean, it's wonderful. No more Dr. Roulette and no more looking, you know,
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.080]   on the internet for question or review. Zachtok vets every review. You're seeing the reviews
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:52.240]   and the reviews are thorough and tell you things like this doctor will listen to you

[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:18.480]   zachtok.com/macbreak. Pick of the week time. Our special guest, Stephen Robles. What do you got for us?
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.920]   So this is a new AI tool. It's called Gling. G-L-I-N-G. Gling.
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:33.040]   So if you make video content, I do a lot of talking head videos,
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:39.520]   obviously YouTube creator content. This AI tool, you upload your raw video file.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:46.880]   Basically, it transcribes the video. The powerful feature is, Gling will remove all silences
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:57.600]   and your bad takes. How do it know? It's incredible. Typically, if you're doing talking head content,
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.000]   you might have some false stars or you say the same thing multiple times. Usually, it's
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.640]   last take that you're wanting to actually use in the finish. After you actually transcribe,
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.960]   it transcribes a video. It will show everything that it cut out, what it sees,
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:18.720]   the silences and bad takes. You can just very quickly say, "Actually, no, I want to keep that take,"
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:23.280]   or cut more out. You can even just cut individual words or whole sentences in the video.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:30.880]   It does all of that. It does an incredible job. Then you can export an XML file for Final Cut or
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.080]   do it your resolveable. Oh, you get an edit list. Oh, nice.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.880]   The reason why I didn't typically use a lot of these AI video editing tools is because I don't
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.520]   want to upload a video and then download a compressed video and then use that to edit with.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:49.440]   What I love about this tool is you just download the XML file. When you import that into Final Cut,
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:55.520]   which is what I use to edit, it just has all the cuts and it's referencing my original video file,
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:03.520]   the raw video automatically. You can even download a multi-cam XML file because the way I film videos,
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.280]   I record on my Sony mirrorless camera, but I record the audio separately into a separate
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:14.000]   wave audio file. I typically put it together in a multi-cam clip. You can do that with this
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:21.200]   Gling AI tool. I download the multi-cam XML file. I can still add an angle, put in my voiceover file,
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:28.560]   snap that, or sync it to the monitoring angle. All my cuts are still in sync. You do have to be
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.640]   careful if you're doing that multi-cam thing where your video file has to be longer than the audio,
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:40.720]   otherwise it'll bump in the multi-cam clip. The video file off and then all the cuts will be off.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.720]   So you just have to make sure hit record on the camera first and then record the audio,
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.880]   stop the audio, stop the camera kind of thing. But I've been using it for the past several days
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:56.000]   and it has saved me hours and hours of time. Have you compared it to Descript.ai, which seems similar?
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.560]   Yes. But Descript can remove filler words, but then it doesn't, you can download a compressed
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:08.320]   version. You can do 1080p and whatever. But it doesn't. I want something where I still edit in
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:16.560]   file. It doesn't give you the EDL. I like that. Yeah. By the way, if this recommendation from
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.360]   Steven has disappeared from the show, you can thank our editors who do not want you to know
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:26.640]   about this product. They don't want me to know about this gling. Yeah.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:32.320]   And it's because my first step in the process whenever I edit is to just get the raw
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:37.520]   edit. You know, I cut out all the silences, all the bad takes. Right. And so this tool has now
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:42.240]   done that first step for me. And that's usually a lot of the time-consuming part that I can
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:49.200]   add whatever overlays or whatever. And right now, you can do it for free with a video. And it's not
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:53.120]   even, there's no subscription and you can't even pay for it yet, which makes me a little nervous.
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:57.360]   I actually contacted them like, let me pay you. Please let me pay you for this because I want
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:03.280]   this to keep being developed. But right now, they just suggest $5 a video, but it's like a tip jar.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.200]   Like there's actually- Wow. Yeah. It's pretty wild. It's very early.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:11.360]   But even if they continue to charge $5, that's a good price. That's a great-
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.880]   In a way, that's better than the other pricing models because I don't know how much I'm going
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:20.960]   to do in a month or what it's worth. But if I'm doing it per video, I know, five bucks. Yeah,
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:26.560]   that's worth it. Yeah. So it now will help me with the chapter markers in YouTube because that's a
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:34.880]   constant issue. Not really. I mean, you can see the timestamps in the gling of the video, but not
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:41.680]   really. I want something like that. Yeah. This is good. I'm going to show this to our editors and
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:48.480]   they can throw stuff at me. Gling.ai. Andy, did you want to say something about it?
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:53.520]   No, no. I'm looking at the page and it's giving examples of edits that are flagging. The only
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:53:00.720]   guy I don't understand is what is a disfluency? What do you mean? What? What? They got the
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.840]   got the mark on your silence and um, adjusting camera. It's a mouthful.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.320]   You meant to say Final Cut Pro, but you said Final Pro Cut and you know, you could do it again.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:19.760]   You said here, Gling is pretty good and shows promise, but I wouldn't recommend it. I think
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:26.640]   you meant to say it's awesome. I gave them $800 per video. I'm really tempted to take a look at this.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:31.760]   This looks great. You might want to use it with Descript. Do the Descript first and then upload
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:37.040]   to Glinger. I don't know. This is interesting. I like that it takes out disfluencies. I got plenty
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:44.640]   of those. It's pretty great. Nice. Thank you, Stephen. I switched to all Brandon. I have that
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:52.160]   very much. Andy and I go big of the week. Apple has finally a whole bunch of new games in Apple
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:57.680]   Arcade right now. My favorite right now is what the car by the same studio, as you might imagine,
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:02.400]   that did what the golf and you think, Oh, car. So it is a driving game. Yes, it is a driving game
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:07.040]   in the same way that what the golf is a golfing game. It is first, it is a car tuning. Oh, look
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:11.200]   fun. It's like you're driving in this little mountain pass with bears like cheering you on and
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:17.200]   holding up signs. And then like instead of a car, the car has like legs for wheels, which changes
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:21.520]   like how it handles the second time you run it. And then they're all about way too many legs.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:25.520]   And now it's got way too many legs and it's harder and it's different way it goes. And then
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:30.640]   like the next love, it's not even really levels. It's more like you're playing different versions of
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:36.560]   we're very, very weird and increasingly drunk and demented driving game by the fourth
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:43.520]   version that took me through was there are two I think either beavers or bears standing on each
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.320]   side of the car wearing like traffic cones as hats. They're just carrying your car through the
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:54.720]   through the course. It's like, I keep screwing up because like oftentimes I'm just laughing at
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:00.400]   like what it is chosen to make me do with this car. It is the absolute opposite of thank goodness of
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:06.640]   what I see in most racing games, which is like you do one lap and you're really wonderful F1 car.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.440]   And then it's the hey, congratulations. That was a great lap. Now here you what you want to
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:14.880]   upgrade the brakes. Maybe you want to go through the transmission of the differential? Like, no,
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:20.640]   no, no, just let me drive another. Let me have fun driving this fake car through this fake area
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.880]   and forget the burden of mortal existence and then unforgiving and uninterested God for just 10
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:31.120]   minutes, please. And this actually absolutely does that. I loved what the golf. So I will be
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.440]   playing this. That was it was just creative and very early arcade hit big hit for a couple.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:39.680]   Yeah. And I actually still pay for Apple. Okay, because I'm doing an Apple and even though I
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:45.440]   wear it, I know I'm going to use it. So I go ahead, I'll be I'll be a download net when we're done.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:50.000]   I am downloading a new game from the folks at Niantic, you know, they created Pokemon Go.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:58.480]   And today released a game called Paradot, or is it peridot? It is a virtual AR pet.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:07.840]   iOS and Android. In fact, let me my pet is named Pookie. Let me just let me just launch Pookie here.
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:13.520]   And I will just show you there's Pookie. Hey, Pookie. And I can I can scratch her and she's
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.160]   purring. You probably can't tell it, but she's purring. And we can play a game. I will I will
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:23.360]   play fetch with Pookie here. Let me just throw that ball, Pookie. She's running off. She's getting
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:29.200]   the ball. She's going to come right back and come back. Hi, Pookie. Good girl. What a she's happy.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:37.680]   She likes to play. There we go. You feed the pet. You. Oh, where did she go? She's lost her.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:44.080]   I've been there. Oh, there she is. Oh, you can't lose her. I could put that away. I can I can do
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:50.320]   other. I will eventually get other toys. I have to feed her. She's a Tamagotchi. Actually,
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.520]   they showed it already on iOS today. So if you want to see more gameplay with Rosemary,
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.360]   where is she? Oh, she's over there. Oh, the tennis ball's about to break. Where'd she go? Where'd she
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:07.040]   go? This is it's, you know, it's well done. It's a game. It's an AR game. Kind of like Pookie
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:12.480]   Mongo. It's pretty well done. Kind of fun. She'll bug me. She's going to sleep right now.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:18.800]   But one interesting thing, and I bet you they talked about this already on iOS today,
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:25.360]   what's that? What does she want that? What is that? You can buy stuff. Of course, right? That's
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:31.920]   where the money is because the game's free. I'll use use the location stuff. You can buy stuff,
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:37.440]   and you can get real stuff delivered by Amazon. This is the first deal Amazon has made
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:48.880]   with a virtual game to order real stuff like t-shirts and things. So it's a new business
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:54.960]   for Amazon. It's kind of interesting. It's called Peridot. It's free to play, although
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.760]   I'm guessing they're going to kind of be pushing you to buy stuff in there. I think
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:05.440]   Niantic does really, really good stuff. It's the first Amazon anywhere a game as well. So
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:16.320]   you'll be able to get Peridot icon t-shirts and pillows and pop sockets to let the world know
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:23.920]   you're in the Peridot Keeper Society for real money with real shipping because it's real
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:29.280]   merchandise. Interesting Amazon. Mr. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.600]   I thought I'd recommended this one before, but I went through the Macbook picks and couldn't find
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:39.120]   it. So I felt like it was worth talking about. I use a lot of plugins from Isotope.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:45.760]   And this is kind of a secret weapon that I was talking. The reason I thought about
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:50.800]   talking about today is I was talking to one of my producers yesterday. And I was like,
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.640]   well, I was having some trouble getting the license to work. I had changed computers and
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:58.400]   everything else. And it took me a couple minutes. And I can't really operate without it.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:04.800]   So when you go into logic, these are all plugins that are Isotopes. They have RX and Ozone. And
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:10.880]   you have D-verb. So if someone's got too much reverberation in their room, you can take that
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:18.080]   out. D, S, D, Plosive, D. You're mostly taking things away to make those work. And they've
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:23.840]   a lot of different bundles. I paid $20 a month. It is a subscription that I paid for. I don't
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.320]   know what it would cost a lot of money if it wasn't that way. But it's a $20 a month subscription.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:31.440]   And I have to admit, I was trying to figure out which one I had. I don't know which one I have.
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:35.920]   In there. So that's why I just said Isotope. Just check it out. But there's ones for vocal
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:43.200]   and for music and for a variety of other ones. And you get these big bundle of tools. And again,
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:47.600]   the ones that I use mostly are someone talks a little bit into their mic and you take it out.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:53.600]   And someone talks a little bit and it really does a good job. And everybody I know that does
[01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:00.000]   much audio work has it. It's just kind of like everybody. You're just like, well, then I use
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:06.160]   RSA. What does this dialogue match do? That's interesting. It is designed. I haven't used it
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:09.520]   that much because I don't worry about it that much. But if you're trying to, if you have two
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.440]   dialogues from the same person or if you have, I think it's also if you have two different people.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:17.760]   Like maybe if you're overdubbing the same room, you want to change the word.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:20.400]   Yeah. You want the tonal quality to be the same.
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:25.040]   I have, you know, they have one called Nectar, which is supposed to kind of like analyze and
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:30.000]   put in the plugins. And I haven't been as excited about that. But the D-verb,
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:35.840]   D-plosive, D-S is almost guaranteed. If I start doing much work, I'm going to put some of those
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:42.160]   in if there's any of those issues that are there for my capacity show or other things that I work
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:48.240]   on with audio. You're doing a lot of audio these days. Yeah. I-Z-O-T-O-P-E-I-Zo-Tope.
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:53.840]   Like an I-Zope with a Z. Oh, you use it to Steven? I'd say yeah. I use the RX10
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:59.600]   suite from Iza-Tope. And I use it for exactly one tool all the time, which is the breath remover.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:06.560]   I breathe kind of loud. And so I just run my wave file to remove all the breaths. And it's amazing.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:10.320]   And then I'll take that audio and bring it into final cut. But all the tools are amazing, but
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:13.440]   breath remover. Yeah. It's really good.
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:20.400]   Yeah. I don't know what you're talking about. God, you're giving me flashpacks. I used to
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:26.000]   do a podcast with someone who had a headset and they would keep the microphone positioned
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.200]   right underneath a nostril. And I'm like, I'm not kidding. I had to quit this podcast after
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.560]   like a month because he would not stop doing it. And I've just- You have to run this episode
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:40.560]   through Iza-Tope back a little. Force is strong in this one. All right.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:49.200]   Izo-Tope. Continue our dive, exploring the go-through the kind of play of life at the Great Barrier
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:54.240]   Reef continues to withstand us. Jack is so busy. He's continued to flourish.
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:02:00.240]   I thought it was Steve Zisou at first, but no, it's John Life's Comes From The Water.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.360]   Thank you, Andy and I go, when are you going to be on GBH? Next, my friend.
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:10.480]   I am on this Thursday at 1230 in the afternoon, Eastern time go to
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:14.720]   www.bghnews.org to stream it live or later. I'm also going to be on, if you're in Chicago,
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:21.120]   I'm going to be on WGN next Tuesday at 730 to about eight. Also talking about hopefully different
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:22.960]   tech news, but there'll be lots to talk about. Nice.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:31.200]   Stephen Robles, the bearded teacher is at beard.fm. All his stuff is there, his bio, his blog, his
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:40.000]   podcasts, his YouTube series for learners. He does a lot of stuff, but if you just go to beard.fm,
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.760]   you'll find it all there. Stephen, we love it when you're on. Thank you for coming by. We really
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:51.120]   appreciate it. Thanks for having me. It's an honor. Yeah. Oh, it's an honor and a privilege and a
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:59.280]   pleasure to have you on. Alex Lindsey, officehours.global, every day of the week. There's something
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:03.840]   interesting happening there and it's free and everybody can visit and watch it on YouTube or
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:09.600]   even join the Zoom. What did you do to this week? Well, yesterday we had Michael Krasney
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:16.480]   on talking about how to interview. Oh, I got to watch that. Wow. What an hour. It was really
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:20.640]   amazing. We have a lot of good second hours and usually every week we have a lot of good ones here,
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:27.600]   but he was in the zone and we had folks ask a great questions and we just really dug into the
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.280]   process of interviews. If you're thinking about that at all, I mean, he's really talking about
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.400]   how he approaches it and what he thinks about and how he puts it together and it was a masterclass.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.040]   Nice. Nice. So we're really excited about that. Yeah. So I would definitely check it out.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.200]   And of course, lots more. You can join the Zoom and ask questions or just watch after the fact.
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:55.440]   Find out more at officehours.global. If you want to hire Alex, you can go to his day job 090.media.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:01.760]   He's back home. It's nice to see you in your home studio. What's the name? Yeah. Absolutely.
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:08.080]   A reminder to our club, Twit members, we've got a big AMA coming up this week on Thursday
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:15.440]   with Alex Wilhelm. You've seen Alex on many of our shows. He's kind of a finance expert, but he's
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:20.320]   also a great friend and a wonderful guy and lives in my childhood home. You can ask him about that
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:28.640]   as well. Alex Wilhelm's AMA from my childhood home will be at 9am Pacific this Thursday.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:34.720]   Home theater geeks is also every Thursday in the afternoon at 1pm Pacific. Sean Powers will be the
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.480]   guest in a fireside chat next month. Stacey Higginbotham's new book from Annalie Newitz,
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:47.760]   The Terra Formers. That'll be the book of the month for our Stacey's book club. And then on July 14th,
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:53.280]   it's time to get drunk with everybody from Twit. Twit after hours. We've never done this,
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.960]   but we're going to sit around drink Brown liquor and you're going to find out the true story.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:00.640]   I wouldn't say we're all trying to get drunk. Oh, come on.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:07.120]   You know, with the approval hosting it, there'll be a significant amount of consumption.
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:13.040]   Rod Piled is a fireside chat too. All of that is part of your membership, not the entirety of
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:16.400]   your membership at all. In fact, when we created Club Twit, we thought the whole thing would be
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.880]   about ad-free versions. You can add free versions of all of our shows, no ads, no tracking,
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:26.800]   just privacy. And it takes about an hour out of every show. So it's not that much, but it's,
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:32.240]   you know, it's faster and you don't even hear this. You also get access to the Club Twit Discord,
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:39.360]   which is full of great stuff, not just those events, but wonderful chatting about all kinds of
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:47.200]   subjects, not just the shows, but even geek topics like, well, you know, alcoholic content.
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:54.160]   There's also gaming and cooking and food and all sorts of stuff, plus the Twit Plus feed with shows.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:58.880]   Quite a few now that we don't put out in public, we only put out for Club Twit members,
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:05.440]   hands-on Macintosh with micro-surgeon hands-on windows with Paul Therat, the untitled Linux show,
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:12.880]   with Jonathan Bennett and company. The Gizfiz was Dick D. Bartolo, Stacy's book club and all that.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:18.160]   And we use it to launch shows. The latest, of course, that's where this week in space started.
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:22.880]   The latest show is Scott Wilkinson's back with Home Theater Geeks, club only for now,
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:28.080]   but we're hoping that we can launch it into public. The reason we can do this is because you
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:33.200]   support us with $7 a month. It keeps the lights on, keeps the staff employed, and it keeps us
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:38.720]   producing new content. So I think $7 a month, very fair. Go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:46.400]   There's also family plans, yearly plans, and corporate plans. Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:54.720]   We do this show every, let me think, Tuesday, right? Yeah, I think so. Tuesday, 2 p.m.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:03.920]   No, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern. That would be 1800 UTC. I mentioned live because you can watch
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:08.800]   us or listen to us live at live.twit.tv. There's audio and video streams there. If you're watching
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:12.720]   our listening live, you can, of course, chat in our Discord if you're a club twit member or
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:18.720]   in our IRC for everyone at IRC.twit.tv. After the fact, add supported versions of the show
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:24.560]   and are at the website. Twit.tv/mbw. There's a YouTube channel. You'll see a link at the website
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:30.320]   there for that. There's also, of course, your favorite podcast player to subscribe in whatever
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:34.080]   app you use, and you should be able to listen the minute it's available or watch we have video
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:41.200]   versions to on a Tuesday afternoon. Thank you, everybody, for being here. Thank you,
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:47.200]   Steven. It's great to see you. Andy Inaco, thank you, Alex Lindsay. Thanks to all of you for joining
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:53.360]   us, but now I have some bad news. It's time to get back to work because Breaktime is over.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:08:00.880]   But, like, hey there, Scott Wilkinson here. In case you hadn't heard, Home Theater Geeks is back.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:07.680]   Each week, I bring you the latest audio video news, tips and tricks to get the most out of your AV
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:14.640]   system, product reviews, and more. You can enjoy Home Theater Geeks only if you're a member of
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:21.360]   Club Twit, which costs $7 a month, or you can subscribe to Home Theater Geeks by itself for only
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:27.280]   $2.99 a month. I hope you'll join me for a weekly dose of Home Theater Geeks.
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:38.800]   Take care.
