[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Renee.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.600]   Andy, Lori, they're all here.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200]   We'll talk about the 10 cent fewer,
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800]   and how to stop sending your information overseas.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200]   Of course, we're going to talk a little bit
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.480]   about the new Pixel 4 phone.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.680]   Google announced it this morning.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.960]   Andy's got his hands on it.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.000]   We'll talk about that.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.720]   Catalina has problems.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.920]   You've heard iOS 13, too.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.800]   There are updates.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.120]   We'll tell you what to expect.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.960]   Oh, and a look at Apple TV Plus on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.920]   news from Apple.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.360]   Of course, all the news this week is from Google.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.680]   But that's OK.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.760]   That's OK.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.720]   Renee Ritchie is here from iMore and Vector,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.520]   the wonderful video podcast at iMore.com/vector.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.040]   And you're looking--
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.480]   You look marvelous.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.160]   Did you get some sort of cinema camera now?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.360]   Are you doing--
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480]   I have this weird distortion happening through Skype,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   but I'm going to lean into it.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.040]   Leo, I like it.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   I like it.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   I'm like it.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   I like it.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.120]   And I'm happy to talk Google News,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.840]   because they cut the event so short.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.800]   I don't know what happened.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.040]   I mean, well, I was playing it.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.800]   Good news, because Andy Ennaco was there.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.440]   In fact--
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.000]   I was there.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.640]   He's got a Pixel 4 in his hot little hands.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.080]   I'm going to pick the 4.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   WGBH Boston.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.680]   WGBH Boston.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.520]   Look, I'm looking at it, and it's unlocking automatically.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.040]   Wow.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.560]   I'm squeezing the sides and it's acting--
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.440]   If you're an Apple fanboy that resents any mention
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.360]   of Android or Google, this may not be the show for you.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.920]   But we'll get-- there's Apple stuff.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.280]   Don't worry.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.480]   Loya, you'll take care of that.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.640]   She's, of course, from iMore as well managing editor.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.760]   Hi, Laurie.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.040]   Hi.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.600]   How's it going?
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.320]   Great.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.040]   Good to have you.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.960]   I love that thing holding your laptop.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.320]   What is--
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.960]   That's the--
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.320]   is it called the ARK book?
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.280]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.960]   It's a laptop stand.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.880]   It's the 12 South.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.520]   It's the 12 South.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.600]   Oh, of course it is.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   It's pretty great.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.520]   Actually, I'm testing out a standing desk.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.320]   That's why that's behind me instead of not being behind me.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.360]   No, I like it.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   I like it.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.920]   Also means--
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.400]   Can I also--
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160]   Can I show off my shirt real quick?
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.880]   I think everybody will appreciate.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   They are--
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   Hey.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.280]   It's the angry goose version of Taco Bell called Take Bell.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.840]   I love it.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   They're kind of available anymore.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.480]   I'm titled Goose shirt.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.040]   I'm titled Goose shirt.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920]   Where did you get it?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.640]   It was Teespring, but they're not available anymore.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   So it's not my pick this week.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.680]   Otherwise, I would definitely be telling everyone about it.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.800]   People sasser probably walked over there and gave them what's for.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.680]   That is the best--
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.640]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.720]   I got in before they got put down.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.960]   And the best part of it is that most people will see it and not
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.720]   and go, OK, they won't even think about it.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.080]   I think I'm going to Taco Bell shirt.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.240]   But honestly, that may be the best T-shirt I've ever seen.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.760]   Yes.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.800]   It's so funny.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.320]   Oh, my god.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.120]   So good.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.560]   I love it.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.160]   There are-- I'm looking on Teespring.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.840]   There are quite a few goose shirts
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.960]   because that untitled goose game is very popular.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.640]   But these are not as good.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.680]   Honestly, these are not as good as yours.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   Wow.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.840]   I'm so jealous.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   And I'm sorry.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.640]   That's why, again, I wouldn't have even brought it up,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.360]   except for that you can't buy one.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.720]   So I have to show off what I'm--
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.560]   Man.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   You're making me jealous.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   Right.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's better than you.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.080]   Annie's making me jealous.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.160]   I'm not sure if I'm more jealous of Annie or you.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.280]   I think I'm more jealous of you.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.040]   Not pretty sure.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.160]   That pixel phone is a little better than a T-shirt.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.280]   Untitled pixel phones.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.280]   But the difference is that you can go out and buy
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.960]   one of these.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.680]   You can't go out and buy one of them.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.240]   See, if I gave you-- if I traded this to you for that shirt,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.760]   then I would have the shirt.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.800]   And I would have the phone again in a couple of weeks
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.200]   after I paid for it.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.720]   But--
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.960]   Well, actually, it's too peaceful.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   And so I couldn't trade.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   Still.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.040]   I guess I win today.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.800]   So let's all just--
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.040]   I would understand it out of our system.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   Hawk.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   Hawk.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.360]   Hawk.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.520]   OK, done.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.640]   We're talking about this game.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.720]   If you don't know about it, you're not hip with the kids.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.080]   It's the untitled goose game from Epic.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.400]   And pretty amazing.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.640]   I want to do the $0.10 thing.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.720]   And then we will talk a little bit about the Google event.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.400]   This is an important story.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.880]   And you did a great job Renee Richie.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.400]   So you get coverage on this.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.120]   We talked about it Sunday on this week in Tech.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.640]   It had come out that day that since iOS 12,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.480]   Apple has changed the privacy agreement
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.320]   in Safari to say, in safe browsing, you're--
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.560]   well, they don't say anonymized.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.680]   But it is anonymized, it turns out.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.920]   But you're browsing information.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.080]   And some of the information about you
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   may be sent to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent Safe Browsing.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.280]   For a long time, it's been sent to Google Safe Browsing.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.640]   What the Google API does is somewhat anonymizes you.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.960]   Apple just sends Google a hash of the website
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.760]   that you're going to.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.880]   And if Google sees that as a fraudulent or malicious website,
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.000]   it'll go back to Apple, say, what's the actual website?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.200]   And then once it gets the actual website, it'll say, yes,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.280]   that's fraudulent.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.320]   And during that process, Google and Apple
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.760]   both say your information is anonymous.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.960]   But without any warning or telling anybody,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.480]   they added this Tencent piece that
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.840]   doesn't say anything except that it might be sent to Google
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.960]   and Tencent, of course, is a Chinese company, Mainland
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.680]   Chinese company.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.400]   It owns Riot Games.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.480]   They're the ones who have shut down
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.960]   any mention of Hong Kong in--
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.480]   They own massive amounts of movies,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.080]   they own a ton of percentages of US companies at this point.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.280]   They're the ones pressuring Tencent is pressuring Blizzard
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.800]   and other people to say, ex nay on Hong Kong.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.160]   I think they own part of Reddit.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.720]   And they own a lot of percentages of a lot of big movies
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.520]   that are coming out.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.720]   They used to be a game company.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.800]   Now they're really just an investment company at a Mainland
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.080]   China.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.880]   But you went and asked Apple about this.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.760]   And I'm glad you did because they clarified.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.280]   They should have, by the way, still bad on Apple.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.880]   They should have told everybody what they were up to
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.000]   and what it meant.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.360]   We had that you had to go ask them.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   What did they tell you?
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.680]   So it's long story short, which is hard in the situation.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.720]   But Google works for most of the world.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.920]   But Google effectively doesn't exist in China.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.320]   And that's a whole other story to get into.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.360]   So what Apple is doing to provide the same malicious website,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.320]   fraudulent website detection in China,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.400]   is partnering with Tencent.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.000]   They maintain a very similar list to what Google maintains.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.560]   Only they do it for websites that are located in China.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.520]   In a perfect world, Apple would have their own list,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.280]   or DuckDuckGo would have a list.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.840]   But they don't.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.760]   So they outsource that to Google outside, everywhere
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.400]   outside of China and Tencent inside Mainline China.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.600]   And my understanding is they use a very similar technology
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.000]   in that they give hash prefixes to the sites that you're
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.880]   going to, which creates a pool of sites.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.080]   It's not totally anonymous.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.880]   It's not specific, though.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.960]   It's out of this vast pool of websites,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.600]   this user is going to one of them.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.880]   And if it gets a response from that,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.280]   then it provides the website address so that it can check
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.120]   precisely for which website it is.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.040]   Now, it does get IP information, and it does get that prefix
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.720]   up front.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.200]   It only gets the actual website if it's a fraudulent
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.800]   or malicious website.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   And then that comes back in Safari, parses all that.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.480]   Up until that point, all of that is on device.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.360]   It's only if it's actually a fraudulent website
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.120]   that that transmission occurs.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.520]   You can opt out of it by turning off fraudulent website
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.800]   protection, a malicious website protection.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.360]   That does mean that you will encounter potentially
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.240]   malicious websites.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.320]   Although have you ever--
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.840]   I've never been--
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.520]   I had this warning, ever.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   I've had it many times.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.560]   But it was usually erroneous.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.840]   I found it was either one of our sites or another tech
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.240]   site that for some reason had been flagged erroneously
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.720]   by the system.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.440]   That's interesting.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.640]   I think-- well, I'm going to turn it off.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.200]   Now, they were very clear.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.600]   It only sends it to $10 cent if you're in mainland China,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.440]   if you're region and coding.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.480]   And your region is set to mainland China, yeah.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.680]   However, honestly, I don't even like the idea of it being
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.000]   sent to Google.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.440]   Matthew Green, the cryptographer from Johns Hopkins,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.000]   said, you know, it's what we call K anonymity.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.160]   It is perhaps not a perfect system.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   And I don't know if it really is that important for your safety.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.920]   So obviously, we'll leave that up to you.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.960]   And also, Apple's not proxying it.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.840]   Because, for example, with Siri, they don't see who's
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.480]   making their request.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.280]   They see Apple making their request on behalf of Siri.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   And with a login with Apple, they
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.640]   create artificial anonymized relays.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.320]   So there's probably a lot of room in the system
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.520]   to make it even more anonymous if it is something that Apple
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.440]   wants to provide.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.600]   And you believe that you're going to encounter
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.040]   those sorts of websites.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.400]   And every person has to threat model this for themselves.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.520]   If they're engaged in an activity with their belief,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.440]   for example, some groups are targeted by malicious websites
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.280]   to get malware put on their computers
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.680]   by various nations, by various groups.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.920]   So if it's something that you think it's likely to happen
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.880]   to you, you've got to do that threat model.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.880]   This is-- you go into settings.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.040]   This is, by the way, on all safaris, iOS and desktop, right?
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.680]   If you go into the settings, you go to Safari.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.880]   You'll have to scroll down a bit.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.280]   It's kind of down towards the bottom.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.520]   It's in the security and privacy and security settings.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.040]   Fraudulent website warning.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.400]   If you tap-- this is the thing that got people's concern.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.760]   If you tap the privacy settings, it
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.200]   says Safari may send information calculated
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.740]   from the website address to Google Safe Browsing and Ten
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.840]   Sense Safe Browsing to check if the website is fraudulent.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.800]   These safe browsing providers may also log your IP address.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.560]   It doesn't say, Ten Sense Only if you're in China.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.600]   I imagine Apple will make that change at some point.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.000]   But at the same time, even Google,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.400]   maybe you don't want to send your IP address to Google.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.120]   Because that's for every site, not the fraudulent sites.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's only if the prefix matches.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Only if the hash tag matches.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.480]   Does that information get translated?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:13.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.920]   I don't know why Google needs your IP address.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.520]   Well, it doesn't that it's needed.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.200]   So Safari does all this processing on device.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.840]   But then in order to check the list,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.200]   it sends it from your device.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.000]   And because it's being sent from your device,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.560]   they get the IP address.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.840]   Ironically, somebody in the chatroom, Eric Duckman,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.480]   says it's been there since iOS 12, and we just noticed.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.080]   That just shows you how much we read these things.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.280]   Because of the China thing, people started looking.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.200]   They're kind of aware.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.760]   It raises awareness, and then everything starts to be checked.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.320]   So it apparently is the same API Google uses for its Safe
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.560]   browsing, $0.10 using.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.280]   So again, KNN and an M&E, it's not perfect,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.920]   but it's better than just sending everything over.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.520]   You wouldn't leave it up to you, whether.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.080]   But I don't think it's the tempest and teapot.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.160]   In fact, I said on Sunday before Apple's statement,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.400]   I said, this is going to be telling to see what Apple does
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.640]   about this and what Apple says about it.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.200]   I knew that they would respond as soon as this became public.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.720]   But I wish they had said so upfront.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.360]   And I don't understand why they didn't.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.840]   Or explain the process, because if people don't see the process,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.600]   it's not transparent.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.880]   They can't understand it.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.840]   And then everything-- like, justifiably,
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840]   everything looks scary.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.880]   Well, you called it FUD.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.600]   I don't think it's FUD.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.960]   I think it's justifiably concerning.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.920]   If Apple doesn't--
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.880]   I don't think it's FUD at all.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.080]   I think certain reporting was very funny on it initially.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.400]   Like, it was-- people panicked in light
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.960]   of all the other China stuff going on,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.240]   and sort of lumped it in through it together,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   rather than breaking it down and seeing what was actually
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.160]   happening.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.320]   I don't use Safari.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.560]   I use Firefox.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.760]   I turn off all tracking.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.480]   I turn off all of the Google and Facebook and Twitter
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.440]   bugs and all of that stuff, because I don't want everything
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.920]   I do sent back to anybody.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.800]   I don't think anybody needs that information.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.280]   So I leave that up to you.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.080]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.320]   Living dangerously, I guess.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.520]   All right.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.560]   I'm sure there's other Apple stuff to talk about.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.720]   And I'm sure we will get to the other Apple stuff.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.160]   But I guess we really ought to.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.960]   I haven't had a chance yet to talk to anybody
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.800]   about the Google event.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.960]   This morning, at 7 o'clock, 10 AM Eastern time, Google
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.480]   announced it's all it's made by Google 2019 stuff.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.640]   Some stuff won't be available till next year, particularly
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.320]   those Google-- the new Google Earbuds.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.200]   But they look a lot more like AirPods now,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.280]   and they don't have a wire joining them together.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.080]   And they're kind of like AirPods going to be Siri connected.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.360]   The case looks like AirPods.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.200]   The buds look--
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   The buds look a little different.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.000]   They go in your ear.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They have a little plastic--
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.960]   Not like Microsoft different, but a little--
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.600]   Yeah, they're not as big as Microsoft.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.320]   Yeah, they really are tiny.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.480]   And they don't have anything sticking out from--
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.960]   they don't have any lollipop sticks sticking out from under it.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.280]   They really snug in the ear.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.640]   So they're not even like the Bose Earbuds,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.960]   where they're in obtrusive.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.160]   But you can see this sort of bulgey, sticky outy hemisphere
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.880]   sticking out.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.440]   It really does almost seem like you're wearing your plugs,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.960]   more than anything else.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.880]   And it does have a--
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.720]   And it has a silicon shroud around the insert,
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.280]   as opposed to just shut out a little bit of the noise
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.840]   from the outside and also enhanced base.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.160]   But the really cool thing about it
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.880]   is that-- and remember, we're not seeing this until next year,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.680]   early next year.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.840]   The really cool thing about it is
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.520]   that they're saying that it doesn't--
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.880]   you can use it up to three rooms away from your phone.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.440]   And so the idea of just walking around your house
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.520]   and having access to a verbal assistant
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.880]   and getting information and triggering things
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   just by walking around, that's pretty darn cool.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.080]   Let's see how well it works.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.040]   But that's the idea that you don't have to have this thing
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.240]   as just simply Bluetooth earphones that do things
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.200]   through your phone.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.320]   That's just keep one of them tucked into your ear,
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.520]   because you know you're going to be doing things all over the office
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.640]   or all over the house.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.000]   And you still want to have access to the sort of tools
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.800]   that let you do things without having to find your phone,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.680]   pick it up, unlock it, and do stuff.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.000]   That's intriguing.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.320]   We should talk about the phone, because Dieter Bone and the Verge
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   said it's the hipster iPhone 11.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.360]   It really looks a lot like an iPhone 11, that camera bump,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.000]   the square camera bump, has face ID no longer,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.160]   no fingerprint reader.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.080]   If I weren't looking closely, Andy,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.520]   I might think you had an iPhone 11.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.840]   There is no notch, though.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.520]   There is no notch.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.400]   I guess people are calling it the forehead.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.560]   But because it has so many sensors for these radars
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.480]   that's got in, in addition to the cameras and the projectors
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.400]   that they need for face unlocking,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.080]   it's not, I mean, as usual, you're going to have the same people
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.760]   who are vomiting over the iPhone notch
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.160]   and are vomiting over the forehead
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.120]   are also saying they're vomiting over the bump on the back here.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.400]   But again, I remain vomit-free at this point.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.760]   Google said it's the--
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.240]   Can't have a whole punch either.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.520]   Google says the first phone to have radar.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.280]   This is the solely technology Google
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.760]   announced a couple of years ago.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   And Google showed this on stage that the original sensor
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.680]   was the size of a paperback book.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.160]   They've got it shrunk down now, so it actually fits in that forehead.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.560]   How is radar different from what Apple's doing?
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.800]   What it does is it's able to create really a 3D map of things
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.440]   that are around you without having to do it with cameras.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.160]   So it's a lot lower power.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.760]   Privacy is a lot better because it's not taking any pictures.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.760]   And the granularity of what it can do is pretty impressive.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.400]   The only things that they have rolling out the door
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.520]   for the initial Pixel 4 are simple things
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.200]   like hold your hand over to silence something.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.440]   They have, like in the alarm app.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.080]   As soon as you reach for it, it senses that your hand is going
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.000]   for the phone.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.440]   And then it will, like, it won't turn off the alarm,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.000]   but it'll make it quieter because it knows
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.360]   that OKA human is trying to interact with it right now.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.600]   And then you could use your hand to sort of stop it.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.720]   You can go forward and backward through tracks
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.400]   when you listen to music with it.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.480]   But they also showed off--
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.640]   Don't bury the lead, Andy.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.760]   Tickle me Pikachu.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.680]   That's the lead.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.240]   You know what?
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.840]   They showed that, which I guess was a lock screen.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.600]   And then you're kind of going like this, waving it back and forth.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.720]   It was going, yay!
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.240]   I thought of you, Renee, immediately.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.800]   They're not totally burying the lead here.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.280]   I did tickle a Pikachu in the demo area.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.360]   So it's less do you think that, oh, great.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   There's an inference sensor here and here.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.840]   It just senses that something is blocking one than the other.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.000]   No, you can also, in this game, you have the Pokemon.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.280]   You can actually, like, scratch it like this.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.000]   And it'll respond to it.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.080]   Is that a game, then?
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.760]   It's a game.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.280]   It's a game.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.080]   I didn't play it, play it.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.240]   But it's an interactive game.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.440]   The sensor itself is really good at discriminating individual touch.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.280]   You'll remember that when they first showed this off a couple of years ago, they're talking
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.000]   about doing things like controls where, how about you change the volume just by going
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.200]   like this, like you're twisting a knob with your fingertips.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.000]   And it could even do things like, again, according to research papers based on this
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.480]   that I've read before, things like, well, what if you just, if I'm at a diner and just
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.320]   listening to music, what if I just like take one of the salt shakers and put it in front
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.320]   of the phone?
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:35.480]   Now, that salt shaker is now my tuning knob or my volume knob, just because it can recognize
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.840]   that, oh, there's something that's spinning in three dimensions with appropriate hand gestures.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.720]   There's a lot they could do with it.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:48.560]   They are clearly, and when they first formally announced it early this year as part of the
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.960]   Pixel 4 suite of features, they did mention the specific features they're putting in
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.000]   at launch, but also saying that, of course, we're going to be building upon this in the
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   future.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.720]   Hopefully, that will pay out because this could be, this is a really, really interesting innovation
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   in controlling a phone.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.760]   Just how, I mean, just how, like, if you have the, if the weights integrate into different
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.440]   features like the face unlock, it won't, it doesn't, it's not always scanning to see
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.920]   if your face is there.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.200]   However, if it senses, if you've got this lying, it's locked and it's on a table, if
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.240]   you reach for it, as soon as you reach for it senses, oh, there's a hand above it, I
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.320]   bet the user's about to pick it up, so then it starts turning on the sensors for the
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.120]   face unlock, so that, that, and by the time you've actually lifted it up, now it's actually
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.800]   unlocked the phone and stuff like that.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.640]   So it's interesting to see how, let's tune back in a year from now to see how well they're
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.520]   supporting it and how well it actually integrates everything else.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.720]   I got the impression that they are starting simply with gestures, but that there is a
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.520]   lot more that they, they think they could do with it.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.040]   It could be like Daredevil, right, like Radar Sense.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:00.280]   I absolutely think that it's, it's kind of, I kind of feel like it's like when Apple
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.120]   introduced the first Macintosh and they decided specifically to go with a one button mouse
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.360]   because we don't want to overload people's imagination.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.840]   People who are using this for the first time, let's just give them one simple gesture, one
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.960]   simple action, and then maybe later on we'll figure out how to make things a little bit
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.840]   more complex because it is, I mean, already you have to sort of get used to the idea of
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.200]   I can interact with this phone without actually touching it.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.840]   All I have to do is, you know, you're getting sleepy, sleepy, and just moving your hands
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.000]   in front of it.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.840]   I mean, it's, it's, it's almost disappointing when you find out that, oh, well, what if
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.240]   I, can I just like scroll through a web browser page by doing that?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   Well, no.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.720]   It's like, oh, well, why do I bother even trying this at all?
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.560]   You don't want it to become like 3D touch where it's really nifty, but because it's
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.480]   not universal and it's not obviously something you have to press.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.640]   People are just going to forget to try to use.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.920]   Samsung had something similar several generations ago and it, you know, it didn't.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.280]   They don't still do it.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   They got 21 minutes to fill during the keynote presentation.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.000]   So whatever engineer come up with something that will demo very nicely that people will
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   show their friends.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Do you remember LG though?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.480]   From last year, that was the worst.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.600]   It was like, you're like, trying to use force powers to make the.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.800]   What about the face recognition because reviewers have already said it's surprisingly quick,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.400]   faster than apples.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.120]   What's your experience, Andy?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.400]   I would say it's faster than apples because it's, it's, the only thing I would compare
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.600]   it to is like when you've got your Apple Watch set to unlock your, unlock your MacBook.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.200]   Like by the time you're about to key in your, your, your password, it's already unlocked.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.320]   Before you figure out that I've done, I've, I've done too much work.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.920]   It's actually already done it for me.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.720]   Again, you're talking to a person who in terms of having this set up has had exactly like
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.920]   43 minutes worth of experience with it.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   But I'm picking it up.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.800]   I'm noticing that it's unlocking itself.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.680]   It's not just simply, it's not just simply, oh, it just didn't relock itself.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.440]   It's no, it's actually doing the scan.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.480]   It does the, it has a little user interface sort of thing where it actually puts like a
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.360]   little halo around like the edge.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.760]   It's kind of hard to see, depending on how you, how you use it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.920]   It seems right now to be very, very fast, very, very reliable so far.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:21.080]   The face mapping is not quite as cool as the way that Apple does it, the way you train
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.960]   it to, to teach your new face.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.440]   But it's working very well so far.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.760]   Again, with the caveat, I've had less than an hour of actual like day to day experience
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   with this.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.800]   But I'm like, I really like is that they, you can turn off the lock screen because I
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.840]   go with Apple, whether you want it or not, it's going to stop you with the lock screens.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.960]   You got to do that extra swipe gesture and some people could care less about the lock
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.280]   screen and it makes it feel slow to them because my phone's unlocked, but now I have
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.400]   to do this whole gesture and I can't get into it.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   I agree.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.800]   And if you would just give them the same setting, I think face ID would feel so much faster.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.360]   I mean, the, the issue is, and actually Dieter Bono dresses this in his Verge report too,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.280]   some people feel like because it's so quick and because it can do it before you even pick
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.920]   it up, maybe this was never locked.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.560]   And so that's why they give you the choice because some people actually are made uncomfortable
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560]   by that.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.400]   Some people lock screen notifications, they want to see those just because they don't
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   want to do their phone.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.720]   They just want to see quickly if they need to or not.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.800]   So I do, I, you know, I think I'll be like you, I'll turn off the lock screen, but maybe
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.000]   not, you know, you got to, you got to try and see.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.480]   I will say it's definitely not a gimmick.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.280]   It's that they haven't Samsung this feature.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.680]   They really put a lot of work into it.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.120]   And again, solely the idea of having this, this radar zone, this radar array built into
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   it.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   It's really interesting.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.000]   I haven't, I haven't, I bought a Pixel 1 back when the Pixel 2 was coming out and the
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.720]   I can get a Pixel 1 on Woot, like really, really cheap.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.920]   And I have an upgrade, didn't upgrade to the 2 or the 3 because I was waiting for something
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.320]   that was a lot more significant than, oh, look, it's got a better camera or look, it's
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   a little bit faster in ways that I'm probably not going to be able to appreciate.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.440]   But this idea of not just face unlock, but also the solely, the Admitter, it makes me
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.360]   feel as though a year from now this could be a super, super intriguing phone.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.520]   But do you think it'll also be way better on head like so?
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.080]   For me, it'll be okay on the Pixel.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.400]   I think just because they're going to have to maintain compatibility, it'll always be
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   a little bit redundant.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.040]   Like you'll be able to do it in other ways.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.240]   But on devices without displays, it could be a primary control mechanism.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.720]   If you don't want to use voice, like I just walk up to my home speaker, twist my hand,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.040]   it's only the volume is changing.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:27.480]   I mean, imagine, imagine if they had a future version of the Pixel Buds that also had a
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.920]   sensor so you could just again do things like the Q-tip gesture to change volume.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.960]   And other things like this to say, please go forward, go back.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   Those are going to be gimmicky.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   Who remembers those things?
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.360]   They're hard to remember.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.280]   When you're able to walk around the house and actually get things done when you don't
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.600]   need your phone, but you occasionally need access to information you put onto your phone,
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.560]   or you occasionally want to remember certain things, those gestures, they will come in
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560]   handy.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:59.240]   Everybody has that's that Alt Shift, Alt Option Shift, whatever command thing of their favorite
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.840]   app that they know, even though it's not easy to learn because for them, it solves
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.880]   such an important problem, makes something so quick and so accessible.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.480]   And I'm really, again, I'm really excited by the idea of 3D sensing of motion to fingers
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.640]   and hands because this could be as significant as multitouch.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.560]   It could be as significant as the mouse because it's just a way it solves a problem that we
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.640]   actually have from something as even something as prosaic as it's winter.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.720]   It is 18 degrees outside with a wind chill of, oh my God, I don't want to have to pull
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   my glove off in order to read a book.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.640]   If they're smart, the first thing they're going to, the first new feature they're going
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.160]   to add is scrolling just with the air and they're going to get that before the first
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.120]   really big cold snap in like Chicago or Wisconsin or Minnesota because that will sell pixel
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120]   phones.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   Save your fingers.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.480]   All right, we're going to save the most important part, which is the camera part for
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   after the break.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:02.360]   I do want to mention they're also copying iPhone pricing that is the loaded top of the line
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.240]   pixel 4XL is a thousand bucks.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   That's with 128 gigs.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.480]   They don't have anything bigger than 128 gigs of storage.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.960]   The baseline for both the pixel 4 and the pixel 4XL is 64 gigs, which is a little surprising.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.240]   Six gigs of RAM.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.200]   But the camera is really the reason I think people would buy a pixel phone.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.600]   Although they did say, and Andy, you can confirm or disagree with this, they said display
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.360]   mates already looked at the display and gave an A plus said it's perfect.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.480]   Pretty much the same score they gave the iPhone 11.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   Is that accurate?
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.000]   They had a slide that says it got a grade of A plus.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.360]   Anytime that I see a superlative in a presentation like this, I put a big italics underlying question
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.160]   marker out it because it's hard to say, oh, it's perfect.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   Is it?
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.400]   It's whatsoever detectable by anybody.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.640]   So display mates rapidly losing their credibility in my opinion.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   It's bad.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   Like chills now.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.400]   We gave you the full tweet at it out.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.240]   I don't like it when any manufacturer pays attention to them.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.320]   Not that I have anything against them, but when you have a company that offers consulting
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.640]   and helping you find two in these devices before release and then gives you these weird non-numeric,
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.680]   like these weird non-scales for it feels like I could get an A plus if I just played
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   the game right on my face.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   It's very weird.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.080]   Andy, you got the phone in your hands.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.440]   Is it subjectively a nice screen?
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440]   It's an OLED.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   Is it very nice?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.640]   Do you notice the 90 Hertz refresh rate?
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   Because that is unique.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.720]   The only other phone that does that right now, no iPhone does it, is the one plus seven
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.880]   and they got 90 before the note did.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.160]   That would be really weird.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   It's weird.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.320]   I haven't downloaded enough like tech scrolling apps.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.840]   Again, I'm a daily Pixel One user.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.000]   I don't notice it being necessarily any snappier than what I've more fluid than what I'm used
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.800]   to before.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.080]   But they're using the same technique that Apple uses with its variable frame rate, which
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   is to say we don't want to overcook the CPU when it's not needed.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.920]   Maybe they are saving it for times when you really are just blasting through long, long
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.920]   lists.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.200]   Again, I have to say even if I'm saying something enthusiastic about this phone, less than an
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.760]   hour is worth of hand-on experience.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.400]   I didn't have that immediate, "Oh my God, this is like a whole new phone.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.120]   My life begins anew because of this wonderful scrolling."
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   It's very nice.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.280]   It's also a really nice snappy display.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.760]   So nice.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760]   That's all.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.480]   It's not A plus.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   It's got details, it's got color.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:40.520]   If you want to say it's an A plus display, I don't tend to look at histograms.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.760]   I tend to look at the actual screen itself.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.760]   It's a fine display.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.800]   It is not the latest Snapdragon.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:51.960]   It's 855, so they're not even using the fastest Qualcomm part at this point.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   They did a bunch of ram in it, so that's nice.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.160]   60 ram is a big improvement over the last year.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.760]   They don't do the same kind of optimization that does with that.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.360]   So that really actually sees the performance hit.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.360]   That performance advantage.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360]   Main thing is the camera.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.400]   I know you've only had it for an hour, but I have a feeling you've taken some pictures.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.960]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.920]   Andy Nanako has the Pixel 4.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.080]   We're talking about that.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.320]   Renee Richie watched the event, but was disappointed because they didn't go in enough detail.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.920]   Although, it was only an hour.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.360]   That's okay with me.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   I was happy.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   I got to have breakfast.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.960]   They finished it by saying we wish we had time to show you more.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.920]   It's not like Game of Thrones season 8.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.400]   It's like we offered you more episodes, but you want to go make Star Wars.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   It's fine.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.840]   If you're going to make it short, don't say you don't have enough time to show me stuff.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.880]   I will give you the time you need.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.240]   The camera guy was great though.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.920]   The older guy with the gray hair.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.240]   I thought he was really interesting.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.360]   It was wonderful to see Andy Leibovitz on stage talking about her photography.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.120]   Even though they didn't show enough of her pictures, they looked pretty good.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   Andy, you got to stare at him.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.320]   They cut away a lot.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.840]   They're gorgeous, but I think that they undermine their own argument if they're trying to say,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.240]   "Look how wonderful our camera is."
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   If you're Andy Leibovitz.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   Andy, here's a quick approach to the box.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.960]   Here's a sheet of photographic film and a pinhole.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.760]   If you're Andy Leibovitz, you've got to do it.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.240]   You've got to pull it around here.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   She's still a potato.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.960]   Yeah, she's so good.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.400]   Anyway, we'll take a little break.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.760]   And Laurie, are you all right?
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.400]   We're just going to do a little more Google stuff.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.560]   There's more Apple to talk about.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   Oh, no.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.640]   I may have not mentioned this on MacGreg Weekly, but I love Google's...
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.440]   Everything that the way they do things, it's really inclusive.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.960]   I love how they're experimenting with new things all the time.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.200]   The fact that they put a radar and a phone right now that maybe doesn't do a lot to me,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.000]   it's just them getting ready for the next time when they put an even better radar on
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   it.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.840]   They're putting the radar in all of our hands so that we can experiment with it and then
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.400]   they know what good use cases it can be for in the future.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.640]   So I'm all aboard on this stuff.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   I think it's fun.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   I think it's great.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:03.000]   I think Google and Apple do things different, but I love Google's Let's Experiment and Let's
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.640]   share our experiments with everybody.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.040]   I love the way they do that.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.520]   I actually am thrilled there's competition.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.400]   I'm glad to see AMD stepping up now to compete with Intel.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.720]   I'm glad to see Microsoft in the game again, even making phones next year.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.200]   All of this competition means we get better products.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.840]   So I'm absolutely thrilled to see all of this.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.880]   I see that Google is really trying to hit on privacy a little bit better.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.560]   They mentioned it a couple times and they're very, very short, fast presentation today.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.800]   I felt the same way it happened so fast that by the time I was starting to understand what
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.760]   we were talking about, they'd moved on to something else.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.160]   So I felt the same way was like there was too much stuff crammed into too short period
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.920]   of time and things that they should have lingered on more like the privacy methods that they're
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.280]   kind of starting with.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.000]   There was not enough information about that.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.040]   I want to know more about what they meant.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.560]   It does seem like they're following in Apple's footsteps trying to do much more on device.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.360]   The assistant's going to do more on device stuff.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.000]   Google had talked about this a little at Google I/O that they were able to get their giant
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.280]   machine learning data sets squeezed down small enough that they could actually put it on
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.600]   the phone so that for instance, assistant will often be able to answer your questions,
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.120]   set timers, do some of the things you want to do without leaving, without going up to
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.760]   the cloud.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.160]   Same thing for face ID, your face is stored on the device.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.560]   I think this is again where competition is great.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.720]   Apple is sticking it to Google on privacy and Google's responding.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.400]   They're doing what Amazon did with the echo.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:43.160]   You can say delete what I just said, delete today's stuff, delete last week's stuff.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.360]   That's all really good.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.120]   And again, that's because--
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   There's clear performance benefits too though.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   Absolutely.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.480]   They're all doing it for performance reasons too.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.160]   I don't know if Siri does on device stuff yet.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   It does.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   The dictation part is on device.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.880]   It's got a bare minimum of stuff that it does on device.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.400]   And a lot of the machine learning stuff it does on device too before.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   A lot of it ends up on the cloud anyway, but it does a lot of the parsing on device.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.840]   I feel like they showed how the voice recorder now can transcribe as it's recording.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.920]   I feel like I'm going to take that to every meeting from now on, right?
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:23.160]   See, the first thing I was thinking of is like, how long before we see a sensational
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   piece?
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   So and so uses Google's-- Google has put a spy in your pocket that's automatically transcribing
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.640]   everything in the room that's ever said.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   Oh my god.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   It's like, OK.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.760]   It's also a voice recorder that every single phone and every single tape recorder made
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760]   can do.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   But OK.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.000]   I love the idea that you could-- even if it's not a perfect transcription that you'll
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.400]   have the text to searchable.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.560]   They did a live demo and was really keeping up word for word.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.480]   And the fact that it was all being done on device was pretty darn slick.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.840]   Would you say that Google just Sherlockt, every software company that already has an app that
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   lets you do that?
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:08.080]   Because really, they're putting built into their phone software that records and then
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.240]   transcribes and makes it searchable.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.400]   There are people out there.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.760]   There are programs out there that you have to pay money to do that with.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.280]   So it's kind of a big deal.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.680]   Look at an API and let other people make better front ends.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.880]   Well, actually, we're going to talk about Sherlocking in a little bit because there is
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.760]   a great blog post by the folks at Whomak-- what's it called?
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   The Little Talk?
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   Luna display.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   Luna, yeah.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   Ooh.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.960]   Astro pad makes Luna display, yeah.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.520]   They got Sherlockt by Sidecar and their response, which I thought was really good.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.320]   We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.880]   Laurie Gill, Andy Anako, Renee Ritchie.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   That was nice.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.880]   That was--
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.880]   Talk about a quick round the horn.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   Rough horn.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   Whoo.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.280]   It's a Mac break weekly assembled.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.720]   We'll get back to Morin just a bit.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.200]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.000]   Love these guys for quick and loans.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.120]   When it's time to buy a house, look at-- just go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.960]   You know, it's hard enough finding the right house.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.240]   Fortunately, getting the loan to buy the house is easy with Rocket Mortgage.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.120]   They do more to help you understand the home buying process than anybody else.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.280]   That means with that information, you can get exactly what you need.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.880]   It's not-- it's just some old mortgage.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   It's your mortgage.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.880]   Do it right.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.560]   They've got a team of mortgage experts that are obsessed with finding a better way.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   That means their number one goal is to make the home buying process smoother for you.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.440]   That's kind of a revolution.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.120]   A home mortgage company that's focused on customer service?
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.120]   What?
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:42.240]   Rocket Mortgage has award-winning client service and support every step of the way.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.560]   And I mean it when I say award-winning JD power has ranked quick and loans highest in
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.840]   customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origination, for almost a decade.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.980]   Now, nine years in a row.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.280]   They've done it six years in a row for mortgage servicing for JD Power Award Information.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.840]   Visit jdpower.com.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.240]   The other thing I love about Rocket Mortgage, they're changing the game with their industry
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.160]   leading online lending technology.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   Do it online.

[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.000]   We thank you for supporting us, Rocket Mortgage.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.280]   They've been a great sponsor for a couple of years now.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.360]   We thank you for supporting us by going to that URL, rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.040]   Well, Andy, only an hour.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.320]   You probably have only taken a few hundred pictures so far.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.000]   You tweeted a selfie that looked pretty good.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.640]   I was starting to do-- that's why I think we're in the commercial.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.840]   Like, OK, let me do a quick side-by-side of less nice colorful purple chair.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.600]   And let me take one with the iPhone 11.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.720]   Let's take one with this.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:32.120]   After the show, unfortunately, after the show, it'll be beautiful, sort of near twilight.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.480]   So yeah, I'm going to have a nice long walk.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:42.520]   If I get hit by taxi, it's probably going to be because I was holding one camera over
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.280]   one eye on the other camera over the other eye.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   I got to take this shutter at the same time or else the test is not valid.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:56.480]   It's interesting that Apple held back deep fusion.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.960]   I always thought they were waiting until they got their hands on a Pixel 4 and could
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.560]   see what they're doing and now they could best it.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.240]   Maybe that doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:11.480]   I thought that there was one-- everybody in the--
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.040]   Lorne was-- Lorne's favorite part was also my favorite part when they had Mark Lavoy,
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.120]   the Stanford professor, kind of invented-- excuse me, not invented, but one of the biggest
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.360]   names in computational photography and research.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.920]   And Google just went and hired him.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   Was that who was on stage?
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   Oh.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.920]   I have to like that.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.840]   I got a fanboy over him saying, "Mr. Professor Lavoy, I downloaded your iPhone app when you're
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   still at Stanford.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   I took my plastic house out to a waterfall."
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.360]   That's what I get right now.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.280]   What app did he do?
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.040]   Oh, I can't-- I can't scroll down for it.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   I'll find it.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:54.400]   It was the first procedural photography camera that I've ever seen.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.600]   So the only awkward moment in his presentation for me was he literally goes, "We're doing
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.560]   virtual lens modeling like Apple did last year and we're doing big object portrait mode
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.320]   like Apple did two years ago.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.200]   But ha ha, Apple's finally catching up on Fusion and semantics."
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.160]   And I'm like, "Just go."
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   I mean, just do it.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   You don't have to mention Apple one way or the other.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.560]   Well, there was one--
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.800]   Especially when you're saying you're catching up in one breath and then making fun of them
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   in the next.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.360]   I thought that could have been skipped and gone right into it.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.480]   Also, there's one fun part that only a research professor had to say.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.640]   Taking fun of the comment about deep fusion about, "Oh, there's computational photography
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   voodoo here."
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.520]   Without mentioning deep fusion at all, he said, "And we have all these techniques and
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.560]   layer and do do do do.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   It's not voodoo.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   It's just science."
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   It's raw.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.920]   It's sort of winked.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:54.360]   He did imply, however, there was a wink that maybe more features would be coming.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.120]   In other words, a software update.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:03.600]   He specifically was talking about how after showing off the new astrophotography, after
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.160]   the features of the new Pixel camera app, he was saying, "Oh, here's one thing we can't
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   do.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   Here's a picture.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.800]   We've got a beautiful picture of the moon.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:18.320]   And over here, we've got a beautiful picture of the scene entirely by moonlight.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.360]   But you see that the moon itself is over bright because there's like 18 stops of difference
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.000]   in dynamic range.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.280]   So this is one kind of picture that we can't actually do.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.120]   Let's stay tuned.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.120]   Stay tuned.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.160]   I was expecting him to say is, "Who was it?
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.000]   What was the phone company that might have been even Samsung that was had trained its
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.880]   camera app to say, 'If you see a moon in the sky, here is a high resolution image of what
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.280]   the moon looks like.'"
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.080]   Just sort of like stick it in there so that if you see a full moon, because the moon,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.280]   you always see the same side of it facing us at all times.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.640]   So you could just simply say, "Why don't we just paste in a really detailed version and
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.200]   think that we probably speak for dynamic range in detail."
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.920]   It's taking you a little too far.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.600]   Fake moon, fake moon.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:13.960]   You can probably render a better star scene than they can photograph at this point.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.640]   I was really impressed by the astrophotography images that he showed.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   That's hard to do.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:28.320]   And I guess the idea was that they're going to be able to down the road in a software update,
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:35.000]   be able to understand the dark foreground, the bright background and balance those and
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.840]   so forth.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.200]   They are also talking about without getting too heavily into detail.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.080]   After the Oolinao, Oolik, here's a star field, and look how beautiful it is, he had to point
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:53.000]   out that this is a stack of 16 photographs taken over an interval of something like three
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.840]   or four or five seconds.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.480]   And of course, the stars are moving so that we have, this software has to be aware that
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.760]   we don't want to have streaking stars.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.920]   And it really just puts, whether you're doing computational photography on Apple or on a
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.720]   Google product, it really makes you think about how everything is possible once you
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.280]   add intelligent software into this new layer of photography.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.160]   Well, we understand that if it looks like people have blurry eyes open and closed, the
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.240]   software should understand that humans don't look that way and should be able to pull like
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.040]   an open eye out of a previous frame or something.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.760]   So it's really is, it's amazing to see, but with Apple pushing Google and Google pushing
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:38.320]   Apple, exactly how insane photography can become in the next two or three years.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.160]   By the way, NASA, this is completely tangentially, but if you do want to cut and paste the moon
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:48.560]   into your photography, has released a CGI moon kit, a 3D elevations of the moon from
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:54.120]   satellite photography from the lunar reconnaissance orbiter and laser altimeter.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.680]   And so you could really, I mean, honestly, if you're making moon images, you might want
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.240]   to just think about pasting this in.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.200]   It'll be much more accurate.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:09.000]   It's gorgeous, gorgeous, high resolution 3D renderings.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.280]   All right, well, I can't wait to get my hands on it.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:21.320]   I feel like we're very fortunate because we get to use both the iPhone 11 Pro Max and
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   the Pixel 4 XL.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.920]   I carry both, you know, a Pixel and an iPhone with me at all the times.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.240]   I only wish I could take it on this trip because I'm, it's kind of a photography dream trip
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   and it would be really fun.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   Do you need a Batman belt yet, Leo, for all your phones?
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.400]   Well, if I wanted to carry them all, but you know, the light belt, you notice I wear suit
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.160]   jackets more because they have these two side panels so I can have a Pixel and I can have
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.520]   an iPhone and I, you know, except to remember which side is which.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.560]   So it's going to be harder with a Pixel 4.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.960]   That's why I bought the orange one because then I'll not confuse it.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.120]   It's the one with the big camera bump on the, oh, not doesn't help me.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.120]   Right.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:04.360]   I have to point out how close the Google camera bump looks to the iPhone camera bump, although
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:12.440]   theirs is arranged not in a sideways Mickey Mouse, but in a, no, there's the emoji surprise
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   face.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.720]   Yeah, there's a surprise face emoji.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.760]   The mouth is on the bottom with the two eyes above.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.200]   And then there's a sensor below it.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.920]   Lots of sensors in these phones nowadays.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.800]   That's what's really, I think, exciting.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   We live in wonders types.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   I was hopeful.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.000]   I was always hopeful that since they did project, what's it called that they would still stay
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.600]   with time of flight, but no, not yet.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.480]   Just because I think I got.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.640]   I think it got covered up.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.520]   What was Mark LaVoy's camera app that you were talking about was Synth Cam?
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   Synth Cam.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.360]   Yeah, it was for like the, it came out as early as I think the iPhone 3, but it was the first
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   procedure.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.640]   It was the first computational photography app I'd ever used.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:56.160]   And it was, it was the, I did take my, my, my little toy cows up to like the fish ladder
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   and Wolfam.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.040]   Because we have running water behind it and like, oh my God, look at it.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   It's like, it's like, I'm getting depth of field.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.920]   I'm getting focused on like, but this is just a crummy little, little camera phone.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   This shouldn't be possible.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.440]   My mind is blown.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.200]   And I do like, I do like the image that you posted on your Twitter feed, another image
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.720]   of a selfie from the Google event.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.400]   This one not nearly as, as nice.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.880]   And by the way, it wasn't even you, there's a camera and a hand in the picture.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.240]   That's the, that's the end.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   That's in any label.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.240]   It's, isn't it?
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.840]   Oh, is it any live what's, oh, yeah.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.040]   I get a screen above the, oh, I didn't see the bottom part.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.760]   That's Annie showing a picture she took.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.600]   And so that's her fingers and hands taking the picture of a guy doing a selfie.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.240]   It's an Elsie of a selfie Leo.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   It's meta.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:54.040]   That's actually, that's a, that is a hysterical picture.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   Of course, it's Annie.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.480]   It's the only saw the part you, you know, Twitter showed it didn't show the other part.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.000]   And I thought, oh, oh, would you, if you click on the image, you get a photo.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.880]   I almost wish they'd done a montage instead of an interview.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.920]   So we could have had more time in the front of the photos.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.120]   Because at least on the stream, they kept cutting back and forth.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.640]   I don't know what it was like in the, in the hall.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.240]   Did you get, did they, they stay on the pictures in the hall?
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   No, it was a, it was a slideshow and you get.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   Much nicer.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.360]   These one was about a few seconds and it was almost hard to concentrate because the pictures
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   were so beautiful.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.560]   Well, that's fun because Annie really didn't say anything.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.840]   She's, she's good.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840]   And I love her.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.360]   And it was, it's a good idea that Google brought her in as their celebrity.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.760]   She's the eye through which we've seen much of our modern lives.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   That's right.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:42.360]   Well, there was Martha Stewart, Martha Stewart was in the front row.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.480]   She kept taking photos.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.520]   I got a legitimate, I got a legitimate, like glimpse at her through a camera.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   So yeah.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.880]   I don't know why they didn't mention it.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.640]   They didn't mention like style or, okay, they mentioned how they want to, they, they want
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.600]   to make their new Wi-Fi base stations pretty so that you won't actually hide it behind,
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.480]   behind like a particle board and mute the, mute the signal like that.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   But yeah, it's not like they didn't, they're saying, they were not saying, oh, well, it's
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   a very good thing.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.880]   Or they didn't have like sort of a country tartan version of the, of the Google home.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.280]   One of our chatroom regulars, Edmonton Euler guy is a professional photographer.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.880]   He just chatted from the verge article.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.400]   I guess they had images, sample images in there.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.480]   He said, I could say that the iPhone 11 Pro has better lens correction and better exposure,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   warmer tones.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.600]   It achieves what most consumers want.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.960]   And that is just to shoot it once and use it.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.400]   I don't think most consumers are going to go out in a dark night and sit outside and take
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   astrophotography.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.840]   But I love that it's subjective differences now.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.280]   It's not like objectively this camera sucks and this one is good.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.120]   It's like these cameras are great and which do you subjectively like the artistic decisions
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.880]   that the different software companies made?
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.000]   Yeah, you have the choice.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   You have the choice.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.840]   And I think that's great.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.440]   I think Google would make a pixel camera app for iOS and other Android devices.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.040]   I could have them all on one device.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.680]   I'm just saying.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:13.360]   If you're wondering why Apple is so nice to China lately, maybe it has something to do
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:20.720]   with the fact that iPhone demand was up 230% in September.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.560]   Strong demand for the iPhone.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.880]   That shows that Apple has done something right because wasn't demand declining in China?
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.680]   Earlier.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.360]   Go ahead, Laura.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:39.920]   They did have their final numbers were lower than what they had originally estimated and
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.360]   they changed that before I think was that at the beginning of this year, I believe that
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.880]   that happened in January or March.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:54.440]   So according to the article in this great publication, I read all the time, I'm more.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.320]   2018, 110% growth.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   So doubling more than doubling, but still pretty good.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:10.840]   But this September 230%, which is a significant growth.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:19.120]   Yeah, so there's also the original analyst is kind of pointing to the iPhone 7 as the
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.520]   you know, upgrading from iPhone 7 as the reason.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:28.200]   But I would argue that the cheaper iPhone is actually a big deal right now.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   The iPhone 11 is the lowest priced iPhone.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   That's the big deal.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.120]   Of the main line that we've had in a while.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.560]   So I think while, yes, they are upgrading from the 7, I think the fact that they can
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.880]   finally get it a little bit cheaper is really what's pushing such a huge jump in numbers
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:49.400]   from more than doubling that same amount from a year ago at this time.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.640]   So I think that the low cost iPhone really helps out.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.320]   The analyst is Timothy Arcuri.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:03.240]   And he's quoted by Philip Elmer DeWitt on his PED30.com site.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.000]   He says, "Several factors contribute to strong iPhone demand, including a better trade-in
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   program from Apple."
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.600]   "A more attractive price point for the base model, as you said, Lori, and service is bundled
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.680]   with hardware.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.760]   And given the largest mix of phones in the installed base in China, the iPhone 7 is three
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   generations old."
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   It's time.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.880]   In other words, time to buy a new iPhone, even in China.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:37.920]   Last time we spoke, Apple had restored the app, HKMAP.live, that showed police presence
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.480]   in Hong Kong.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.440]   They have now removed it again, and I think finally removed it.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:53.520]   Tim Cook said a memo internally to Apple employees saying that the company had removed the app
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:59.680]   after receiving "credible information from the authorities," i.e. the Hong Kong police,
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.720]   and people in Hong Kong that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:09.200]   for violence and to victimize individuals of property where no police are present.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.280]   As a result, Cook said the app violated Apple rules and local laws.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.720]   And so we have to pull it down.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   John Gruber was a little critical of that memo.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.720]   As was Mache Chaglowski, Mache is the creator of Pinboard.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.520]   His blog, idolwords.com, has in the last few months been recording what's been going on
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.000]   in Hong Kong because he's on the ground.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.160]   And following the protests, Mache says the first application that the app was being used
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.000]   maliciously makes no sense at all.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.880]   The app does not show the locations of individual officers at all.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.840]   It shows general concentrations of police units with a significant lag.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.400]   The app is aggregating reports from Telegram, Facebook, and other sources.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.920]   It beggars belief.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:02.200]   Mache writes that a campaign to target individual officers would use a world-readable crowdsourcing
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.520]   format like this.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.760]   Can Mr. Cook point to a single example of that?
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.600]   Can anyone?
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.320]   So he says it not only goes against the evidence, it goes against the documentary record of
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.880]   18 weeks of protests and not even possible given the technical constraints of the app.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.480]   He also says the second allegation that the app victimizes individuals and property were
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.800]   no police are present.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   He says does Mr. Cook have any evidence for this claim?
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.720]   The app does not show an absence of police.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.760]   It shows concentrations of police.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:40.000]   So Gruber concludes, "I can't recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.800]   under scrutiny for a company that usually measures umpteen times before cutting anything.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.200]   It's both sad and startling."
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   Thoughts?
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.160]   No, I think I said something very similar.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.000]   You usually see like few jobs, thoughts on flash and you think that so much time and
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.200]   effort went into this and Apple's not been known for crisis PR.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.040]   They've been known for very methodical, very thought out, almost bulletproof PR where you
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:12.240]   can disagree with it, but you can't just quickly say how it has no foundation or substance.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.680]   And this just came off as really fast and really fragile and very different than I think
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.400]   you've ever seen comms from Apple before.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.320]   And remember, it wasn't public comms.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.720]   It was intended for the Apple employees, but that doesn't excuse me.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   Those always come out.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   No, I think that those always come out.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.080]   It's only a bit of a press release, but we have press release.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.280]   And what really marked it as kind of gutless for me is that they didn't take a stand as
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.720]   we think it's the right thing to do at this time given the situation in Hong Kong.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.160]   It was we have two rea-we are, our hands are tied.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:50.720]   It violates local law and we are, we always say that we have to obey local law and it
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.280]   violates app developer guidelines.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.680]   And we always say that things have to, we have no opinion one way or another.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.720]   It could be any country of anyone.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.520]   It's like, for heaven's sake, it's like just take a stand.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.160]   Even if it's a stand that you think you're going to get jumped on for, don't just say
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.520]   our hands are tied.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.080]   It violates local laws, again, debatable.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:16.280]   It violates app guidelines well again, look, are you going to take down the ways app because
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   it shows people where police are staked out on highways so they can avoid speed tracks,
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.280]   straps and drunk checkpoints.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.440]   Again, it's just gutless.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.440]   Laurie?
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:35.160]   That's exactly, Andy, the point I was going to make was just that when Apple originally
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:41.040]   pulled it, the developer said, we're not giving, this is not an app.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.560]   To help you avoid the police, this is not an app to help you find the police.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.280]   This just shows some things.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.560]   What you do with this information is out of our hands.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:59.840]   So Apple led it back into the app store under that idea and then pulled it again because
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:05.240]   they have evidence that it's being used to hurt people.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:09.440]   Well, I have evidence that Tinder is used to rape people.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.480]   So that doesn't mean anything.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.800]   Just because somebody is using it inappropriately from its original intent doesn't mean that
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:22.040]   it should be removed from the app store because then under that circumstance, you'd have to
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.560]   pull a lot of things.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:31.360]   You'd have to pull ways for showing where there's drunk DUI checkpoints.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.600]   The app itself is not committing an illegal act.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.400]   It's what people are doing with it, which is out of the hand of the developer.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:44.360]   Under their circumstances, Apple should have fought against the Chinese government's opinion
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.400]   that it's illegal, which I don't think it is.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:53.960]   Well, let's also reflect on the fact that when they approved the app, the Chinese Communist
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.800]   Party newspaper had this editorial.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.000]   I can't remember the headline off the top of my head, but it was all on the lines of
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.080]   our, as Apple, out of their minds.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:08.560]   And the text of the editorial was like, I can't believe they're aligning themselves
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   with hooligans and criminals.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.080]   And we have no, we should question their motives and we should, and it's, it's, it's
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.800]   an unbelievable stuff from the take, given that there will almost certainly be consequences
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.240]   for Apple in the future based on this.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:29.040]   And I can't, I believe that this, this editorial with appropriate translation landed on the
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.920]   desks of people in Cupertino.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.800]   That might have influenced their decision.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.160]   It was aimed at them.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.160]   It was aimed at them.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.760]   It was read this.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.600]   This is what the Chinese government, this is what president Xi says.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.960]   Now what are you going to do?
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.720]   It is startling how EU regulation cannot, cannot affect change as much as a single
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.480]   sigh in a Chinese government.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.200]   And you know, I don't want to re litigate it because we, we spent a long time on Wednesday,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:01.360]   last Wednesday on this week in Google and again on Sunday on a twit talking about this.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.760]   And I don't, you know, I want to, I want to sit on the fence on this one.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.680]   On the one hand, I feel like if you're an American company, you should stand up for
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.880]   freedom of speech, liberty.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.040]   And if you're in a country that is authoritarian and trying to sell products there, maybe you
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.760]   should think rethink your stance there.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:23.720]   On the other hand, Apple has a responsibility to a shareholders, if not a stakeholders,
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.120]   to a shareholders to make a lot of money.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.520]   And there's no bigger market than the Chinese market.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.280]   And they're making a lot of money there.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.800]   And so, you know, they're not going to pull out of China.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:41.960]   And that's really the choice is pull out of China or follow the laws in China.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.360]   And I so I don't, I don't, it's a tough place to be.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.040]   I'd like to see more spine from Apple, but it's not me.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.080]   It's not my choice to make.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.680]   It's their choice to make.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.240]   Yeah, that's, that's true.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.080]   And but the thing is, that's, I keep saying this, I don't know where the line is that Apple
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.480]   is not willing to cross when it comes to China, I wish I wish I could say that I knew that
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:04.800]   there's a line which they would say, no, we will absolutely, we will absolutely not
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.520]   acquiesce to this.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:14.000]   And the fact that the fact that even the idea of complying with local laws in the United
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.960]   States of America, how many horrendous injustices in the past 100 years have been committed,
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:26.520]   that was absolutely in line, has actually been underscored and promoted by actual laws
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.680]   that helped these injustices to happen.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:33.440]   At some point they have to say, it's not enough that that an app simply abides by our developer
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.440]   guidelines.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.880]   It doesn't, it's not enough to say that it's legal.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.960]   It does things that are legal in this country.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:44.440]   At some point, Apple has to say either they do have to say, here is lines we do not cross.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:49.120]   Here's why we're making these decisions, or they have to stop pretending that they are
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:55.040]   actually for justice, that they are actually for freedom, that they're actually for privacy,
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.600]   because otherwise they have to really defend themselves against the argument that they
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.640]   are for these things when the optics are good and when it suits them.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.960]   We're running late, we'll get sorry.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.000]   I'm talking to somebody in the studio, not you.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.240]   I'm just telling folks in the studio that we're getting to a cure right now and about
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.840]   half an hour running a little.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.200]   And that's because we started Mac Break Weekly a little late because Leo goes on and on.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:23.240]   And one thing just worth pointing out is that Tim Cook gets into a lot of trouble because
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.520]   he believes in engagement.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.640]   And I said last week, it sometimes engagement becomes a piece and you have to be very careful.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.960]   But there's that editorial slamming him for working with the Trump administration, the
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.600]   editorial slamming him for working with some of the governments that extract rare earth
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.160]   materials in Latin America and Africa.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:44.520]   And he is very consistent in this, but to Andy's point, there has to be a line because
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.520]   there are things.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.080]   And it's not an Apple question, it's a tech question because we see all sorts of tech
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.080]   questions.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.520]   And I have a question for American companies in general.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.800]   American companies broke my heart last week in many, many ways.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.280]   And it's not going to, and they've been doing it for a week.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.480]   There's always like, there was a story with can you still use Emacs?
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.480]   Can you still use Android?
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.640]   Like what point do you have like, do you have your own sense of ethics and your sense
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   of products?
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   Emacs is a great example.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   Richard Stalman.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   Android is too now.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   Richard Stalman wrote it.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.360]   Andy Rubin created Android.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:23.760]   And actually, honestly, we're increasingly surrounded by authoritarian countries.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.080]   Are you just going to stop selling to everybody?
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.440]   Andy with Microsoft for having ice deals, but also for like being pro environment, but
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.080]   selling to a lot of anti-environment.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.720]   And yet the only tool consumers have, the only tool even journalists like us have is
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.320]   either is not buying the products and for us to call them out.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.760]   I don't think Tim Cook and Apple would be getting as much heat on this if they didn't
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.600]   constantly say how they stand up for privacy, freedom.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   You know, they...
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   The whole liberties.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.040]   Yes, civil liberties, environmental causes, if they're...
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040]   Over Kennedy.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.560]   If they didn't say that over and over again, I don't know.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.360]   I mean, nobody's yelling at Ford Motor Company.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.880]   I mean, it's just...
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.640]   I mean, Disney opened Disney Shanghai, right?
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   Right.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   Right.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.040]   So, I don't know what the answer is.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]   There...
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.880]   This kind of opens up like a larger global discussion.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.920]   I've mentioned this before.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:26.440]   Really, there isn't a lot that you can argue against adhering to regulations in a different
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   country.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.280]   You know, like I think I had mentioned that that becomes ethnocentric when we start trying
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.040]   to impose our beliefs on them, though there are in some circumstances.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.200]   I do think that we should try to impose our beliefs.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:42.000]   But to me, the more frightening thing, the thing that's bigger and deserves more conversation
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.360]   is how, right now, using this example, the Chinese government is influencing how we censor
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:55.200]   our own people here in the United States by banning people from Twitch, firing them for
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:02.360]   being a part of the interview, by finding NBA players for speaking out.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.120]   This is censoring people in the US because of influence from an outside country.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.040]   That to me is much bigger than we're pulling an app from the Chinese app store.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.040]   That's their own country.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040]   That's their own thing.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:18.880]   It is big, but bigger is that we're allowing another country to censor us because of finance,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   because of money.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.400]   And it's going to happen more and more and more and more, by the way.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.640]   That's very frightening to me.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.120]   It wasn't as big a problem when China was content to suppress its own citizens, but to
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   kind of play a more open, more liberal global game because they wanted to participate in
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.120]   the global economy.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.120]   But now you're seeing China.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.000]   And they're doing it in the open, which if they were doing it secretly, you wouldn't
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.040]   even know about it, but they're doing it in the open, which kind of Streisand affects
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.040]   it at the same time.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.040]   That's true.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.080]   But it's worrisome when they do do it because we don't know all the times they're doing
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.480]   it without telling us.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.480]   Good point.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.000]   Well, it's just that I think there was a part of arrogance and Apple in any other company
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.360]   that said, Oh, look, we're going to invest in China because look, they're becoming more
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.280]   Western and more open and more exact.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.640]   And they were in the 80s with the Tiananmen.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.920]   Well, they thought it would become more that way by investing.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   Yes, exactly.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.720]   Well, invite them into the global world, but economy.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.640]   Instead of thinking that China is its own country, it's this own culture.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.320]   It's not that they're not they're not they're not trying to become more like us.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.800]   They're trying to become more like them, which is what every single independent Republican
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.760]   republic tries to be.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.120]   So I think there was a certain amount of arrogance and saying, well, of course, they're
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.920]   going to become their so the communism is going to go away.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.440]   They're becoming going to become democracy.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.560]   We thought that by the way, that's a thousand years of history.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.440]   We thought that in Russia, we thought that the Soviet Union, in fact, we did with some
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.360]   success bring down the Soviet Union and liberalize Russia until we didn't.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.320]   So jeans and Beatles records.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.200]   There is a certain arrogance in the in the American way of thinking.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:00.160]   In fact, it goes back to Great Britain and what they used to call the white man's burden.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.360]   It's a it is an arrogance that our way is the right way.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360]   And we'll just.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.280]   And Russia fought back with Facebook bots who saw it coming.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.000]   We're going to we're living in the challenging world and increasingly challenging world.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.320]   And it's going to be hard for a company.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320]   We have each other.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.840]   We have each other.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.840]   That's right.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.040]   Thank goodness.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.200]   Somebody in the chat room thought of a great conspiracy theory that perhaps by making by
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:31.000]   pulling the app, then putting the app back, they were sending a signal to Hong Kong citizens
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.720]   download this app quickly and they gave them a few days and then they pulled it finally.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720]   I like that idea.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   I don't know.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.240]   I was accidentally unable side loading in China.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   Oops.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   Is an ex-boy.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.640]   I think Apple does do that.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   They do do that.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.900]   I mean, in response to governments asking for information from the phone, they have been
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:56.120]   working as fast as their little hearts can to put more and more stuff under encryption.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   So they do do that.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.280]   They do act kind of quickly before anybody notices.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.680]   Let's make the whole thing encrypted.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.160]   That's not going to matter if a country and we're not just talking about China here.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.240]   We've passed a little bit on Australia.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.520]   That simply says, well, if our law says that the government is entitled to all the data
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.720]   that's on the phone, if you want to just encrypt it and then let us decrypt it, that's
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   fine.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.040]   We don't care how you do it, but you better give us the clear text.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.360]   That sounds like an Apple problem, not an R-government problem.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:29.200]   Right now, that's England and Australia asking for that, of course, following along on Russia,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.640]   China and other countries.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.840]   I think it's only a matter of time.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:40.960]   Already our government, the American government has been demanding similar features, back doors.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960]   Let's take a little break out.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.800]   There is a important update on Catalina.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.720]   I think I want to talk about Catalina a little bit.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.200]   There have been problems.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.440]   But first, a word from our sponsor, FreshBooks.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:57.200]   The number one accounting software in the cloud, when I used many years and was so happy,
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.360]   when I discovered FreshBooks, FreshBooks takes the stress out of accounting for you
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:07.040]   and your business with easy to use billing, expense organization, time tracking, all
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.480]   at your fingertips in the FreshBooks, dashboard on the web or on the FreshBooks app, if you're
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.880]   self-employed or a small business and you're still back in the days where you had to fire
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.480]   up Word and Excel to do invoicing, stop it.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.720]   Stop the insanity.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720]   That's what I did.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.360]   This is back in 2004.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.120]   When I found FreshBooks, they make beautiful invoices, makes it easy to send them.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.880]   You can include billable hours and expenses automatically and invoices.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.280]   Just snap a picture of a receipt.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.480]   It goes into the invoice.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.080]   Easy invoicing means you've got more time to grow your clients list, to serve your clients
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:46.320]   better, to share in their success, to do what you love, not the boring paperwork.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.120]   If you have a team, FreshBooks is awesome.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.960]   You can give them all the FreshBooks app, collaborate with your team on a single platform.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:59.760]   You can utilize specific team members by assigning them the manager role in certain areas.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.800]   That means your second in command can manage a project or two, or all of them in billing.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.560]   Other team members can be managed more effectively.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.880]   In one tool, you get back again to the work that only you can do.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.800]   If you're always on the go, FreshBooks has you covered.

[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.080]   are.

[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.320]   device is convenient for you right now, and you'll never miss any important information.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.120]   I love FreshBooks.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120]   You will, too.

[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:25.960]   Today, right before we went on the air, Apple released a Mac OS X Catalina supplemental update
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:32.680]   with a lot of fixes that include improved installation reliability.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.640]   A lot of people have been complaining about Catalina stalling.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.680]   Sounds like this Apple fix has to do with Mac with low disk space.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:45.400]   Remember, under the hood we talked about this last week, Catalina is dramatically changing
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.880]   your volume organization under APFS.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.680]   And of course, there's probably needs a lot of free disk space to do that.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.560]   So they've fixed that issue.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.440]   It also says, Apple also says it fixes an issue that prevented setup a system from completing.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   So there you go.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.000]   That was that stall we were hearing about.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.200]   Resolves an issue that prevents accepting iCloud terms and conditions when multiple accounts
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.480]   are logged in.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:15.960]   I don't know if this is a bug that gets fixed, but every time I install Catalina on a machine,
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.520]   I have to log in the iCloud.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.960]   I counted it last night a dozen times.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.120]   It doesn't, Leo.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   What the hell?
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.920]   It's a little bit more than a machine as well.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.560]   So maybe this is fixed.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.560]   You have that too.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.860]   I thought maybe it's just me.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.540]   I had it a little bit on Catalina a lot on iOS 13.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:35.620]   Crazy.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:41.040]   So eventually I just copied the clipboard, I'm just pasting and pasting.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.800]   And then the worst thing is on the Mac, it's saying, okay, now log into the Mac.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.520]   Okay, now give me the iCloud account.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.320]   It's going back and forth and it's not predictable.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.560]   So it's like I pasted it wrong and now I got it felt like.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.360]   So this has actually been an issue for me.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.000]   This has been an issue for me on Mojave.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.600]   I didn't, I thought it was my computer.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.560]   It was, it was, me too.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.800]   It was bad on Mojave.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.360]   It's really bad on Catalina.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.600]   I counted it last night.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.240]   It was more than a dozen times.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.840]   I was going nuts.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.200]   You have, do we know?
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.200]   It feels like it.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   Yeah, it feels like there.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.560]   So there is a state where it can be authorized to accept your security credentials and it
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:27.920]   sort of plays passcode or computer, computer password against iCloud password and accounts
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.840]   and uses them to verify each other.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.080]   You know, when you set up new devices.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.480]   Do you think it's worse because we all have a lot of Apple devices?
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.400]   No, I think, I think the installation lost both and now it's trying to authorize one
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.800]   off the other and it's going back and forth until it finally sneaks one in and then gets
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.800]   the other one off the road.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.800]   I feel like that.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.800]   I'm doing it as fast as I can.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.640]   And it's just like, it's like dumb luck.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.400]   But Gretzky algorithm.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.920]   Shoot to where the puck is going.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   Not where it is.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.160]   I'm going to find that up right corner.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.160]   Hit it.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.240]   We're here to really hit it where the goal is living.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.760]   So I don't know if this 10 dot 15 dot one fixes that, but it does say resolves an issue
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.800]   that prevents accepting iCloud terms and conditions when multiple iCloud accounts are
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.800]   logged in.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   I wonder if that's related.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.440]   It also says it improves the reliability of saving game center data in Apple arcade
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.400]   games when you're playing offline.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.680]   You're going to want to apply this update.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.080]   There's also 13.1.3 for iOS.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.080]   Yes.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.440]   Oh, it's another regular update.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.960]   Let me just start that on my iPad.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.800]   What's 13.1.3 doing?
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.480]   A lot of bug fixes.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.200]   We've got basically the same thing going on.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.200]   There is.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.600]   Later, I bet you the Catalina update also fixes there.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:55.080]   Linux distros are updating like crazy today because there was a flaw in the pseudo algorithm
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.720]   that allowed anybody with the user minus one.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.960]   You can kind of think of why this might have worked.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:11.160]   It's a overflow error to log in as a super user and you know, RM star, RM dash RF star.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.320]   Do whatever they wanted to.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.120]   So that pseudo is a big, bad problem.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.840]   The SU do command on Linux.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:26.400]   And since Apple does also have SU do on its terminal in Macintosh, I wonder if they're
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   also fixing that.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.040]   I would guess they are.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.200]   Because that's a pretty serious flaw.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:38.480]   So anyway, we have no reason not to update, right?
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.720]   I'm advising people unless there's a feature you really, really want need.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.160]   I don't think there's any reason not to wait at least a month, month and a half, two months.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.880]   Hold off on Catalina, right?
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   Definitely.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.160]   If you're already on the run, the bug fixes.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   But what about 13?
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.640]   I mean, we're at 13.1.3.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.160]   This is the fourth update.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]   Oh, it's 13.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.560]   Since the iPhone came out on the 20th.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.560]   That's in three weeks.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.440]   Four updates.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440]   Is it done?
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:14.240]   I mean, you haven't updated to 13 right now at this point.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.480]   I don't see why you shouldn't just wait till 13.2.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.240]   You know, wait, just wait a little longer.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240]   I see one reason.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.560]   If you have an iPad Pro, iPad OS really is great.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.560]   Okay.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.320]   So iPad, iPad OS 13.1.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.520]   But yeah, I mean, if you're holding off then just because we're seeing so many bug fix
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:41.240]   updates, we, you know, for people who don't need it, just wait until 13.2.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.640]   Just by then I bet most of these little glitches and bug fixes will be worked out.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.080]   There might be new ones with 13.2.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.280]   But I think, you know, I think most of the pain points will be taken care of at that
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280]   point.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.880]   A lot of companies are warning their users, especially pro software users, not to go to
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   Catalina.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.480]   Adobe is saying that audio production do not.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:08.960]   If there is a piece of software that you really have to have that really has to work, I would
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.840]   check with the company to see what they say about Catalina because there are known issues,
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.960]   not just the 32-bit issue.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.440]   There's a number of known issues.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.840]   You know, one thing I think, remember we were worried about notarizing?
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.840]   Yep.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840]   Those are the apps.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.840]   Yes.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   Yes.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.840]   So this is a, I had somebody email me and I, and I, he uses Final Cut and be uses a
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.200]   lot of pro apps and he has a particular app that he uses.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.920]   The company said, yeah, we're working with Apple to get approval to update our app because
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.520]   right now it won't work on Catalina.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.080]   So this is the current in Catalina.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:54.480]   The new rule is if you are an Apple developer, if you have a certificate for your software,
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.760]   you must get it notarized.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.360]   And if it is, if you have a certificate, if you're Apple developer and it's not notarized,
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.200]   it will not be installable on Catalina.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200]   Is that right?
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   That's what he told me.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.360]   I don't think the answer to the patient exists anymore.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.720]   You can't right click and open anymore.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   Correct.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.720]   That's, yeah.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.720]   What about now?
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.720]   There is a terminal.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.880]   The opening from an unknown developer is no longer available at all.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.000]   You can't go into your settings and change that to, to like force the allowance.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.080]   And there is a terminal command.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.280]   We do have a how to guide on IMRA about that.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.400]   But I know Renee doesn't want us to tell people because it really is a bad idea because
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.080]   you're, you're disabling gatekeeper to be able to do it.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.080]   So it's really not.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   No, I just think it's for experts.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.960]   I don't think people should really nilly go do it.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.120]   But I think if you were the kind of person who wants to run those apps, you know, well,
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.560]   I'm going to tell everybody to do it because I'll tell you why I had to.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.920]   And if you do the command, and by the way, read, because the nice thing is, and I, I
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.960]   by the way, sent my car, the person was saying, Oh my God, what do I do?
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.920]   I sent him the link to this because you do talk about turning it on and off.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.080]   You talk about the consequences of it.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:12.800]   But one thing I noticed when you do issue the command, it does all it does is add anywhere
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.400]   to your, the old setting that was always there, you know, allow apps downloaded from
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.480]   app store, app store, and if I developers anywhere, isn't it the case that I can then
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.760]   say anywhere, install that app and then go back to a safer thing without disabling it.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.440]   So it's really just adding that feature to disable it temporarily.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.640]   So what you should do is go ahead, issue that command, know that you'll now be completely
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.940]   open to anything from the internet, download and install whatever it was you wanted and
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:51.800]   immediately go back into security and privacy and, and, and turn gatekeeper back on, right?
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.800]   On.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.800]   That's the safest way to do that.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.720]   I don't, I don't approve of Apple locking down our Macs the way it locks down our iPhones.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.280]   I think it's great on our phones, but on the Mac you're, you're, we have, there are hundreds
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.600]   and hundreds of fantastic developers that are not, you know, they didn't go through
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.600]   the Apple channels.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.680]   It's nothing personal.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.520]   They just, they're also making for all these other operating systems.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.200]   So, you know, why do they have to do that?
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   So they don't.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.840]   It doesn't mean that they're nefarious.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.160]   It doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.520]   They're fantastic developers that make fantastic apps and Apple trying to lock down our Macs
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.200]   like that is, I just don't think it's a good idea.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.040]   We're, we're not, Mac users are not the same as iPhone users in that we know what we're
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.360]   getting into, you know, with phones it's a little more confusing.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.760]   Like, how did I accidentally download malware or something like that?
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.480]   But on your Mac, you're, you're much more aware of, you know, what you're allowing these
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480]   systems to do.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:56.120]   I love a lot of the features that are now in place on Catalina warning me about, you
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.520]   know, some kind of software that's running in the background that I didn't know about,
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.200]   asking me if I want to allow this app to have Bluetooth when why in the world with that
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.160]   app, need Bluetooth, things like that.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.520]   But this sort of thing of like forcing developers to jump through these hoops, just to be able
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.920]   to have these things available to download on Catalina to me is a little bit, it's a
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.680]   little too helicopter mom, you know?
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:25.760]   They're, they're getting into our business a little bit too much, you know?
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:34.280]   So I just to test this in Catalina, I have, I have an app that I had written, I compiled
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.480]   it, ran it, opened it, no problem.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:42.240]   So the, that's the good news is that if you're a developer, you're writing your own apps,
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.520]   I didn't even have to right click it.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.520]   It just opened.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.120]   I'm not sure why it opened.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.080]   It wasn't, I wasn't doing the next code, but it did.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.280]   So, but I do worry that apples, that this is just the beginning of a continuous squeeze
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.200]   that the next, and yes, they give us this terminal command.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.880]   Everybody should go to iMore and learn the terminal command because you might need this,
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.960]   but I'm worried that they, in the next version, they won't even allow that is, are we, do
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.480]   you think it's reasonable to say we're going to get to a point where Apple's going to
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:15.040]   say, you can only install software on your Macintosh from a developer with a, with that
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.560]   is certified and notarized.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.240]   Is that going to happen?
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.760]   Or even worse, you have to get it from the app store like you do on an iPhone.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.760]   I don't want that.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.760]   I don't either.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.040]   I don't want it to be constructed that way.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.560]   It would kill Macintosh for a whole segment of people who are software developers.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:39.480]   Because if I can't run a program I wrote on my Mac, I'm not going to use a Mac, period.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.800]   Yeah, for me it's just a case of ownership.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.520]   If I spend a couple of grand on a computer and I don't get to do whatever I want with
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.320]   it, no matter how silly or self-destructive it is, I don't really own it.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.200]   I'm just leasing it from Apple at a very high price.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:20:00.120]   Which is the argument people give for iPhone, but again, I, the way-
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.920]   It's okay on a phone, isn't it?
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.120]   Yeah, the way it is, the computer's-
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.120]   Yeah, the way it is, the computer's-
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.600]   The nature of the threat model on phones is very different.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   It's very different.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.320]   It's very primary computing devices, so we're going to have to have this whole discussion
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   again.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   And Apple at some point is going to have to, there will some point be new operating systems.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.320]   Like Microsoft is beginning to feel around with that in Google with Fusion.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.240]   Apple's going to have to do that as well.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.960]   And what's the operating system that's based in the cloud, runs off AI, and has multiple
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.200]   endpoints that you just manifest with.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.680]   What's the security model on those?
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   I don't know.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.680]   But I would hope that iOS would become more like the Mac, not the other way around in
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.680]   that.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.760]   And I understand all the risks, but just the ability to put an economy code and say, you
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.960]   know, I'm a grown ass adult and I want to play with my phone.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.200]   It's absolutely awesome.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   That's absolutely awesome.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.640]   At that point, I mean, the good news is Linux has come along.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.720]   Linux is really good.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.720]   I love Linux.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.360]   I will not use Windows when I get a Windows machine.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.840]   I pretty much put Linux.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.040]   Windows has gotten worse and worse and worse, by the way.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.480]   If you think it's bad on the Apple side, Windows is far worse.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:08.080]   And then there is a company called Purism that makes a phone now, the Libram 5, that
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   is also free and open software.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.320]   It even has an interchangeable battery.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.720]   So I've ordered one of these because I think we should talk about it on the shows.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.080]   I mean, it is obviously not nearly as elegant as an iPhone.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:27.400]   But if we get to the position where, you know, these things become locked down rentals from
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:32.280]   big companies, we're going to be very glad that there's an open source movement to do
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   this.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.640]   I don't want to make this analogy, but I'm going to make it anyway.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.280]   The sort of the way that I positioned it is that for a bunch of people, a feature phone
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   was fine.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.680]   They bought and got their flip phone, they got their candy bar phone, nobody knew where
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.280]   it cared what it ran.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.720]   And I think for those people, which is not an insignificant part of the market, having
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.720]   a locked on operating system like iOS is fine.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.720]   Like they don't want to do any work.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.720]   They just want the phone.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.960]   They want to press Facebook.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.120]   Do whatever they want.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   It's fine.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.600]   I just think it's good to have alternatives.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.480]   And if you want like Android to play around with it for whatever, great.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.080]   It's great that we have alternatives from different companies.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.400]   And the Mac, I'm going to echo a thing.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.400]   It's different in kind and it has to remain different in kind.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.440]   Otherwise, there's no point to its existence.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.080]   I completely understand why they're doing it.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.080]   I mean, for the normal person, it's just making it safer.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080]   Yes.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.160]   And those normal people, they're happy downloading from the app store.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.800]   They're happy locked down.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.240]   Malware, you know, ransomware in particular, and Steve's about to do our regular weekly
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.320]   ransomware report is a nightmare.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.840]   And so, you know, I'm terrified.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:39.200]   I went into our staff meeting last week and I said, what are we doing to because I don't
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.360]   want to, you know, it was bad enough.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.520]   We had a power outage last week.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   I don't want to see.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.240]   And my company brought to its knees by ransomware.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.560]   Fortunately, we have a very good IT guy named Russell and he is keeping us safe and secure
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.560]   so far.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.400]   But I really worry every business should worry.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:59.520]   So you're going to see pressure to make much more locked down systems and there are going
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.480]   to be plenty of people saying, lock me down.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.480]   Give me a comment code.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.480]   Give me a comment.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.480]   I agree with that.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.040]   Something secret, something on iMore.com that we can use.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.040]   Yes.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.040]   Happy with it.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.000]   I go to terminal and literally type in up, down, down, left, right, left, right, right,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   A, B, and then press enter.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   I'm happy with that.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   I'm happy with that.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   That's fine.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.520]   I love how, I love how on Android you can turn on developer mode by doing a good, doing
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:25.360]   a good info and tapping like the system information like a ridiculous number of times.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   That's their economy code, isn't it?
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.520]   You're not going to do it by random chance.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.480]   You did it because you looked and found it and then if you, okay, any idiot who's willing
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:38.360]   to tap this thing damn thing 18 times in a row is funny because you type it like six
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.360]   times and it says you're getting there.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.400]   It actually says just a few more times.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.080]   It's really, don't believe you yet.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.720]   Twitter is now a catalyst app on the Macintosh.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.560]   Macintosh came out today.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.560]   I don't particularly celebrate this, but if you're curious, if you want to use catalyst
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.560]   is your catalyst curious.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:08.920]   So I actually, I thought this was a big deal to have the Twitter app on Mac again because
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.840]   I am not a crazy Twitter user.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:16.080]   I'm one of those bottom of the barrel basic vanilla users.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.320]   I barely use it for anything.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.440]   So I was excited to kind of, I was, yeah, I was, I was excited to go back to the, to
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.520]   the bare bones that the Twitter app is.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.880]   I downloaded and installed it.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.680]   It's exactly the same as the Twitter app used to be from Mac before they pulled it from,
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.080]   from, from the Mac.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.880]   And it, it was like, it's like broken.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.800]   It won't do anything like it.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.800]   All of the status.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.960]   So like I, I try to click on, you know, a Twitter, something shows up on my feet and
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.360]   I click on it to read the threads and it says, there's nothing here to see.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.280]   I click on, you know, somebody sends me a direct message in my little inbox and I click on
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.240]   the Twitter link to see the original tweet.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.440]   There's nothing here to see.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   So I don't know.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.880]   It's like really broken right now.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.160]   It doesn't seem to be working, right?
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.640]   At least not on my computer.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.840]   I haven't actually tried to, you know, deleting it and reinstalling it.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.600]   I haven't done the troubleshooting thing, but so I don't know.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.480]   Like it wasn't that great to me.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.480]   We didn't talk about it.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.800]   But last week, Mark Gurman wrote an article for Blurmberg saying Apple's merged iPad Mac
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.800]   apps leave developers uneasy.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   They're just paying twice.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.080]   Apparently it is not as easy for a developer to, as Apple said, just flip a switch and
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.480]   suddenly your iOS app is on Macintosh.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:34.040]   And he points out that really users shouldn't have to think about it.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.160]   It should just happen and it's not.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.880]   It's a little more nuanced than that because some developers don't like some developers,
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.760]   their livelihood depends on you paying for the software.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   They write.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.520]   And for years, they've been sort of grouchy that Apple wants you to give away the iPad app
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.640]   for free when you get the iPhone app.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   Definitely great for users.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.200]   It's not always great for developers.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.560]   And Apple doesn't, there's universal binaries for iPhone and iPad.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.160]   There's universal bundles that include the Apple TV app.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.760]   Watch app is still bundled in with the iOS app.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.000]   There's no universal bundles yet for Mac apps.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.880]   So apparently that's coming probably next year where you will be able to use the same
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.800]   receipt to just unlock it everywhere.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.000]   And developers are jittery about that because again, you know, it's work to make the Mac
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   version.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.280]   And then expectation will be it's free.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.680]   And then someone will say, well, just do subscription and they'll be like, my customers
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680]   have 100 subscriptions, dude.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   What am I supposed to do?
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.360]   So I think it's way, it's a way deeper discussion than that article really dives into.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:38.280]   I do not like the idea of let's go back to, you know, your app should be free on all devices.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:45.560]   That we made that mistake when the app store first came out and we users all expected 99
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.560]   cent apps, even though developers were spending their blood, sweat and tears to make this
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.080]   amazing product for them.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.120]   And by saying this, this app that's basically an iPad app should be free on Mac, it's, that's
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:00.640]   dangerous because it's not, it's not easy to make it, you know, just like the Bloomberg
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.800]   report says it's, it's difficult to use to just transfer it to catalyst.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.320]   You don't just click a button and suddenly it's there.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.160]   So, you know, on the one hand to say, these should all be free.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.560]   And then on the other hand to say, you know, it's difficult for developers to do, you're,
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.360]   you're proving the point that it should be something that is paid, that you have to purchase
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.880]   when you, when you buy it on the Mac as differently from when you buy it on iPad.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.520]   You know, I, I, I'm all for this.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.200]   I do not want to see because, I mean, we, we say this all the time.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.520]   If you're getting it for free, it means they're, they're using something, they're, they're
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.080]   getting their money somewhere.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.400]   And usually that means it with our data.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.120]   So let's not make that mistake here.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:46.040]   Let's not, you know, create an environment where people expect apps to be free or cheap
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.360]   on the Mac store because the exchange for that is that they're going to start collecting
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.840]   data from our computers.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.480]   Do we, do we want that even worse than we already have?
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   I don't think so.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:58.040]   I think we should pay for those apps and be happy to support these developers so that
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.440]   they can continue doing what they do.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.600]   So good.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.240]   You guys excited November 1st Apple TV plus appears.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.200]   It is now available on the Roku.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.200]   My God.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.480]   I mean, it's like iTunes on Windows all over it.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.480]   What's that?
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.800]   That's a, that's a stunner.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.400]   And apparently you'll be able to play it.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.960]   The movies and TV shows that you bought on iTunes on a Roku using the Apple TV plus app.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   It's going to be, is it, have you.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.600]   Samsung televisions, Visio to, I used the Samsung and Visio television apps.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.880]   The Samsung app is built in.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.520]   So basically it just looks like the TV app.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.280]   You go on the TV set, the TV app pops up.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.280]   You can tell it what you want to watch and you start watching it.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.080]   The Visio ones are all air play right now.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.960]   I think Samsung has an exclusive on the built in app, but it works the same.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.760]   You go to the TV app on your phone, you press a button, you have the interface on your phone
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.000]   and it takes over the screen.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.360]   And then essentially at that point, it works like the TV app and you just press a few buttons
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.360]   and it starts to play.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.000]   Is it going to be the way, like the way it is on the Mac though where you, you can't,
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.240]   you have to subscribe inside the app if you want to, you know, watch Netflix or, or something
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.240]   like that.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:14.360]   And now I can't even use the Apple TV app on my Mac except for to watch the movies that
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:20.000]   I've purchased from iTunes because it's asking me to try, like try out like a trial subscription
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.440]   even for services that are already subscribed to.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.440]   And I don't want to get.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.320]   So they don't have different apps.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.880]   So this is where this whole thing breaks down.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.480]   It's like you can subscribe to Apple music or Spotify and get like all music, but there's
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.000]   everything in video is still a Fyftum.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   So all app, all the Apple TV app really does is Apple content.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.480]   They cheat on the Apple TV and the TV apps on iOS by in two ways, one with channels, which
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.280]   lets you subscribe to other services inside Apple TV.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.480]   But those services don't let you use it in their apps then you have to subscribe separately
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:54.240]   if you want to use in their apps and vice versa and Netflix won't play with them at
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240]   all.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:58.280]   So like there's just no way to get Netflix content inside that.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.320]   But on the other platforms like the Mac, there is no CBS all access.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.440]   There is no apps for those things.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.640]   Even when there is, I imagine it will be similar.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:09.680]   It will just show up in the TV app if they decide to play nicely with it and have that
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.240]   back and forth conduit.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.680]   And then they're still going to make you subscribe to everything everywhere because they hate
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.680]   us.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.480]   So yeah, so my question is, is that how it is on Roku right now, which I know I don't
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.680]   actually have their own apps.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.080]   So they have separate apps for those.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.240]   So they will have a separate Netflix app.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.880]   Yeah, although they won't play nicely with TV with the TV app at all, though they'll be
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   separate apps.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.840]   You have to exit the TV app, go to Netflix, exit TV app, go to CBS, all access, exit the TV.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:36.080]   So there's still reason to get an Apple TV if you want a unified experience.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.080]   It sounds like.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.560]   And all the Apple Arcade and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.720]   Arcade won't go.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   That's right.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:50.080]   Apple is continuing to ramp up its efforts for Apple TV plus November 1st, a bunch of shows
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.080]   will launch.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.640]   They've signed a deal now with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to do the third part of their
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.560]   band of brothers trilogy.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.800]   You remember they did band of brothers when a bunch of Emmys, then they did the Pacific
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.200]   one, a bunch of Emmys.
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:10.520]   The third part follows the eighth Air Force and Apple has apparently snagged this away
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.280]   from HBO.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:17.480]   Masters of the air will be on Apple TV plus starting to look a little bit more appealing.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:22.120]   I thought band of brothers was one of the best TV shows ever made.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.200]   So this will be interesting.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:31.520]   And Stephen King's favorite book, Lise's story will be an eight episode mini series.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:39.040]   Stephen King will write all eight episodes he'll executive produce and it will start
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.760]   Clive Owen and Julianne Moore.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:41.760]   I didn't have it.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.760]   Has anybody read Lise's story?
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.280]   I don't even know that one.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.280]   Not.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.720]   No, it's not one of his most famous.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.360]   He said, Lise's story is my favorite of the books.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.520]   And I would love to see that done, especially now that there's a kind of openness on the
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.960]   streaming services on TV and even the cable networks.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.960]   There's more freedom to do stuff now.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.880]   And when you do a movie from a book, there's this thing I call the sitting on the suitcase
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:03.880]   syndrome.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.320]   That's where you try to pack in all the clothes at once and the suitcase won't close.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:11.480]   It's hard to make a two hour movie out of it or whatever.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:17.280]   But he says, as a TV show, you've got 10 hours.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.920]   You can really stretch out and get the whole book in there.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.400]   That's pretty exciting.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.760]   So you probably, we all have free, I would have guessed, everybody watching has a free
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.640]   year of Apple TV.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.520]   Plus if you buy any Apple device, you're pretty much going to get it.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.880]   What's the cheapest thing you could buy?
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.680]   I guess it'd be an Apple TV.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080]   And then you could get it.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.440]   We're an iPod touch, I forget which one's actually cheaper.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   Or you could.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.440]   Probably Apple TV still.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.440]   You could, I mean, don't be so cheap.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.440]   It's only five bucks a month.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:46.440]   It's not.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.600]   That's the cheapest way to get Apple TV.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.320]   Just pay for it.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   All right.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320]   I think that.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.720]   Well, can we talk about if we're going to talk about it?
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.720]   Can we talk about Apple TV?
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:05.400]   Plus can we talk about Disney Plus and how they just blasted Twitter with 300 movies
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.640]   and TV shows that they're going to add?
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.960]   Oh, wait a minute now.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:09.960]   I'm excited.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:10.960]   Yeah, tell me.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:15.560]   I have no reason at all to get Disney Plus except, except we were talking about it on
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.040]   iOS today, the new Jeff Goldblum show.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.040]   Oh, I know.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040]   That might do it, Lorian.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.720]   Jeff Goldblum is the Mandalorian?
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.320]   No, it's like Jeff Goldblum traveling the world.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.360]   Jeff Goldblum's world, I think, is what it's called.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.880]   Yeah, I think that's it.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   It looks pretty funny.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:39.520]   But yesterday morning, they just started blasting out on Twitter literally every TV show or
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.680]   movie that they're going to show or have at launch.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.680]   I think it was at launch.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:47.560]   It might have just been in general, but I think it was at launch.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:55.960]   They started from their most recent stuff and went all the way back to like 1934.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:56.960]   If you know what they're looking at.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.960]   Laid-new in the tramp, live action.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.320]   Of course, Star Wars, all the Star Wars.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.360]   And oh, man, they do have a lot of content, don't they?
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.840]   Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:15.160]   I grew up watching Disney live action as well as movies.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.400]   And I love like the computer war tennis shoes and, you know, Dobby Gillis and the little
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.400]   people.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.800]   Like to me, those are like charming escape from one's mouth.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.840]   So here's a video of basically everything coming to Disney Plus in the USA.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:34.840]   You've got your snow.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.840]   Three hours and 17 minutes long.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:39.760]   Oh, it is rather long, isn't it?
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.760]   I put it on yesterday.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.760]   Did you watch it?
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.480]   And it's on the background the entire time.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.480]   That's hysterical.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.200]   And they just announced that Kevin Feihe not only is going to be doing one of the Star
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.760]   Wars movies, but he's taking over as head of all of Marvel's entertainment products,
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.520]   which I think is good news.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.320]   Here's the super cut of all three hours in one second and a half.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.320]   So if--
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.320]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.320]   You get to save you a little time.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.320]   It does.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.320]   It has to.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.320]   It has to.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   Wow.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.000]   The poor intern ought to put that together.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.680]   I have no children at home.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:21.040]   I see no reason to get Disney Plus, except now maybe I do.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.680]   I have no children at home.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.680]   Here's the Jeff.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.840]   You want to see the Jeff Goldblum?
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.240]   Let me turn on my sound.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.160]   He's so funny.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.560]   He's so weird, but that's why we love him.
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.160]   Oh, that's it.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.960]   I'm just sorry that he's been Christopher Walkand.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:46.920]   He's gone from this really cool, interesting actor to now he's basically hired to be Jeff
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.280]   Goldblum and just basically hired to be--
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.280]   Weird.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.280]   He's great.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.680]   He's actually a little to the left of Christopher Walk.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.360]   He's really kind of becoming the Gary Busey of--
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.520]   --a little too far down the weird road.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.280]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.360]   When we come back, you're picks of the week.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.480]   So cue them up while I tell everybody about the Epson Eco Tank printers.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.960]   If you print, you'd be crazy to use anything else.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.840]   Kiss expensive ink cartridges.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]   Goodbye.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.040]   Epson's Eco Tank wireless color all in one super tank printers come with a ridiculous
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.040]   amount of ink.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.040]   Enough to print thousands of pages.
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.080]   You've got to two years of ink in the box.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.040]   And then when you get to the store in, what are that, 2021 to buy another set of ink, and
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.040]   these are great bottles.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.320]   They're keyed, so you can't put them in wrong.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.320]   They never spill.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.320]   It's very simple.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.040]   Look at Shaq and do it.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.720]   When you go back to the store to get more ink, you'll get another two years of ink with
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.160]   your replacement bottles.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.120]   So you could say, all right, thanks very much.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.520]   You'll see in 2023, with super-sized, easy to fill tanks, Eco Tank printers mean fewer
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.640]   trips to the store, less frustration at you.
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.040]   And by the way, these are great printers.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.040]   Really good.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.040]   I use them to scan.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.040]   I use them to fax.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.960]   I use them to copy.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   Of course, I use them to print.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.600]   The color is beautiful.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.240]   Epson wants your printing experience to be stress-free and easy.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.800]   That's why they made these Eco Tanks.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.840]   They changed the world of printing.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.400]   And I think they deserve so much credit for doing this.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.800]   I'm sure it was a little scary at the time.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.200]   But man, the reception has been phenomenal.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.440]   Get the compact Eco Tank printer for your home or office so you can do like Shaq does
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.680]   and just fill and chill.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:37.880]   Check out the Epson Eco Tank printers at Best Buy, at Staples or online.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.560]   The Epson.com/ecotankleo.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:45.120]   Epson EPSON-EPSON.com/ecotankleo.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.280]   Transform the way your home or office prints and do away without a vinc frustration for
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.360]   the best combination of ease and value turn to the Epson Eco Tank printers.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.840]   EPSON.com/ecotankleo.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.760]   Eco Tank printers.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.760]   Just fill and chill.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.640]   Epson, exceed your vision.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.040]   Lori Gill has come back to her seat because she has run off to pick up her pick of the
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.280]   week and her Nintendo Switch.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   Yes.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:22.280]   So when Nintendo first announced the Ring Fit Adventure, I didn't really think much of
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280]   it.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.280]   If you know me, you know that I hate to exercise.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   And even things like...
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.280]   I'm with you.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.280]   I'm with you, girlfriend.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.280]   I hate it.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.800]   Even exercising with the game.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.960]   It's like it's still exercise.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.960]   I still hate it.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:35.960]   I just don't want to do it.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:41.120]   I ended up watching the video that they put out on YouTube on how to use it.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.720]   And just thought, "You know, this is actually a little more interesting than I first thought.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.720]   I want it.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.200]   So I went ahead and ordered it."
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.280]   So it's the Nintendo Switch version of Wii Fit.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.960]   It's a new adventure doing new things, using a new controller to exercise.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.760]   You hold this ring and you attach your Joy-Cons to it.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.800]   And you can either run in plays or you can do stretches or you can pretend like you're
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:15.040]   shooting an arrow and you actually have these interactive games that you do.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.480]   It's not just you exercising and earning points for exercising.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.920]   You're playing a story-based adventure and fighting monsters and things like that all
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.920]   while...
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920]   That's actually what's really cool.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:32.280]   So I'm not going to say that it's going to get me fit because I really do hate to exercise.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.760]   But I went ahead and bought it just in case.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.960]   What if it's revolution...
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.200]   What if I suddenly got all these games and you're going to...
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.480]   Wow, you look so buff and I'll be like, "Oh, it's my ring fit adventure."
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.480]   So we'll see.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.280]   It comes out on the 18th.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280]   I just ordered it.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.280]   Thank you.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.720]   It's not cheap, it's $79, $80, but you get the ring.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.720]   So...
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.000]   The controller and the game that comes along with the software that comes along with it.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.960]   So it's about average for their fitness version of games.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.560]   And they're on their systems, so it's a good price.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.440]   It's reasonable for what it is.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440]   Nice.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.160]   I ordered it because I would use this.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.160]   And Michael, our son, who's 16, he really is trying to work out more.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.200]   He loves his switch.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   He plays with a switch all the time.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.720]   Maybe I'll just leave it lying around and maybe he'll pick it up.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.000]   He won't even know it's exercise.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.680]   If you start exercising, Leo, you and I can compete with each other for our stats.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.120]   Oh, it shares that?
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.600]   Only your stats.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.040]   You don't actually play the game with each other, but you can kind of compete for your
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.280]   high scores basically by sharing your stats with your friends.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.120]   I find that very motivating.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.880]   Megan keeps sending me that she just, on her Apple Watch, that she just finished a workout.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.360]   It's like, "Hah!"
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   "Hah!"
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.360]   "Hah!"
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.840]   Then I look and see that it was a three-minute workout.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:51.840]   So...
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.440]   She does a lot of very short workouts.
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   So I don't feel so bad.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:59.240]   Andy and I go, "Your pick at the week."
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.320]   My pick at the week is kind of an interesting one.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:08.480]   It's an app called Notion that a lot of people have heard of, but a lot of people haven't.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:15.120]   The best way to describe it is that imagine you combined a Markdown text editor and a
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.560]   wiki and a database in a way that would allow you to basically create a custom workspace
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.680]   for any project or anything that you've got going, whether it's you working on something
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.920]   alone or you've got something that you've got a whole team of people working on.
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.120]   And it can be more specific than that, but because it really is something that you use
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.480]   to create your own solutions.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:41.960]   So for instance, the sort of thing that it's really good at solving it, when I create my
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:47.040]   stuff for the radio show, it starts off as a list of links and stories that I've been
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.360]   collecting over the past week or two.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:56.720]   And then I do that wonder list and then I use another app to create like a briefing paper
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.720]   for the host of the show.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.280]   And then I use Google Docs to create just some cheat sheets for me to when I'm actually
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.280]   doing it.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.560]   I've always wanted to turn the stuff into like blog post individually.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:11.200]   And so we're talking about four or five apps normally, but I Notion, I could create one
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.440]   entire one workspace that integrates all that stuff together where when I'm grabbing
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.920]   URLs, they automatically go into Notion and each one becomes its own separate page.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.520]   And then I could set, I could create a database of these things that automatically reflect
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   themselves into other pages that I've created for status.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:33.320]   And I could create a homepage for, I'm talking about more in the case of a desktop rather
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:39.080]   than like a web homepage to when I every time I go into the office in the morning, here's
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.040]   my the status of these projects and my work.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.160]   If you look at some of the sample projects that have been done in Notion, we're talking
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:50.320]   about super, super complex things like people who are running podcast with videos that they've
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:56.600]   got teams of editors and teams of people who are doing B roll and teams of camera people.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:00.080]   But it's all these individual documents and all these databases of things that have to
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:03.800]   be tracked, projects that have to be done one step at a time, sponsors that have to be lined
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.440]   up, ad reads for all these sponsors.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.120]   Rather than having these in eight, nine, 10 different apps, they've created this one thing
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.560]   in Notion that allows everybody all across the world on the team to collaborate on this
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.160]   one thing to find out where they're going, what they need to do.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:26.240]   It's the upside of it is that once again, you create a really complicated solution to
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.960]   simplify something that is repetitive and usually flows across immense piles of different
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.480]   apps and different ranges of people.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.120]   The bad thing is that it's not the sort of thing where it's super, super easy to get
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.120]   started with.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:46.080]   You really have to have an idea of what problem you want to solve before you really start sitting
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.080]   down.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.280]   If you just create a free account, I mean, you can write and mark down and link between
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.440]   pages and be saving bookmarks and stuff like that.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:57.920]   But that's not really anywhere near the power of what you can do with it.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.320]   So I've been playing with it.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:04.360]   Again, the good news is that the more I work with it, the more I sense that if I keep with
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:10.400]   it, in months, I could create a super sophisticated tool that turns everything that is repetitive
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:17.800]   and everything that is really not very well work flowed into a single, like an arrow being
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.520]   shot from a bow.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:22.840]   Here is how this radio show gets done every single week.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:27.720]   The bad news is that I try to do the first show with it a couple of weeks ago and it
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.640]   really let me down.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.400]   There's so many little details of this app that don't work really well.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.120]   I thought that, "Well, all I'm going to do with this is that I'm going to write my briefing
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.840]   papers in this because it's a markdown.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:41.840]   That's great."
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.800]   It let me get used to how this thing works.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.800]   And then great.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:46.800]   Okay.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.000]   I got a half hour to just email this to the producer before I catch my train.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.720]   That should take what a minute.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   And it's like, "No.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.720]   Okay.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.720]   Can I do a select all?"
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.320]   No, because select all is only going to select one paragraph.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.320]   Okay.
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.680]   So we'll do an export HTML.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:04.400]   Well, it's now giving me a zip file that when I expand the zip file, I see nothing that
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.600]   is an HTML file inside there.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.480]   And there's a lot of what I call Steve Jobsing going on at my side of the keyboard as in,
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:12.680]   "This is a piece of crap.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.880]   You should be ashamed of yourself for writing this."
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:20.840]   And then it took me a while before my train to figure out exactly how to do what I needed
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:21.920]   to make it to do.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.280]   So don't think that it's like, don't think it's like media edit or don't think it's like
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.800]   a simple markdown editor where you can immediately get in and start doing things with it.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.120]   You do have to sort of learn.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:34.760]   But fortunately, there are piles and piles of YouTube videos about it.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.120]   The least useful ones are just people who want to brag about how nice their own work,
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.960]   their own notion like workspaces are instead of actually telling you how they did it and
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.880]   didn't give you like basic instructions.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.360]   But there are lots of actually helpful instructions.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:54.160]   So I would say that anybody who has to do repetitive stuff that involves integrating
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:59.800]   and creating stuff in multiple apps, this could be a good solution for you.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.040]   And if you've got teams of people that are working together, no matter where they're
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.640]   located, that you wanted them to be able to sort of collaborate in this workspace as though
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.120]   it were a wiki or as though it were an actual web page, that's another reason for you to
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.520]   take a look at this and think that maybe the reason why you're wasting a lot of your time
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.760]   and energy that's being spent managing the project could be spent just simply creating
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:25.760]   this workspace, refining it, and then it just runs on itself.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:29.560]   Do you think I can get a good sense of what it can do with the free version?
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:36.760]   It's in the free version that you do, I think that a thousand elements, I think there are
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:41.960]   a couple of top tier stuff that you can't do like enterprise level stuff with it.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.360]   At higher levels, that would be the sort of stuff where you've got where you've got like
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.960]   permanent employees, but then you also got contract employees coming in and coming out
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.560]   and adding to this project and doing certain work and contributing certain things.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:00.320]   That's, but the free tier is fine and perfect for figuring out what it can do and maybe
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.160]   even building really, really useful solutions to it.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.160]   The only, the only, the other bad thing about it, or excuse me, sorry, the solution that
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:12.920]   I haven't been able to figure out yet is that it really wants an internet connection.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:18.120]   That if you go in, if you go in offline mode, it will kind of work, but I can, can't figure
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.240]   out what I'm going to have access to and what I'm not going to have access to because your
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.160]   data is hosted on notion servers, which is powerful because it means that again, it's
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.400]   sort of like you've got a central repository, like a sort of a private Google Docs that
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:32.880]   other people can contribute to.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:37.400]   The bad thing is that if I'm on a, if I'm on a commuter train on my way to do this radio
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:42.280]   show and I don't have wifi and I've already used up on my, on my mobile broadband on
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:46.640]   my phone and just realized that, oh, okay, so I can't really get at the stuff that I need
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.440]   to get at, this is going to be fun.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.480]   So I'm, I'm trying to give you a realistic idea of the walls you might find yourself
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.640]   butting your head against.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.640]   So if you're not surprised by it, maybe you'll stick with it because if you just, if you,
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.720]   if you all you do is you, you, you sign up for an account and it's been a lot of time
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.560]   just looking at a magic show videos of people showing what they're doing with notion, it
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.040]   might give you some inspiration that while this could be a solution to a lot of problems
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.040]   that I have.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.040]   I don't have to try it.
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:18.960]   I'm using something similar called Joplin which does synchronize so it works offline.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.400]   But, but I love wiki.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.520]   I think wiki, if I, you know, I've looked at tiddly wiki, there are lots of ways to do
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.520]   that.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.880]   But this looks really, really cool.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.960]   And there is a free tier.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:34.960]   I have, I put our notes for our vacation in Joplin to share with my wife so she can
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:38.800]   know what we're doing any given day and what reservations we have and all that stuff.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.600]   But this looks like it'd be really perfect for that too for a travel, travel lab journal
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.560]   planning ahead.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.040]   Notion, really interesting.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.520]   And it's a cross platform which is important for me.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.520]   Yup, cross platform.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.960]   They're also mobile apps and you can actually, and you can just simply throw a web browser.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.600]   So no matter what people have, they'll be able to use it.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.560]   Even works on Windows, notion.s.o.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.160]   If you want to know more, Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.240]   Just a quickly second Andy's pick there.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.440]   I saw a bunch of productivity.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.640]   YouTuber has mentioned it like Thomas Frank and I started looking at it and it looks really
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.520]   snazzy, especially for all sorts of different workflows.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:17.000]   Yeah, I've signed up for the free tier just to play with it.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.080]   And yeah, this looks really good.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.560]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.560]   Okay.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.880]   So this is part of my dastardly attempt to get Leo back into the Pokemon Goful.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:30.040]   I'm highlighting the fall events.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:32.400]   So they've had their ups and downs.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:38.000]   They've had some curious bugs and issues, but they seem to be fixing them.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.840]   So what they're doing is really interesting and really cute.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.600]   So first over Halloween, you'll be able to get the starter Pokemon in these delightful
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.840]   little costumes like Pikachu and a Mimicew suit and Charmander in a Cubone suit.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.000]   Just very cute.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.760]   Very, very, you can get the shiny forms of them too.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.320]   They're also going to have Dark Rye, who's the best dark type in the game, is going to
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.080]   be in five star raids for the holidays, for the first right for Thanksgiving, double candy
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:07.920]   for catching, for hatching, for transferring, for transferring.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]   A lot of stuff going on there.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.880]   They're also having their first virtual event, which is interesting because up until now,
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:18.840]   they've had Gofest in Chicago and Safari Zone in Montreal and different events in different
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.800]   parts of the world, but you had to get a ticket and go there in order to take part in it.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.200]   Now they're having an event that's virtual.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:26.200]   It's still you have to get a ticket.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.160]   I think tickets cost seven bucks or eight bucks US.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:33.200]   But when you get it, it's the same day for everybody in the world.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.360]   You start off and it's a colossal adventure.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:42.080]   And at the end, you get Reggie Giggas, who's this giant Reggie Pokemon character.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:45.560]   But you have a series of little adventure tasks to do before you get them.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.320]   And you also get 10 free raid passes.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.400]   So they try to give you some value for your money.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.960]   But just there's so many people who do travel for these things, but even more people who
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.640]   can't travel for them.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.160]   So I think it's really cool to see that they're doing, it's a virtual company.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.760]   The whole point of it is to be virtual.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.520]   And I get that getting everyone together in the real world is usually appealing, but
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:08.120]   there's just so many more people who can take part in the virtual world.
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.120]   So I was really happy.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.480]   And you don't have to buy if you don't, if you don't pay for it, you'll have a chance
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:16.440]   to get them through the X-rays is going to be the new X-ray boss for the next year going
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440]   forward.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.280]   So you don't, the paying for it now just means you get it first, but also you get the
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.880]   little adventure along the way.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:30.480]   Lisa would be very happy if I went back to Pokemon Go, especially considering we're
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.200]   about to travel all over the place.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.200]   Maybe I will.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.720]   It's doing better than Harry Potter is Leo.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.520]   I stopped playing Wizard's Unite.
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.320]   I was very disappointed.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.320]   How about you, Laurie?
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.480]   You still playing Wizard's Unite?
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.480]   No, I stopped.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:45.960]   It wasn't that interesting.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.960]   It just repented.
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:54.120]   No, I actually really enjoyed it, but they were doing events that were happening so fast.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:57.120]   And I think I've mentioned before, I'm a bit of a completionist.
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:02.160]   And the first two times that I couldn't complete these events, I just thought I can't
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.760]   because I can't keep up with this.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:09.520]   And if I can't get everything, then I have this sort of, I'm taking my ball and going
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.520]   home.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.520]   I don't want to play anymore.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.320]   Oh, so you went off and took off in a half.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.320]   In a half.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.320]   In a half.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.320]   In a half.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320]   A minute.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320]   Too many events too fast.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:22.640]   All right, well, I'm firing up Pokemon Go again, I guess, for a victory.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.640]   You did it, Renee.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:24.640]   You got him.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:26.640]   Yay.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.240]   Well, Lisa still plays.
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:29.240]   Yes.
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.440]   And she's always mad at me because I don't raid with her.
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:35.480]   So I guess for vacation, I should play, right?
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:39.240]   That's your gift to her, yeah.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.240]   No, I promise.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.120]   No Simpsons tapped out.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:45.240]   And actually in our new Twit forums, Twit.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:47.840]   That community, somebody said, I don't know.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:49.560]   You haven't played Clash of Clans in years.
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.520]   Remember, John, we were like crazy over Clash of Clans.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.520]   The Twit.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:57.920]   The Twit army clan is still around and he's running it.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.240]   He says, anytime, anytime we're here.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.840]   Oh, man.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.000]   No, no, no.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000]   I won't.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000]   I can't.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000]   I'm not.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.800]   Thank you for doing such a great job at Vector.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.720]   Go to imore.com/vector.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:15.560]   Renee covers the all the, you know what?
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:18.400]   It's kind of the point now where if it's not on imore, I don't trust it.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.040]   So thank you for the great job you're doing.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:26.680]   @ReneeRitchie on the Twitter and imore.com/vector for the Vector Podcast.
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:27.680]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.320]   Lori Gill, also from imore.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:33.160]   She's managing editor over there, @appaholic on the Twitter.
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:38.760]   And catch her and her band, Sickburn, at a venue near you.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.600]   When's the world tour?
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.760]   We actually are going to Japan at the end of November.
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.760]   Sickburn.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:50.160]   What is that Japanese venue kiss played?
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:52.600]   What do they call that?
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.600]   The Budakan.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.760]   Are you going to go Sickburn at the Budakan?
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.760]   That would be awesome.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.400]   Sickburn live at the Budakan.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.120]   All right, I'm counting on that, Lori.
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.160]   Andy Inako, he is with Boston Public Radio.
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:11.440]   He has a Pixel 4 and he's not afraid to use it.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:15.280]   Go out to the Boston Commons there and look for him in the squirrels.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.920]   When will you be on WGBH this week?
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:19.880]   Unfortunately, this week is pledge week.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:24.000]   So they don't until they bump my segment, but I'm going to be on next Friday.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.720]   So the Boston Public Library probably at around noon.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.760]   I still, but you're touching on a sore spot.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:35.280]   Twice, I've tried to go out and take my squirrel demo pictures with the iPhone 11 twice I've
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.520]   been thwarted.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:41.440]   So I've got to really make sure I set a whole day aside to make sure that I test the rigors
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:43.640]   of the iPhone 11 and now the Pixel 4 as well.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:48.640]   Warded by home, the Boston Police Department is squirrels.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:54.320]   I feel as though I have an obligation and a duty to make sure that for people who are
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.280]   taking pictures of, not just squirrels, but any small jittery mammals that will not listen
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.720]   to you when you say, "We just stop and let me take you a nice picture of you for grandma."
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:10.240]   Okay, yes, I shouldn't be sending pictures of squirrels to my mother's mother.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.560]   So, but still.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.560]   She likes those squirrel pictures.
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.360]   By the way, Lisa, who took a walk in the Commons because she was in Boston, we were all in Boston
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:24.320]   for the last pass event a couple of weeks ago, said, "I couldn't believe how many squirrels."
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:32.160]   Yeah, there are very, very few natural predators and lots of people feeding them high-fed foods.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:36.000]   They mostly die of strokes and heart disease rather than predators.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.680]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.680]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680]   Thank you, Laurie.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.680]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:43.520]   We do Mac Break Weekly Tuesdays right after iOS today.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:47.000]   It's kind of an Apple Fest here at the Twitch Studios.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.400]   It's supposed to be 11 a.m. Pacific, usually about noon.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:53.640]   That would be 3 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.360]   You know, it would be about, what is that?
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:00.400]   100, something like that.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.400]   I don't know.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:02.400]   You figure it out, UTC.
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.240]   It's all going to change in a month anyway.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:05.240]   I want to do the math.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:06.240]   It's too hard.
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:07.400]   I will not be here for the next few weeks.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:12.960]   I'm going on vacation, but don't worry, Mac Break Weekly will always be here.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.520]   You can tune in live at Twitch.tv/live.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:19.000]   If you do that, join us in the chatroom at IRC. Twitch.tv.

[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.920]   If you subscribe, you don't have to worry about any of that.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.520]   It just appears magically on your device.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:36.040]   The minute it's available, so go to your favorite podcast application and subscribe.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.200]   If you are listening offline, by the way, the Twitch community is a great place to go
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.880]   to continue the conversation.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.600]   You put all the shows up there and you can talk about it.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.600]   Introduce yourself.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:49.280]   If you join us, Twitter.community in the web.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:55.400]   If you're on iOS, Discord, Hub also will work, but you have to enter www.twitch.community
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:56.400]   in there.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.400]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:01.560]   Now it's time to go back to work because break time is over.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:04.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:06.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.620]   [upbeat music]
