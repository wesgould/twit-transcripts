[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   This is Detroit.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Bandwidth for MacBreak Weekly is provided by
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   cashfly@cachiefly.com.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   This is MacBreak Weekly, Episode 62, for October 16, 2007.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Mac404.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   [music]
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly in a big news week this week.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Fortunately we have a team to match, joining us
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   from his furry headquarters deep within the mountainside,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   where all the chimps and hamsters lie.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I bet you think I'm going to say Macelope, I'm talking about Scott Bourne.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   It's the Macelope ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Hello Mr. Macelope.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Hello.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   We're here so that you and the Buffant of Knowledge can fight it out.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And duke it out.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Fisticuffs.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Okay.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   No, it's great to have you.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Thank you for joining us once again.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's great to be here.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   We figured that that article you wrote last week was just because you were sad that you hadn't
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   been asked to join us again.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   The entire the whole blog is a desperate cry for attention.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   That's what I thought.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But isn't every blog?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Yes, true.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Let's be honest.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Let's be frank.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I know mine is.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I know Devorex is.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Also here Scott Bourne from the Apple Phone Show and many other news shows including
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Geeks, girls, geek girls, say what is it?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   GirlsGoneGeek.tv which rolled all the way to number one on the technology list.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Top 40 today on iTunes.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Congratulations.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Big success.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He's not on it by the way.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   No, I'm just the executive producer and creator.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   He's not a girl geek.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I'm the Charlie and they're the angels.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Despite what you might think, he is not the girl geek.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So that's fun.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And congratulations on your success with that.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's wonderful.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You're really doing great stuff.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I have to say.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Well, we're just trying to satisfy the problem.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I caught ADD from Alex in that.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I got nothing else to do.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I think so.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Between you and me and Alex, I think we have 98% of all podcasts produced.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   98% of all podcasts.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You're adding PR and that's it.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Chris Breen is also here from the Apple Phone Show.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He's also the Apple 911.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Mac 911.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   What are those numbers?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   One of them numbers.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Popcorn at Macworld.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Hey, Chris.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah, call me and I'll give you the time.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's what we need.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's 1114 and 76.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We need a popcorn for magazine popcorn.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Three months ago, it was 1119.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   That'd be great.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Oh, that's just a little inside the baseball there.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Hello.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Hello, Mr. Lindsey.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Are you home or are you on the road?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm a thousand ups.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   To your beautiful to you.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yes.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   At a lovely hotel there.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   No, actually I'm in an office from a company that I'm working at, a 3D company called Mac.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We're building a bunch of training and I'm working on a bunch of stuff with them.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So I'm in between meetings.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Okay, well, tell them to stop using the internet.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You're starting to sound like Madamackalope.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Andy Enochko is here also.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   This is a huge panel from the ColossalWasteOfBanWith.com and the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I'm not sure which is greater.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Hello, Andy.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm also the author of Mac 404 where you ask me questions and I simply don't answer them.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I can't find it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I know it's here somewhere.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I stopped doing the Q&A column in Mac user.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I've been doing this uninterrupted since 1997.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Now celebrating our 10th anniversary of Mac 404.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   People rely on me for no answers.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Like a lot of people that I can look up to.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Do you ever waste Chris Breen?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   You could just stop answering people's questions.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Sometimes I wish I could stop answering the same question over and over again.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And that question is, why isn't my Mac working?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Wait, I have to answer.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Be glad you don't have to answer Windows questions.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   No, no, thank God I don't have to do that.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I would not like to be in your shoes however you did answer them with a plumb I think.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And wasn't your answer re-install Windows and get back?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You know, I used to mock Microsoft because really if you called the Microsoft support line,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   that was always their answer.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Just well re-install.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And it is if you call most vendors as well because they wanted to get it back to a known state
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   mixture.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It's not their hardware.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And I said, I'll never do that.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But that's frankly the only answer to 90% of the Windows questions now.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's gotten so darn complicated.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It's not like you can open the hood and you know, oh, I'll just fix this little thing here and everything will work.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, eventually you're going to get there anyway.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I mean, it's going to be there going to work on it for two days.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And finally, that's okay.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I've done everything now.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   What do I do?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Well, I'll do what I initially suggested.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Well, I think come October 26th, the few of us are going to be doing some re-installs.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's the date now.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Apple's officially said it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Actually went online today at apple.com that leopard will officially come out.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So everybody was right.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   All the rumor sites said yes, the 26th.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Macelope, you were the one who was saying we were asking too much of leopard.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   My point was that it seems like there are not going to be any surprises from here on out.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Well, it's been two in the demos for two years.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's been the same demo two years in a row largely.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And if you're looking for surprises, you're probably going to be disappointed.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Have you been running?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Show of hands.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Who's been running the beta?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Macelope, you've been running the beta?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I have played with it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I've not running it myself.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Chris Breen, you're probably running it, right?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Alex Lindsay, I know you're not.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   No.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Scott Borne, I know you wouldn't.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The only way I'll have leopard is if it comes on my new machine.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You'd rather run Windows than run the beta.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Yeah, well, that's not, that's going a little far.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   No, that's going a little too far.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And we know Andy's been using it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So, Andy, Chris...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Well, I've had it installed on my MacBook for four months.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Having it installed and actually being able to use it, those are two very, very separate things.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Very sadly, just last week I wound up, the latest seed wound up disabling my MacBook twice,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   which really left me in a very, very pleased state of mind.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Unfortunately, this isn't terribly unusual for development seeds.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   My usual modus operandi is that when it comes to the dev copies of operating systems,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   you start by just very racing everything and doing a fresh install every single time.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Unfortunately, sometimes you just don't have four, five, six hours to do a backup
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and then restore everything and then do a fresh install.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So, the tried saying, "Well, look, we're really, really close to Goldmaster.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I bet I can just do a regular install."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Has the Goldmaster...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Is this this last version that's gone out?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Is that the Goldmaster or do you have you seen?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I haven't checked as of yesterday.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They've had a seat out that was dated like September 26th.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   There must be one more then.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   There must be one more ready to drop.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I think it's pretty much new that, okay, we're one away,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   so rather than give people eight different things to download,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   let's give them one big memo to get.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I'm hoping this will solve all the problems I'm having.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   The Leopard book just does not want to be written.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   This operating system, at least inside the purple environment of my office,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   it just does not want to run properly.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Oh, goodness.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   The sooner this book is finished, the sooner I can get on with this business of appreciating it.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The world is a good and wonderful place for opportunities that exist for happiness.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   You can write them in skeptical right now.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   The next iPhone book.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   How about you, Chris Breen?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Has it been more reliable for you?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It has been.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   The latest seed was 21st, and then they've done a little update via the software update.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And it has been nice.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I'm not using it on a production machine because it's just not safe to do that.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   But the amount of dickering I've done with it has been pretty good prior to that.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Things were very funky.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I see a lot of duct tape and plywood under there.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   But now I think we're seeing a much more finished surface.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And I think with the GM, we're going to see even more so.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Next week's show, we'll spend some time talking about what to do to get ready for it since
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   it'll be a week from Friday.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I actually canceled my order at Amazon because I want to go into the store.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The stores are opening at six.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So I'll be another chance to wait in line at the Apple Store.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I know we all look forward to that.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   We won't be talking.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   We'll get the education version now, and that'll save you $16.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Is that all?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   13?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   $13.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   Can you imagine the folks that will stand in line at the Apple Store for a copy of Leopard?
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.440]   Can you imagine a number of neckbeards per thousand?
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.000]   You're channeling Merlin now.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Yeah, you have to get a neckbeard joke in.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.360]   Merlin, by the way, I think if you last, listen, last week, you know, but Merlin is taking
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.000]   a little hiatus of a few months to be with his baby, which hasn't come yet.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.160]   Well, like, you know, the minute the baby arrives, but so he's going to take a little time
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   off.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.600]   Of course, naturally, the week he's not here, we've got like the largest panel in history.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.200]   So it's just a good thing.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.520]   He's having a baby.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.600]   So let's, you know, I'm looking at the Leopard page on apple.com.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.040]   And I have to say it's not the most compelling advertisement for Leopard.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.840]   Right on the front there, they have an iBook or MacBook running the new stackable dock.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.240]   And it looks like the Leaning Tower pays it, to be honest with you.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.920]   The icons are starting to fall over.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.640]   Yeah, but that's just one mode.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.840]   I think the most of the people are going to use is the grid mode where you get this nice
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.960]   little like smokey translucent panel that pops up and just populates itself with like
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.200]   slides which are looking at.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   They should show that then.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   I mean, why are they?
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   They're, they're, they're awesome.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.480]   This isn't very compelling.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.520]   This, this tilting tower here.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.600]   Well, I mean, that's, well, that's sort of endemic of this release when they, I think
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.480]   they're doing the right thing by making the number one thing on this page 300 plus new
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.040]   features because this isn't like previous releases where it's like, oh my God, Automator,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.000]   my life begins on today.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.920]   It's more like little things that you're going to like.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.520]   You're going to like the live previews and the finder.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.440]   You're going to like the new cover flow of cover flow motives of looking through folders
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.680]   and things like that.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.960]   They're little tweaks to the dock that you're really going to like.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.160]   It's basically, it's like each one of these little features is going to give you 15 cents
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.840]   worth of your money back.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.200]   And that's still going to be more than you paid for it cumulatively.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   But there isn't that one.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.080]   My God, if Automator, if they charge me 80 bucks for this one feature as a third party
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.240]   app, I would give them a hundred not ask for chain.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   Right.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.320]   So I think that's, I think there's, you're an Apple script guy.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.560]   So yeah, but, but there's, there are a lot of things like that in previous releases.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.080]   I mean, spotlight has its problems, but the ability to just do a quick search like that
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   was wonderful.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.000]   And being able to do smart folders and basically hand off the organization of your, the responsibility
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.600]   for the, of your hard drive to, to just a quick smart folder that simply says anything
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.120]   that looks like a SunTimes column, please alias it into this folder and boom, suddenly
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   everything's already there.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.840]   I think the quick look is going to have a lot of utilitarian value in that, that way.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   It's wonderful.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.280]   When the times when I had a stable leopard release, the leopard, the leopard install
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.640]   of Mac that I had was one of my favorite machines because it's such a common problem where
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.720]   it's like, I just have a folder marked pictures.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   Like, oh, damn, now it's in here.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.040]   And we're, I used to have to have a utility that would drag the folder on to give me a
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.920]   whole bunch of, a whole bunch of previews.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.880]   Now it's just, you know, flip through it.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.480]   Ah, there's that picture of that diner that I was looking for.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   Awesome.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.280]   Macelope, you, you were one of the people who said that don't, you know, don't have too
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.880]   high expectations for leopard.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   Right.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.200]   Well, I mean, I was responding to your comment that it needed to be something as different
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.240]   from, you know, like X, the difference between XP and Vista.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   That's a pretty big difference.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   That's a pretty big difference.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.400]   Although in retrospect, it's not going to be like that.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.440]   Although in retrospect, I have to say, given that it took five years, Vista ain't that
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.200]   different from XP, really.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.800]   Ah, I think leopard may be as different from a Tiger, his XP was in Vista, to be honest,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   but that's more because of Microsoft than because of Apple.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.040]   So you think it's an incremental upgrade is what you're saying.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.000]   And for me, frankly, there's some things that I'm not really looking forward to.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.600]   I mean, I don't think the dock looks as good.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.720]   And I'm a, I like to use double scroll arrows at the bottom and the top of the finder.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.360]   And I'm not even sure if you can do that anymore in this version.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.760]   If you can, I think it doesn't look right.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.520]   So there are a couple of things that I'm, you know, I'm, I'm looking forward to it, but
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.800]   I'm not, I'm not going to be standing in the line on Friday night.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.120]   Alex Lindsey, you've been saying it's stuff under the hood that's the most significant.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   Sorry.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.920]   I have to say that again.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.

[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.

[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   I'm not going to be saying it.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   I like the idea of adding little things to DVD player or the mail.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.480]   To channel Merlin a little bit, the new mail has kind of stickies and to-do lists right
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.480]   there in mail.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.680]   I think that that's going to be the kind of little thing that makes a big difference
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   in how you use your computer.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.920]   Yeah, but do we really have to wait a year or two to get that sort of feature?
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.160]   It's like if we have to wait until the rest of the operating system is ready before we
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.800]   can get tab browsing and Safari wouldn't have been such a great OS.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   And a lot of the stuff that was in Leopard was the new features in, for instance, iChat,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.920]   were really ready to go months ago.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   When I look at a new OS release, I look for things that require all this brand new infrastructure,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   light core animation.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:20.200]   2008 is going to be an awesome year for Mac software because if Windows developers got
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.840]   the hold of these sort of utilities for automatically doing lighting effects and automatically doing
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.280]   3D effects and transitions and stuff like that.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.400]   I mean, everything would look like a really, really bad rip-off of the Zack Sonicard arcade
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   game from 1983.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.040]   It would run it the entire OS even less usable than it is right now.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.040]   But Mac developers are really good at understanding what these new interface things mean.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.120]   We're going to see new user interfaces that look really, really good and make things just
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.880]   so much prettier and more useful more than anything else.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.800]   So you see, Mac-a-lope, this is a big upgrade.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.520]   You just can't see it.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.920]   I'm still not sure that it's still camped out for 12 hours outside of other IT guys without
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.160]   other IT guys for 12 hours.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.640]   I just like those kind of people.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   I don't care.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.160]   I bring my launcher and sit out front of Apple just for no reason.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.720]   I just, I like it.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.320]   If we could convince one, just one out of 10 people who intend to spend their day waiting
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.480]   outside the Apple Store to instead go to their local Red Cross donor center and don't spend
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.280]   that time donating one pineapple and have eight hours left over.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.520]   Oh boy, that would be a much better way to spend your time.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520]   All right.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.400]   Now, how late will the store be open on Friday, a week from Friday?
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   10 o'clock?
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   I'm guessing.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   I'm guessing.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.760]   Find out what it is.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.320]   Don't go at six because you know you're going to wait in line for no apparent reason and
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.520]   then you could walk in at eight anyway.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.720]   So go and donate a pint of blood, then get it.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.520]   You'll be a little lightheaded, but that could be fun.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   Right.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.160]   And there are donor centers reasonably.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.440]   If you're going to a major city to do this, that's the fun time to wait outside with Apple.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.480]   There's probably a donor center within five miles of that mall or that store.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.520]   We should encourage you Red Cross to put vans in front and there's a premium on neck.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.520]   Your blood right now.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.040]   Plus, Apple is Apple really wants you to be have your mask to have your platinum after
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.280]   card and a little bit woozy with blood loss when you step into the store.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.440]   You're already a little bit woozy, but by the sitter, by the air inside that room anyway.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.720]   I think then people I got can can do clever titles or blog posts and stuff about blood
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.520]   letting and leopard being released.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.760]   All right.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   This is it.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.320]   The campaign donate blood, then pick up leopard from now on for any Apple line.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:35.280]   They did do a good page of all 300 new features on one pretty long page.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.200]   And when you and I'm sorry to say when you add them all up, it's not insignificant.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.640]   I mean, obviously the elves have been working.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.800]   I mean, I'm not that I mean to denigrate it by saying that there's no one killer feature
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.560]   in there, but that's that's exactly the point.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.480]   There are just every all these little features that will give you again, 25 cents, 50 cents
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480]   worth of value.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.800]   Well, or there may be one depending on how you use your Mac, there may in fact be a killer
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   feature.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.040]   I think for Alex, you know, core, whatever the core animation updates are might be a killer
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.960]   feature for him.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.560]   I don't want to speak for you, Alex.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.520]   I think it's going to make a huge difference as we start to develop a lot of this stuff
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.280]   by using these new pieces.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.440]   And so I definitely think that that's the price of admission by itself from our point
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   of view.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.800]   And I think that you're going to have different individual people with something like that
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.040]   that's going to make it a big difference.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.800]   But I think that there's not going to be anything that all of us are really really happy.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   No, I agree.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.600]   But I believe in how Vista was like that too.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   That's one of the things that many of the reviews of Vista said, there's no one compelling
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.800]   thing that's going to make you say I've got to have it.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.000]   It's a bunch of different things.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.920]   I think it could be the little thing, for instance, the ability to script, Apple Script
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.160]   P lists could be a huge thing for people.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.400]   They may be, oh, I've been waiting for that capability.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.240]   I mean, my attention is, again, I'm an Apple Script freak.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.920]   And I'm like, oh, I can finally script I chat.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.480]   Could all these hacks that I've been doing that required all this really, really weird
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.320]   user interface scripting.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.600]   You mean that now I can actually simply say, what's the step?
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.840]   Who's online and what's their status right now?
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.080]   And you'll actually tell me.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   Awesome.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.320]   Apple's defense, I think, yeah, sure, they could have shipped an upgrade to iChat.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.560]   They could have shipped an upgrade to mail.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.440]   But piecemeal this out.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.360]   But I think it makes sense to roll it up into one big package for support.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.880]   Maybe not for support reasons.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   And maybe--
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.640]   There are also some features that require like the reason-- one of the reasons why I'm
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.760]   sure that mail got delayed, that they never even considered releasing that as a separate
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.040]   thing, is that now it's part of the ginshiness of mail is now integration with the iPhone.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   Right.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   Right.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.520]   That's the part that's got me excited.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.440]   What particular integration are you looking for to do lists?
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.440]   Just--
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.440]   Go ahead.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   Go ahead.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   Yes, Scott, go ahead.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.080]   I think we're going to see some of the functionality that we've been missing with things like to
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   do lists.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.560]   And I don't want to speak out of turn, but I believe we're going to see almost a whole
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.880]   new app on the iPhone as a result of this not too far off.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.720]   And what app would that be?
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.120]   Well, a combination calendar mail to do list feature that is--
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   It's much needed.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   It's much needed.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.040]   The lack of a to-do list really, really hurts.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.320]   Actually an interesting article in Business Week just came out today, actually, saying
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   they have inside sources familiar with Apple's plans tell businessweek.com that Apple will
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:33.600]   release a software development kit for the iPhone in early 2008, enabling programmers
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.840]   to create games, business productivity tools, and countless other applications for the device.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   That makes sense.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.560]   Well, I believe it's going to be controlled inside.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.160]   Yes, and it'll probably sell it through iTunes, right?
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.440]   Certified applications sold through iTunes.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.000]   And I don't mind that at all.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.840]   I think that's probably a very good idea.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:56.120]   Yeah, I mean, my complaint has always been not so much that there isn't a development
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.960]   kit so much as Apple's not willing to even confirm that they're working on one.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.720]   I mean, I just posted-- on my test blog, I posted like an expanded version of a Sun
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.600]   Times column I wrote last week in which I was able to expand on the controversy that
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.680]   happened a couple of weeks ago about Apple locking out third party apps.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.840]   And it's not really so much about not being satisfied with a really great web-based app,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.960]   so much as not knowing that a year from now or even two months from now that there's going
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.440]   to be a change, that there's going to be a ability to get a really good to-do list,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.400]   a really good productivity app for your iPhone.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.640]   And I think that it's terrible that Business Week has to sort of break this as sort of
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   a sneaky whole.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.360]   We've got sources about-- let's say this.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.600]   And it's not Apple saying, don't worry, we're on this.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.080]   We can't say when it's going to happen, but we assure you that's going to happen.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.680]   We know this is important to you.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.040]   Your $400 is important to us.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.920]   We're going to make it right for you.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.880]   Yeah, and the message seems slightly mixed because it seemed like at the Wall Street
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.600]   Journal conference with Gates--
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   The Decomprens.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.120]   Yeah, the Decomprens.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.920]   Steve seemed to be saying that there was going to be more coming than what he announced at
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.240]   WWDC.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.160]   And then again, Jaws seemed to indicate that they didn't care about their--
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   Right.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   --people installing third-party applications.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   Right.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.320]   So they don't seem to be really on message about this.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   Either they don't have it defined or they've been working in some of the backroom and have
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.720]   exactly figured out how they're going to tell people about it.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.840]   You know, the sense I get-- and I've had a couple of people email me from close meetings
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.400]   with Steve Jobs, companies that are meeting with Steve Jobs about the iPhone.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   And one of the things that I get-- first of all, is a focus on security.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   That's very high.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   But also, I think reading between the lines, I get the sense that Jobs is a little-- that
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.600]   cell phone development was more complicated than they expected.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.440]   Working with a partner like AT&T has been much more difficult than they expected.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.760]   And they're just things they can't do that they would like to do.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:04.160]   The Business Week article quotes Benoit Schillings, the Chief Technology Officer at Trolltech, saying
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.480]   no operator would want to ship a handset that's completely open.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.240]   They-- you know, I'm sure there's pressure from AT&T to be very careful about what Apple
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   adds.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.840]   And that makes sense.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.640]   It's a difficult thing to be developing a cell phone.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.360]   It's a whole new area for Apple.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.000]   And frankly, that was one of the concerns I had when they said they're going to do a
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   cell phone.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.520]   I also wonder if they were really aware of the philosophical implications of doing a cell
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.880]   phone, because it's such a unique beast.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.280]   It's sort of like when newspapers thought that they're going to get into the web business
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.440]   and say, well, we'll just sell monthly or annual subscriptions to our website.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.600]   And we're shocked that this didn't work out, that people didn't actually want that.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.280]   I'm wondering if, to a certain extent, Apple thought, well, great, we'll make an iPod that
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.880]   we can control, that we can sell all the content for.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.960]   And then when they realize that, wait a minute, people actually like having some measure of
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.200]   control over this device, because it's not, they don't think of it as an iPod to think
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.240]   of it as a phone.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:03.560]   I think you're going to see some more mixed messaging, though, because as the Mac a little
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.720]   pointed out, they don't seem to be on message.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.800]   Just this week, they really trumped, they're trumpeted their new page, which lists all the
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.920]   web apps.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.400]   And I had a meeting over the weekend with a company that's been in closed door sessions
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.040]   with Apple on a product that I can't talk about for two more weeks.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.880]   But it's a web-based app that will blow people away, and it's proof that you can do cool web
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   apps.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.800]   But, you know, the Apple was really pushing this company to get that product done in time
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.600]   for that page, as if to say, look, you can do really cool things.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.880]   And yet I don't, I really don't want a Safari page.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.200]   I mean, I just, to me, a Safari app is not a, is not a great app.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   You know, I mean, it's, it's not, it's not the same.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.120]   Well, no, no, there are really great Safari-based apps.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.160]   The problem is that once you board a plane or once you go into a parking garage, or for
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   me, once I enter the state of Vermont, I mean, those apps and the data that I used to command
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   is them, they all go away, and that's just no damn good.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.240]   They're also buried deep within Safari.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.480]   I mean, that's a couple of clicks to get there.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   And that's kind of a pain.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.080]   I do think that having pages is good, but yeah.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.160]   And again, I mean, the thing is when I first heard about this, this attitude towards apps,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.120]   every time that you think about an online app, you think about an app that just does, does
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.400]   a JavaScript currency converter.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.600]   I really wouldn't have predicted that a spreadsheet program served completely via the web would
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.400]   be as rich and as wonderful as these apps that I've been seeing.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   Edit grid.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.080]   I'm sorry, I've only been awake for four hours.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.040]   The name of the name of the edit grid.com to slip my mind for a break.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.280]   And Stan Sigler is retiring from AT&T.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   Maybe they'll change everything.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.080]   Yeah, he's taking his package and packing them up and going home.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.840]   Chris Breen has dropped off and that may be one of the reasons you might have said, "Where's
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   Chris in all this?"
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.280]   "Oh, I'm back now."
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.240]   He's with us and now Alex has dropped off.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.240]   That's okay.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.720]   We have so many panelists that it really works fine.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.120]   I figure we're all just going to take turns and I thought, "Oh, well, it's my turn to go
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   away now."
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.960]   You were all talking about how bad Tron Bonas are and how arrogant they are and that you
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.800]   have been the perfect voice to hear Tron Bonas.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   I hate Tron Bonas.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.600]   I just hate you to come in.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.040]   No, no, no, we're going to get an email from Tron Bonas.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   Like we need that.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   That's all right.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   They're at least seven.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   I say, I don't know.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.440]   So we were talking a little bit about cell phone development and application development for
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:39.080]   the iPhone, Safari apps versus standalone apps and the Business Week article that said
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.800]   basically in early 2008 we'll see an announcement from Apple of third party apps.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.520]   Business Week says it's because they had to wait for leopard.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.520]   Does that make sense, Chris Breen?
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.000]   I'm not so sure.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Honestly, I think that they're going to do exactly what they do with the iPhone and they're
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.720]   going to let a very select few developers in and say, just as they've done with EA on
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.920]   the iPhone and say, "This is how much we're going to give you.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.520]   We're going to give you this little tiny space here.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.080]   Yes, you can do games for us.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.960]   Yes, we'll let you do X, Y, and Z.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.240]   However, the following are not going to be allowed, for example, maybe instant messaging
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.200]   would be one of those."
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   Although I've seen the leopard.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.520]   Again, that's to protect AT&T's profits, not because there's any technical reason why
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   you could do it.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   Exactly.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   Right.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   There already is.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   There are instant messaging clients now if you use the third party app on the phone.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.080]   So it's not that you can't do it.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.120]   It's just that Apple will say, "No, this leads to into our profits or into our relationship
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   with AT&T.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.480]   Therefore, we will not do it."
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.640]   The fact that people have been able to develop third party apps and get them on the phone
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.680]   now makes me question the whole idea of, "No, no, no, we have to wait for leopard because
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.600]   that's going to give us the key because we've already got the key."
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.640]   I just think Apple's facing what we all knew they would face, which is the difficulty
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.040]   of developing for this market.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.440]   It's a very different market than a computer.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.240]   That's one of my questions, though, maybe we should talk about this, because I seem to
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.760]   think that they're trying to target a different market than the existing smartphone market,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.320]   that they're trying to take the smartphone market to the average consumer.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.200]   So my point is, well, is the average consumer really the kind of user that's going to be
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.760]   installing applications on these phones?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.920]   Maybe they don't know they want applications, but I can tell you that if you buy a smartphone,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   you want it to do list.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.400]   You might look at, "Why do I have stocks and weather when all I really want is a to-do
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400]   list?"
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.760]   I think whether you know why or not, whether you know what you really want or not, you're
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.400]   going to be some dissatisfaction there.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.160]   Steve's so good at telling me what I want.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.920]   Well, if we could prioritize what applications need to be added, I think, obviously, Chats
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   the first one.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.520]   I think you're going to come up with eight different answers.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.680]   I know many people that are on the conversation.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.480]   I vote for Chatton to-do list.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   What do you say, Chris Breen?
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   What would you like to see?
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   The first...
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   Games.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   What about games?
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   It's a great gaming platform.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   Yeah, it's a great gaming platform.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.320]   Chats seems to be the first thing that when people saw it wasn't on there, and it may
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.280]   have been that their expectations were too high that when Steve initially showed off the
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.080]   phone, he didn't say this wasn't Chatted, looked a heck of a lot.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   It looks like it makes the eye chat sound.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   Right.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.200]   And so it was kind of a surprise to people a few weeks before him when they said, "Oh,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   wait, that's SMS.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.520]   Oh, no, we want Chats too, please."
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.960]   So yeah, I think that's right up on the list.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.560]   Although for battery reasons, SMS might be more practical.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.400]   I don't know.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.240]   Scott Borne, you spend a lot of time with iPhones and third-party apps for iPhone.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   What do you think is missing?
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:33.880]   I definitely am up there on the to-do list needs to be added for sure.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.120]   I'm actually one of those kinds of people that knows more about what I don't want added
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.320]   to the phone than what I do.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.680]   I don't want a GPS because it's going to drain the battery.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.920]   It's going to take forever to acquire the satellites.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.600]   I don't want a video camera.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.680]   I don't want a blender.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.200]   I want it to stay relatively close to the form and functionality it has now, but I want
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.320]   to see it beefed up.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.600]   We get a lot of email people wanting this and that.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.240]   A lot of people seem to want things like GPS.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.200]   Then when I break down to them what the cost is going to be in terms of battery life performance
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.280]   and stuff like that, they back off a little bit.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.800]   For me, Chats is probably a no-brainer.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.080]   I like to see the ability to do the to-do list.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.480]   I'd actually like to see a beef up the camera a little bit.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.280]   I'd like to see either exposure control or a mini flash.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.640]   Just an exposure control alone would really make the camera quite a bit more valuable.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.840]   A2 DP for Bluetooth, so you have stereo Bluetooth headphones.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   It would be nice.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.640]   I use with my Blackberry.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.960]   Actually, this is actually very cool.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.360]   A little GPS dongle that goes on my keychain.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   It's that small.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.480]   It acquires very fast, uses the new Surf3 chipset.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.880]   It acquires almost instantly.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.760]   It does not drain the battery any other Bluetooth stuff does.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.800]   What's weird is it works with Google Maps.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.160]   Google Maps will automatically see the Bluetooth GPS signal.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.560]   All of that Google Maps stuff suddenly works as a GPS device.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.280]   It doesn't give you a turn-by-turn out loud, but it will give you a turn-by-turn direction
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.560]   from your current GPS location.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.880]   That wouldn't be a big battery drain to add that to the iPhone.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.240]   In fact, it's not even any hardware change.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.160]   It's just A2 DP can be done in software.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.520]   Bluetooth GPS can be done in software.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.840]   There are two things you could easily do.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.480]   Andy Inaka, what do you think would be nice to add to the iPhone?
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.560]   Two things, a small thing and a big thing.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:33.400]   If Apple put in an outliner, I learned that from the Newton that if you have an outliner,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.960]   that gives the user the ability to create almost any database application they want.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.680]   If they want to have a to-do list, they can use an outliner to do a list.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.520]   If they want to use it as a note-taker, it's a note-taker.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.760]   If they want to be a project manager, they can create an outline that's a project manager.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.280]   It's one of those things that for every 1% worth of effort Apple puts into this application,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.840]   the users will magnify that by a hundredfold.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.560]   The first person that comes out with a decent outliner will get my 10, 20, 30 or 40 bucks
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.320]   over much they're going to ask for it.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.560]   The big thing that I really want is more subtle.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.920]   I really want this iPhone to operate as an extension of my desktop.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.240]   I want this to be the portable version of my life on my computer.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.520]   I want there to be an icon that I can simply drag any content onto and it just winds up
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.640]   on my iPhone.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.800]   I wanted to know who I've been talking, be able to figure out who I've been talking to
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.560]   and who I'm going to want to talk to next.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.560]   I wanted to know the projects where I am on my various projects and give me one, two,
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.440]   or three taps to get at the information that I want.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.880]   I want to be able to even do really, really outside the box things like use the Bluetooth
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:43.480]   transceiver as an encrypted ID chip.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.560]   Wait a minute, I've just noticed that Andy Naco is there with his iPhone.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.760]   I can access his keychain if he wants and basically turn this, turn myself into an extension
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.080]   of his own Macintosh.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.760]   I can make sure that I'm getting all my bookmarks off of the iPhone, make sure that I call and
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.600]   address book are basically acting as conduits to the phone.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.360]   I can even do things like because the new OS can find your Mac from anywhere on the network.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.800]   It could now mount my local hard drive on its own basically just because I'm using my
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.640]   iPhone as a very, very secure, very, very sophisticated ID badge that identifies myself
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   to a network.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.400]   It's a great phone, it's a wonderful phone, it's my favorite phone, but I think that Apple's
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.600]   the company that could really turn this into something much, much bigger than what it actually
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   is.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.640]   It fits in very well with what Apple seems to be headed towards the idea of putting everything
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   everywhere.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.400]   It, Macelope, does that make sense given what Apple has already told us about how the Apple
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.800]   TV, what was it, Apple in your pocket, Apple in your living room, Apple in your TV, Apple
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   everywhere?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.040]   I would certainly hope so, I mean, because that sounds like utopian, the utopian vision
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.920]   of technology that we've been promised for.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.720]   Yeah, well, Apple's, Apple's saying this instead, yeah, I mean, remember that old video
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.240]   that Apple made that knowledge navigator video?
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.520]   I mean, it's really that's what this is in a small form.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.160]   Yeah, I mean, even then just think about the things that you can do with silent clicker
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.560]   with any phone inside your house.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.960]   I see no reason why the iPhone should not be able to ask as act as a really sophisticated
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.400]   iTunes remote for all the content I've got in my house or why I shouldn't be, if my printer
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.440]   runs out of paper upstairs, I shouldn't be able to get a little pop up.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.960]   That simply says, oh, by the way, this is one of the, remember back in your desktop, you
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.880]   clicked that this is one of those things you definitely want to be informed over no matter
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   where you are.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.600]   Well, I'm informing you that your computer is on fire and you might want to go up there
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   with a bucket of standards.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.120]   You know, when I hear this, this utopian vision, I think it fits very well with Apple's vision.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.520]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.280]   You know, my gut reaction to this is Apple just doesn't have the resources or anywhere
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.120]   near the resources to pull this off.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.560]   Well, look, they own the hardware, they own the OS.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.880]   They now have a tendril.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.480]   And now with iTunes, which installs all of its own stuff when you install the app, now
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.720]   they have tendrils into Windows desktops, I'm not saying that they could be, you know,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.080]   one ring to unite them all, but I'm saying that it could be one of the reasons why people
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   on Windows would much rather have an iPhone than any of the device.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.320]   I think Apple wants to do this.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.200]   I think that there is a dearth of a brain power.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.560]   Well, I wonder about it.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.440]   It's just a philosophical thing that they have, I mean, the iPod could do much more than
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.120]   it does and Apple is very clearly decided it's only going to do this much.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.800]   And if they view the iPhone as an iPod kind of environment, say, no, we really want to
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.480]   make a great phone that does a few other things.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   It's that's cool.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   But other than that, forget it.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.280]   You know, if you want a computer, we make computers.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   You can do that.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.120]   If you want an iPod, well, this is sort of an iPod, but yes, you can get an iPod as well.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.040]   So I think, of course, they could do all this stuff.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.480]   It's just a matter of whether they want to.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   Back a look.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.640]   I think one of the last pieces that you need to sort of bring the whole thing together is
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.720]   higher capacity storage on the iPhone.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:37:00.000]   I mean, if the iPhone at 160 gig, you know, it can't be hard drive based because the whole
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.240]   thing is pretty much predicated on flash memory.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.440]   But memory is getting cheaper and cheaper.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.360]   I'm sure you could load more in there.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.000]   You know, you could get your files under the thing as well.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.480]   I mean, I've got a trans flash card, 4 gig trans flash card that's smaller than my pinky
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   nail.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.840]   I mean, I really, I think we're starting to find, we're starting to feel out with a sweet spot
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.560]   for real storages.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.760]   And I think that it does hover for a handheld device somewhere around 16 gigs where, because
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:35.120]   right now with my 8 gig iPhone, I find myself very rarely wishing that I had more storage
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   on the thing.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.520]   And that's, of course, that's just with loading media stuff on there.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.920]   But we're talking about movie files that I use that are 1.2, 1.4 gigabytes apiece.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   You just learn that stuff on.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.720]   Given that iTunes makes it so easy for you to manage the content, I really think that
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.160]   if I had 16 gigs, that would be good enough for me.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.000]   I wouldn't really appreciate having 40 or 50 or 60.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I mean, as it is, I have 160 gigabyte iPod.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.120]   And it's one of the best things I've ever bought only because it means that I can, it's
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.520]   always docked to my desktop.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.280]   I always have to do a backup of all the things that change from day to day.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.840]   And because I always dock it at night, and I always take and carry around with me when
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.200]   I leave the house, it means that it's always a 24 hour backup.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.760]   And if something awful happens back in the hotel room or back at the house, like a fire
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.880]   or a theft, at least I have all these documents carried around with me.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.160]   You notice that none of that extra storage is being used for the things that an iPod is
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.440]   supposed to be used for, which is to play a media.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.080]   I just think that if I had more than 16 gigs on an iPhone, I would be exploiting it in
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.080]   that sort of way.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.520]   It wouldn't be making it a better, stronger, more powerful iPhone.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   It would be--
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.520]   Exactly.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.520]   But that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.160]   I'm talking about taking your home directory with you everywhere you go.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   What about this idea that the iPhone--
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.600]   I can have access to my home directory anyway.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   What about--
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   What about--
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.400]   What about Chris Breen's point though that-- I think this really is where the disconnect
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.560]   happens between what some people want for the iPhone and what others want for the iPhone.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.840]   What about Chris Breen's assertion that Apple's just keeping it simple.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.960]   They want to make a simple consumer device.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.440]   They don't ever want to make something more powerful.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.880]   Well, that's not been historically Apple's.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   They've always been--
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.880]   Also, they're dipped in the iPod.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   But it's never really been--
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.080]   Well, again, compared the original iPod to what other MP3 players were like back then.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.720]   It was light years ahead.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.760]   It wasn't more complicated, but it was able to do more stuff.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.240]   I do think that Chris has a big point, and that's really something that's universal for
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.040]   the development of all technology.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.080]   So many times it's the basic philosophy that one word statement-- excuse me, that one sentence
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.160]   statement that may have been put onto a whiteboard, but maybe just something that all the designers
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.000]   understood, that one thing that commands what happens to that device.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.440]   And this is something I've been saying for the past few months now that Apple needs--
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.920]   I really wish I understood whether Apple thinks it's selling a cell phone or whether it's
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.240]   selling a computing platform.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.760]   Because if they've decided that what they're selling is a cell phone, that explains so
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.440]   much of what they're doing and what they will do in the future.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.600]   Most of the disappointment that I know other people have about the iPhone is that we expect
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.920]   it to be a computing platform, and that may be completely irresponsible because Apple just
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.400]   is not interested in making it.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   That's the right thing.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   Right.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.320]   Well, we aren't very rare for our data.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.600]   I mean, we're all geeks.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.920]   We all love the Mac, and we all want to do everything we possibly can with the equipment
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.680]   that we own.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.360]   But what percentage of that market are we?
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.920]   Are we 7%?
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.680]   And does Apple look at us and say, "Yeah, we know you'd like that."
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   Right.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   Too bad.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.200]   Because we're marketing to the other 93%, not you guys.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.240]   So I mean, we have a big voice and we speak loudly, but they may very well be able to
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.640]   ignore that because they say, "You're not our core customer for this device."
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.440]   You're absolutely right.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.800]   There's a certain amount of arrogance that is so easy to ignore when we're--
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.680]   We're a bunch of geeks of the same sort of mindset or talking to each other.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.400]   We're wealthy like we're all Cassandra.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   The planet is in pain.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.920]   Why am the only one who can hear her cries?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:13.360]   But on the other hand, when I go shopping for a car, I don't want a car that's marketed
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.760]   to people like me, idiots who don't know what good car design is, what things to look for.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.200]   I'm glad that there are people out there who are saying, "Well, look, this is a nice,
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.720]   cool little car, but for $500 less, you can get this car that has an engine that's much
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.840]   easier to maintain that has a lot more oomph to it, that's going to deal with bad weather
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   better."
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.920]   Again, which is not to say that all should bow down before us.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.840]   I mean, they should, but I'm not going to come out and say that tends to ding the advertising
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.320]   on the show, I'm sure.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.640]   But I really do think that both perspectives are equally valid.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.080]   Well, clearly they need to make an iPhone elite.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.720]   So you sell it for a thousand.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   It's not a long--
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   I had to tell it's--
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   I had to take them from the past to the extent or the thrills they won't sell it to you.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   They did.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.120]   It was called the Newton, and it didn't sell very well.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Oh, that.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.200]   I think they are probably-- Now, of course, the Newton was pre-steep jobs, but I wonder
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:08.920]   if they're a little leery of making something as multipurpose as the Newton.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.440]   Maybe-- been there, done that.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.720]   Let's not go that way again.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:17.320]   Yeah, I think they could go that way if they did it in sort of this way that like, no,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.760]   this is an extension of the iPhone.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.440]   So they both jump up and jump down.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.200]   So they make a nano kind of iPhone, but very simple, smaller form factor.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.720]   I'm sure they're considering that, right?
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.880]   And then they make something that's much more of an information kind of device.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.200]   And so we are willing to pay the thousand bucks or our employer or you, Leo.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   I will.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   I will.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   That's coming, Leo.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.840]   You're invested in all those tech stocks.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   We're not.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.720]   No, I sold them all.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.400]   I can now safely say that Scott Born's the only guy who has any tech stocks.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   Where's our disclaimer?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   That's right.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.240]   I haven't made the disclaimer in a while, but you know, we made it on Twitch, just even
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240]   though you weren't there.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.440]   I just thought, well, I'm going to say this anyway.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.320]   I think it makes sense really.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.360]   And this is kind of what I've been saying all along to.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.920]   If the iPhone isn't your cup of tea, if you want more of a portable computer or more
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.720]   of something else and maybe to wait because I think there will be a broader line of iPhones
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.720]   in time, right?
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.360]   You've got to be.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.400]   What would you strip out to make a smaller iPhone?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.560]   I think I would say make it an iPod plus phone.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   Take out all of the.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.040]   No web browser, no mail.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.600]   Take out Wi-Fi, which eats battery life.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   Right.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.800]   I think that would be a good product.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.640]   People have tried to make phones with music players.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.040]   None of them have done very well.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.720]   That's what this could have been.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   Maybe it would have been smarter.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.080]   Apple could have avoided this whole discussion had they started with that.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.280]   I just want one out of size.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.440]   I just want one the size of a molar so I can get a gold molar and it's got an iPhone in
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   it.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.920]   And I just double click my job and answer the call.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.560]   You already have that diamond grill that you wear it all those society.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.680]   Yeah, that's another got born.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   It's got their name.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   More in it.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   Or I just didn't say that.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.600]   See, I don't know.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.360]   When you have like, especially when you have like the older, the second generation iPod
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.280]   nano, this is going to sound like I'm just, you know, making a joke, but you have to,
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.920]   you have to provide a solution that's better than a consumer taking their existing phone
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.040]   and then just double sided taping a nano to the back of it.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   Do you?
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.000]   And I don't, I can't really see a nano with a keypad on it.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.540]   That would be a better solution than simply saying, well, you know, the one you guys
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.540]   got for free with your contract.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.440]   Here's another $130 by an anode.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   Stick it to the back.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   There you go.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.440]   You got the best.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.320]   You got a, you've got a phone that will, will see all the needs that you have.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.080]   And you also have one of the best media players you can possibly have done and done.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.720]   Go to Home Depot cost you a three bucks for whole roll of the double side of tape and
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.880]   you can go to go to the store and sell strips of this stuff for eight dollars per as an
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.360]   aftermarket item.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.200]   Greenpeace is saying that the iPhone is hazardous to your health.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.120]   Apple saying, no, it's not.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.700]   Once again, Greenpeace, Greenpeace up in Apple's grill.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.700]   The planet is in pain people.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.700]   He's, he's crying.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.700]   He's not happy.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.620]   He's not your flavoring man.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.140]   I think, I think it's pretty much safe to say that all consumer electronics is bad for
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.980]   mother earth.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.740]   And you probably shouldn't buy more than you have to.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.740]   Just the batteries alone.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:23.020]   Why don't they go to China and just like go to China and deal with the hotel toys that
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.020]   are made over there.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.180]   That'll keep them busy for a long time.
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.760]   At least these can lick our iPhone.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.560]   You have to worry about lead paint.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.760]   I try not to lick my eye.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.760]   Oh, but it's liquor.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.360]   How did you know I did that, Leo?
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.000]   Who've been talking to?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.800]   Scott Warren has so many iPhones.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.440]   He uses one as a sucker.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.360]   It's like bandwidth.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.760]   Yes.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.920]   So what do we think about this?
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   Anything?
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   Do we care?
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.800]   I mean, you know, I understand what Greenpeace is saying and I'm sure it's true.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   Are they picking on the iPhone?
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.920]   Because it's so they're picking on Apple.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.260]   I mean, they've been picking on Apple for a few years now.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.260]   You know, they've been standing outside the Moscone Center every year when we go into
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.500]   the camp with their things and it just, you know, it never changes.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.340]   It doesn't matter what they do.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.500]   Just a way of getting more attention, I guess.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:11.180]   Well, you know, I mean, it's not necessarily a bad cause, but, but, you know, to a certain
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.180]   degree.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.380]   I just think they're picking on Apple because Apple's got a big name and well, and Apple
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:19.340]   also affects a green ish you.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.340]   And Al Gore is on the board.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.840]   I mean, you know, it's funny.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.800]   You go to that bigger targets that you pick.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.920]   You go to the Apple front page and of course, leopard has now taken over from the Al Gore
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   congratulations.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.040]   Nevertheless, on the hot news headlines, there's like four stories about Al Gore.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.760]   Al Gore wins a Nobel Prize Al Gore Peace Prize winner.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.280]   Al Gore, I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.440]   So they obviously they're, they're, they want to be seen as green.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.280]   And I know that Steve personally, you know, he's a, he's a vegan.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.780]   He's very serious about being green.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.700]   So I can see why green, he probably hurts him deeply that green pieces so angry.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.460]   I think it hurts him deeply.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.540]   Does anything, does anything, anything hurts deep?
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   Besides a stake through the heart or a silver bullet, does anything else?
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.460]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:14.220]   It's, it's, it's, it's just last week, PETA, you know, made a issued a press release asking,
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:19.400]   asking the judge and the Britney Spears custody battle to a work custody of the dogs to Kevin
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   Federline.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.880]   And you know, you're at, at some point in the history of some of these organizations,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.200]   you think, wow, I am so totally convinced that they felt so deeply about this issue.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   It's time to stop.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.280]   It's a good way to get people like us to talk about events like, all right, which is too
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.640]   bad because oftentimes they are making serious points, but you know, they, you reach a saturation
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.240]   point where you say, Oh, who said that?
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   Greenpeace?
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.480]   That's nice.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   Too bad.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   We weren't at, that's nice.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.820]   And we'll be ready in 45 minutes.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.820]   Wash your hands.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.820]   Too bad.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:50.560]   We weren't at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium this morning because that's where Bill Gates
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:58.460]   was and Jeff Rakes of Microsoft to announce their move into anybody, anybody?
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.460]   Something.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.460]   A three bedroom sublet and so-ho.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:06.100]   Don't always suspect about those two telephony telephony telephony.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.100]   I'll do it.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.100]   Phone.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.540]   They, they want to do.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.980]   They're going to do a phone.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:16.080]   Now a lot of this is, is middleware for telephony, things like the office communications server
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.440]   and so forth.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.860]   But it sounds like they also might want to do a phone.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   Is this Windows weekly?
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   No, I just thought we'd mention that there's some competition coming.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.660]   Well, they already have a really good phone operating system.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:37.600]   Windows Mobile Smartphone Edition was my, oh, my phone of choice.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.760]   I really think it's a really good, effective use of a five-button interface.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.320]   And I will, I will defend that.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.320]   I mean, you can't always-
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.560]   I've buttoned five click.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.560]   Right.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.840]   I mean, no, up, up, down, left, right.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   Okay.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.560]   It was a very, very easy, very, very simple, very, very effective.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.480]   And also it had something that I do wish that the iPhone has, has, which is a universal
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   back button.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.840]   No matter where you are, you click one button and you always go back up one level from where
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.600]   you were before.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:07.840]   And again, it's, it's, again, the difference between someone who wants to spend $599 for
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.600]   the most advanced user interface on the planet versus someone who's willing to spend maybe
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.320]   $40 or $50 more than, than for a normal phone just to get a decent web browser and to be
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.880]   able to load more advanced applications.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:26.640]   Again, I mean, Blog Lines on Windows Mobile Smartphone is only, is surprisingly close to
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.040]   the experience of using Blog Lines Mobile on an iPhone.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.200]   I say though, I love Google Reader or Blog Lines Mobile on the iPhone.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.440]   That's a great way to read news.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   Right.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.440]   They're both great.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.840]   But in terms of my usual, see, my usual lunchtime posture is, you know, my phone in one hand,
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.720]   a sandwich in the other hand, I've got 30 minutes to, you know, exactly.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.360]   You know, I can't, and believe it or not, I feel, I feel like I have to still read news
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.520]   while I'm eating lunch.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.520]   It's that sad.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.960]   But, which, there was between doing something with a flick of a thumb and doing something
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.520]   with a click of a thumb.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.040]   And they're both extremely effective.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.400]   So, I mean, I'm actually interested to see what they do with this.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.720]   If they make the mistake of trying to make an iPhone, they're going to fail miserably
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.320]   as we saw with the Zoom.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.760]   But if they simply take the people who had all those good ideas for the Windows Mobile
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.840]   Smartphone and try to go in a different direction, create something that will, again, add maybe
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.180]   $30 to the cost of a phone as opposed to quadrupling the cost of the phone, that could
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.180]   be an interesting prospect.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:23.040]   Although, did you see, I saw, you know, the legions of golems who do nothing but look
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.800]   at patent filings, saw that Microsoft had patented the iPhone three days after it came
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   out.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Just a case.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Just a case.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   Just in case.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.520]   Just in case they need to have one little extra quiver in there.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.720]   They patented the user interface.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.040]   They patent the screen, look, layout.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   Here's kind of a surprise.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.400]   We had thought that maybe the iPhone wouldn't make it to France because of France's consumer
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:49.800]   laws requiring providers to unlock the phone and offer a, and every, every cell phone company
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.120]   has to offer unlocked versions of its phones.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:59.200]   But early today, Apple announced that Orange will be carrying the iPhone in France, November
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.040]   29th, 399 euros, ouch.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.960]   That includes VAT with any Orange dedicated rate plan subscription.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.720]   So I don't know how they're going to respond to the French unlock rules.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.960]   More than likely they cut a deal to with the French government.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.120]   Yeah, the French government's rules are always kind of.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.040]   Oh, you don't have to if you give us maybe a little depends on our cut.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.200]   What do we get from these?
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.760]   We all sound like Pappy de P. I really thought that Apple wouldn't go into France simply
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.680]   because of this rule will be it'll be very interesting to see.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.640]   Speaking of unlocks, of course, the iPhone dev team is now saying, yes, we can unlock
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   one one one.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.280]   iPhone SIM free is offering a one one one unlock.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.120]   Boy, that surprised me.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.880]   I did not expect this to happen so quickly.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   Chris Breen.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.080]   Well, it's taken a little longer than I thought it would two weeks.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.280]   Yeah, it took two weeks.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.560]   But you know, if you looked in the past, once they got rolling on these things, man, that
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.920]   stuff happened really really.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.560]   This one's more of a hack, I understand.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.760]   I mean, this one kind of is a, doesn't it?
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.000]   Is it like a buffer overflow?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.320]   There's some sort of exploit involved.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.320]   There's a TIFF overflow.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.160]   Yeah, they have to get in that way.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.600]   In the past, what they would do is they would essentially mimic the communication protocol
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.760]   between iTunes and the phone.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.000]   And that's the way they would get in.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.640]   So they would get into that circuit and say, oh, look, no, no, no, we're part of iTunes
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.840]   too.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.800]   And after you finish doing that, we just have one more little thing we'd like you to do
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   right here.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   And that is here.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.120]   Now we're in.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:40.480]   So yeah, at this point, they're taking advantage of another security hole in the phone, which
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.280]   means, of course, Apple is easily working on this thing and we'll have some way to shut
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   this off as well.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.480]   It'd be very easy to fix this one.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.840]   And again, you're looking at unlocking the phones.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.440]   And I think it will give a lot of people pause simply after what happened last time.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.200]   I'm not going to ever do it.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.640]   No, we were willing to do it once to try and find out what would happen.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.080]   And I'm certainly willing to try things like independence for getting things on there.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:12.040]   But no, not the idea of unlocking a phone again.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.480]   And this, go ahead.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.440]   Just going to say, unlocking the phone is going to be a little bit less imperative over
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.120]   the next coming months as people start to opt out of their existing contracts when they
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:27.240]   suddenly have the ability to switch from Verizon to AT&T without paying any extra money.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.640]   Yeah, good point.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.440]   And as more international carriers sign up, like orange, because I think really a lot
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.560]   of the impetus, I'll tell you where a lot of the impetus, I imagine now, is from Canada,
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.200]   where there's no end in sight.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:43.800]   I mean, nobody offers a flat rate data plan that would be suitable for the iPhone.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.400]   It's going to be very expensive to use an iPhone up there.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.560]   And Apple hates the Canadians anyway.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.320]   We know that for sure.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.360]   Not just that, but Canadian adjacent again.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:59.280]   It seems like, you know, not just hates plaid and I don't think you'll ever allow this.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   Yes.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.200]   Frightened by the Statue of Paul Bunyan and Bitterainerd.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   I think that's what it was.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   That's our vacation.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.720]   It was eight years old.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.280]   And well, you're not allowed to be a vegan in Canada anyway.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   That's a good point.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   That's a good point.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.280]   He's not really a vegan, by the way.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   He's not?
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.280]   He's a vegetarian.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.920]   And actually, I think he even eats fish.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   His wife hates fish.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   His wife's a vegan.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.920]   He hates fish.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   They eat sushi though.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.920]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   You can't be a vegan if you eat sushi.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.720]   And I think he eats the fish sushi.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.640]   I think his wife is a strict vegan, but I may be wrong.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.960]   I'm on a seafood diet.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.560]   I eat everything I see.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.480]   We can tell Scott born.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.560]   Yeah, Scott and I never turn away nothing.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.840]   Hey, good news.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.700]   We were talking quite a bit about Amazon, how much we liked their new store and their
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.640]   prices as low as 89 cents a song.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:51.920]   Apple today announced they're dropping the DRM free price to 99 cents.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.920]   That's big.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   That's huge.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.360]   Those 256 kilobits DRM free songs used to be buck 29.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   99 cents.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.080]   Did they bring independence on to?
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   That's a good question.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   I don't.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   I.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.760]   Because I think that was the other part of it is that I was a lot of us.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.160]   I think we're talking about how wonderful Amazon was because of the prices and the fact
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.560]   that the independence were all around.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.040]   They're deep and free.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.640]   And I got mail saying, no, no, no, iTunes is so much better and universal.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.840]   This is universal plot to undo iTunes.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.200]   I thought, no, this is going to make a competitive environment and let's see what Apple does.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.560]   You know, this is what gets me.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:32.520]   Sometimes the Apple fanboys don't understand that the whole competition is good for everybody.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.520]   Right.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.560]   Well, that's the thing I said about it.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.040]   Number one, that was the first thing I wanted to have happen was I didn't care whether or
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.800]   not it was the perfect result.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.840]   But I knew that it would it would finally give iTunes some competition, which is good
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.280]   for those of us that like iTunes.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   Right.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.280]   iTunes will be better because of it.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   It's not.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.320]   But now we got 99 cent DRM free music instead of a buck, whatever it was.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.400]   I don't see an announcement.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.080]   The statement that went out from Tom Newmeyer is iTunes plus has been incredibly popular
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.080]   with our customers.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.000]   And now we're making it available at an even more affordable price.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.040]   We're adding over 2 million tracks from key independent labels.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.240]   Yes, there it is.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:12.480]   In addition to EMI's digital catalog and look forward to even more labels and artists making
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.000]   their music available on iTunes plus now, if they add flexible pricing, I think they
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.480]   get universal back in the fold.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.080]   I really think go ahead, Andy.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.040]   I'm just going to say, I think that as much as the Amazon thread, this is as much a response
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.440]   to the new version of the zoom marketplace.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:33.840]   And they basically I don't know who they fired, killed, sacrificed to the God, but all or
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.040]   hired at Microsoft on the zoom team.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.760]   But the blind can see the lame and waltzing.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:44.160]   They just basically it's like they said, okay, this column that that that an Arco wrote last
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.280]   year, we're going to check off every single thing he hated about this.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   I'm going to fix it.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.400]   They're doing copy protection free MP threes.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.000]   What else are they doing that you like?
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.240]   They've changed the change the user interface.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.400]   So it's much quicker, much more slick.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:04.440]   They've added they've made the Wi-Fi chip inside that device actually do something now.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:09.800]   So not only can you sync wirelessly, but you can also swap content between two users
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.120]   while wirelessly.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.080]   And now it's a useful feature in the first version.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:18.360]   All you could do was sort of advertise a commercial song to other people with this one.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.760]   If it's if it's if it's a podcast, they can have it because the system understands it
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.840]   podcast.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.960]   If it's a commercial song, you still get I think you still get three plays, but the three
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.400]   day time limit is now gone.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:34.760]   And also they've also now finally understood there are these things called podcasts.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:39.880]   And now the zoom software now supports it directly instead of forcing you to add on
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:43.000]   an extra podcast podcast to make it work.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.600]   So can I flash my zoom to do this or do I have to?
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   Yeah, they I don't think they've offered the firmware yet, but they say they will.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   Even even even a brown zoom supposedly will work with this.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.200]   Even a brown zoom.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.800]   And I have to quit making zoom jokes because my good friend Rob Greenlee just took the
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.240]   job at Microsoft to bringing all the podcasts on board to the zoom.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   So he's a good guy.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.120]   Let's so is he the one responsible for this move?
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   Because we're thrilled.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.000]   I don't know if he's responsible, but he's responsible for implementation.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   So awesome.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.480]   He'll he'll do a good job of that.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.560]   He's been around forever and he knows about podcasts.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   Oh, he does.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.000]   In fact, you know, he was doing Web Talk radio, you know, in Seattle.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.080]   We did that show together up there a couple of times and great.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:27.160]   He knows the whole world of podcasting really well and he'll he'll be a great representative
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.760]   to the zoom community.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.440]   And he's invited all of our shows on except for some reason he doesn't want the Apple
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.880]   phone show.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.440]   You start doing an Apple zoom show.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.520]   He's going to love you.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.360]   Maybe this is turned into the Apple zoom show.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.360]   I thought this was app.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.800]   I thought this is Mac break here.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   I ended up on the Windows weekly show.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.440]   Yeah, if we're going to stop making fun of the zoom, we can still make fun of the zoom
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.680]   tattoo guy, can't we?
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.680]   Yeah, I got an email.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.800]   Why should we be the only one to leave more anything?
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.320]   The color brown Andy.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.120]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.040]   He is he is he is starting to turn.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.400]   He's getting an Apple tattoo now, supposedly.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.400]   Oh, that's just confused.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.920]   It's going to be on his butt, but that's okay.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.000]   It's still on there for life.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.760]   I'm sitting on an apple.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.800]   It's I was about to say something very, very rude, but not to say so next week, we'll talk
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.400]   more about leopard and and I would.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.920]   And I would really like to, especially with you, Chris Breen, because this is your Bailey
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.680]   Wicke talk about what to do to get ready.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.080]   Okay, leopard.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:30.720]   But now, meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for our Mac picks of the week.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.160]   And I will give Mackalope some time to think of something.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   So let's go right to.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.160]   I've got something.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   You do.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   I do.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   Mackalope, you demand.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   Go ahead.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   You start.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   Okay.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   Exactly.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.440]   Something that's been talked about before, but I don't think it's been done as a pick.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.920]   And that is ITV.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   Not Apple TV.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   What is it?
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   No, not Apple TV.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   ITV.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   ITV is from Elgato.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   And it's a hardware TV.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   EY TV.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   All one word.
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:02.040]   And it is a hardware software combination and they sell these little units that are USB
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.760]   2.0 that you plug into your Mac and you plug the other end into your cable and you can
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.120]   record TV shows onto your Mac and edit them as you see fit.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:19.040]   And the thing that makes me bring this up is that they just released a new version.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.280]   I think it was last week.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.480]   And one of the neat features that they added to the software is the ability to stream your
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.320]   shows to your iPhone via Wi-Fi.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   Wow.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.080]   So that's been a pretty neat feature that I've been enjoying over the last few days.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   You've been using it.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.080]   How well does it work?
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.080]   It works pretty well.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:47.160]   My main problem is that I'm using it on an old Mac and I need to get a new one.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   GMac, yeah.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.960]   I imagine on Anne it would work fantastic.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.560]   Yeah, that would probably really.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.920]   Now you're not saving the show.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920]   It's streaming.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920]   You're watching it.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.560]   No, you're saving the show to your iPhone but you saved the show onto your hard drive.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   Okay.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.360]   And you could move it to your iPhone later if you wanted to watch it again.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   Yes, exactly.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.800]   You could edit it and then export it to iTunes and it loads right up onto your iPhone.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.400]   Now I know they have HD solutions.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.920]   Does the HD solution do this or is this just the…?
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   Yeah, no, it's the whole thing.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.520]   As a matter of fact I think it even has to convert it to…?
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520]   16.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520]   Not.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.520]   HD at 264.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   Oh, on the phone.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.080]   Because that's what the iPhone does.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080]   Wow.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.600]   So it's nice.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   Go ahead, Annie.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.720]   I was going to say, yeah, no, I've had ITV for like three or four years now.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:39.400]   It was actually my first HD experience of any kind and really is wonderful because it's
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:44.200]   just as though my God, the Letterman is now podcasting his entire show because every
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.600]   morning by the time you get your iPhone out of your dock or get your iPod out of your
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.400]   dock, last night's Letterman show is there converted and installed on your iPod ready
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   to go.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.960]   I'm jealous or iPhone now.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.640]   I'm jealous because you live in an urban area where you can get HD TV on the over the
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   air.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.320]   Yeah, I get like some of them but not all of them.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.840]   I think there's going to be an open urban revolt when everybody who does not have…
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.040]   Everyone has cable somewhere but it's not like they have cable and all four TVs in
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   their house.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.520]   I mean, I only recently got cable in my office and that's only because my broadband started
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.840]   coming in through the wall closest to my office anyway so I figured what the hell.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.920]   I'd love to have this but I don't have cable.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.960]   Oh, but it works with cable.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.960]   Yeah, it's just a…
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.880]   It works with analog broadcasts.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   It works with analog.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880]   I don't have any of that stuff.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   You put the total.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.880]   Don't have cable.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   Don't have cable.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   Don't have cable.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   I download everything.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.400]   I just download everything.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.400]   Sometimes legally.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.400]   Sometimes I buy it on iTunes.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.640]   If it's available on iTunes, I buy it.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   Cool.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:49.840]   ITV, it's Elgato, E-L-G-A-T-O dot com and the latest software which I think you can download.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.680]   Yeah, you can download the software.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.840]   Well, if you already have one, I mean, it only works with their unit as far as I understand.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:02.400]   So you have to buy the hardware but the software update is free.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.600]   Very, very cool.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.400]   I just wish they had one extra feature on there.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.360]   On a TVO, a traditional TVO, of course, it only has an X gigabyte hard drive.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.560]   So when you start running out of space, it deletes old stuff to make room for the new
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.560]   stuff.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.000]   I really wish ITV had a feature saying, "I only want to record a maximum of 30 gigabytes
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   worth of stuff."
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Right.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Because if you don't…
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.840]   If you forget about that, I had 130 gigabytes of free space on this new iMac go down to
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.400]   your… you have no free space left.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   Please close down on one of the next applications.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.720]   It'd be nice if you simply said, "Look, that episode of the Craig Kilborn show from
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.920]   three weeks ago, I think you can lose this now."
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   Thank you.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   I get there about every two weeks.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.760]   A lot of copy of "Red Rugrats" on there.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.080]   All right.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.920]   Let's get Scott Born's pick of the weeks.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   Got it?
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.280]   I recommend a website where you can pick up some really cool speakers, audioengineusa.com.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.600]   I got a pair of their A5 bookshelf speakers a couple weeks ago and I paid for these.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.000]   So less than anyone thinks that this is some kind of…
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.520]   Anyway, I paid for these bottom.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.560]   They're $349 and it's a remarkable price and here's why.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.640]   When I listen to these little speakers, I like to audition music that's acoustic in
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.640]   speakers.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   That's how you really tell if it's good.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.320]   I was blown away by them.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.800]   But they're not just speakers.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.880]   They're an iPod charger and iPod dock.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.240]   You can just drop your iPod into these speakers and play it.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.320]   They have their own amplifier.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.360]   They're amazing to say.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.240]   Did you get the five?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.560]   I got the five.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.480]   It also has a whole bunch of other stuff though.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.560]   It'll basically play any audio source.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.400]   Even by the way, it works with Zunes.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.560]   Anything that has an 8-inch mini jack or RCA output can come into it.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.480]   It has two audio inputs.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.040]   It's wireless ready.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.280]   Works with the airport express right out of the box.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.240]   The quality of these speakers just flat out blew me away.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:01.040]   I expected there to be a one in front of that $349 when I listened to them.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.600]   The company is a good company.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.480]   It's only half an Alex.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.800]   If you want some speakers that you can use double duty both with your stereo system at
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.920]   home and to just be your iPod charger player or whatever, I take a look at these.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.960]   By the way, they do have what they call an audition period of 30 days.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.720]   You can try them out like I'm sending them back.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   No subwoofer on these.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.200]   They're just left right.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.000]   But the bass is pretty good?
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.320]   Oh, that's the thing that's shocking.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.880]   It sounds really nice.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.640]   It doesn't sound like boom box bass, which I don't want.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.320]   It's an appropriate amount of bass.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.440]   It's a good amount of bass.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.440]   It's in my opinion, just enough bass.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.040]   The size of the speakers, you look at them and you think, "Man, that's not going to work."
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.080]   When you listen to them, it's really good.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:57.240]   Unlike a certain company whose initials are Bose, where you have no highs, you have no
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.280]   lows, it must be Bose.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.480]   There's actually a wide dynamic range in these speakers.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.480]   Cool.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   Very cool.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.160]   That is from audioengineusa.com.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.520]   It looks pretty slick.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.280]   Chris Breen, what's your pick?
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.760]   Well, before I start, I just wanted to say that after listening to the Maccolo, but I
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.320]   recognize his voice.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.880]   You know it is?
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.080]   It's my cousin Bob.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   Bob!
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   Bob!
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   You missed him.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.080]   My cousin Bob.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   Well, he's from the hair challenge side now.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.080]   Bob, or Willard?
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   He said.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.400]   No, but yeah.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.120]   He's hair challenged and so I understand the concept of knowledge.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.120]   That's...
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.960]   Because he's just jealous of your Buffant.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.720]   How could you not be?
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.720]   Look at the man.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720]   It's daunting.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720]   It is daunting.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.920]   No, actually, I love that.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.520]   You don't have to reveal your identity, although I do want to point out we do change
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.440]   his voice so people won't recognize his voice.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.600]   But just give us an idea of what kind of hair pattern you might have.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.520]   Well, it's not like Chris's.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.560]   But I do have a full head of hair.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   Full head of hair.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560]   I'm just making a full...
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.000]   Okay, let's qualify this.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.920]   Your own natural, real growing hair.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   You can even swim with it.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   Yeah, my own natural real good.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   I'll reply.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   I'll reply.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   I'll reply.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   Yes, mine I paid for it.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   Good.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Okay.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   Chris, breathe.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920]   Oh, I had a pick.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   Yes.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   No, that could be your pick.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   Oh, my maccolo.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   Maccolo hair.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   Your hair.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920]   I pick Chris's hair.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920]   The hair cut from men.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   The hair cut from men.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   There's...
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   There you go.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   You're stylist.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.480]   I'm not only the president, I'm a customer.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:37.560]   No, my pick is Wiretap Studio from Ambrosia Software.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.360]   It's just been released $69.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:46.720]   And you can kind of think of it as the aperture for audio, which means you can record anything.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:53.320]   When you go into this program, you select any sort of encoding setting you like, MP3AAC.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.720]   But it always keeps a master recording in the background.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.900]   You can go into the editor then.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.900]   You can do anything you like.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900]   You can trim it.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   You can fade it.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.760]   You can apply audio effects.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.480]   And at any time you want to, you can back up steps or you can go right back to a completely
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.360]   unperturbed version of this thing.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.800]   You can also do something called live preview.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:21.080]   So I can record my podcast, for example, and let's say I recorded it 128 MP3.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   And I just...
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.880]   Now, you know, I really need to get some more...
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.800]   I need to make this thing smaller somehow.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.360]   So I can go right into it, choose that setting and listen to what it sounds like.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.000]   I can do this for any setting I like.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.520]   And that way I can say, "Yeah, okay, great.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.120]   This tells me my podcast is now going to be 9MB.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   And this is the kind of quality I get.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120]   Now I don't like that.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.680]   The quality is bad.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680]   Let's pump it up one.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   It's only a couple of megabytes more.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.680]   And this sounds a whole lot better.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.000]   Once you've done that, you export it and you're good to go.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.520]   I think Andrew Welch has the prize for having the most picks on Mac break weekly ever.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.000]   But he does great stuff.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   He really does.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   He does great stuff.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   And this is something...
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.480]   I've been on the beta list for this forever.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.520]   So it's been in development a really long time.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.960]   Now, is it still a wiretap?
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.000]   I mean, there was wiretap, wiretap, Pro, wiretap studio.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   There's still...
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.600]   It's now just wiretap studio, is that?
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.360]   It's just wiretap studio now, right?
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   Okay.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.960]   And how much is it?
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   $69.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.520]   That's a very good deal.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.120]   Now, how would this compare with ROGAMIBA's Audio High-Jack Pro?
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.080]   Is this a similar...
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.280]   Well, this is what people are comparing it to.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:34.600]   The fact that you can bounce around with ROGAMIBA stuff, you choose a setting that you want.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.320]   And then you're committed to it.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.320]   Yes.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.000]   So the thing you want to do is record an AIFF and then make your choice after that.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.720]   But if you came in recording MP3, you can't change it.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   That's what you've got.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.400]   So if you don't like what you've done, you have to redo it.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.960]   The interface on a wiretap studio is really...
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.120]   My big problem with ROGAMIBA is it's hard to figure out how to patch it.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.640]   I like Audio High-Jack a lot.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.960]   I think it's got a lot of power in there and a lot of capabilities.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   And in some ways, it has a lot more features than wiretap studio.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.400]   However, it is a complicated program.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.400]   It's hard to use.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.880]   I have to read the help file every single time I want to record Skype.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880]   Every single time.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.240]   Now, Chris, are you saying that there's no wiretap, nothing anymore?
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.400]   The $19 version doesn't exist?
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.080]   I talked to Andrew the other day.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.280]   He said that this definitely supplants wiretap pro, but I'm not sure about wiretap, nothing.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.800]   I've looked on the website and I haven't seen wiretap.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.800]   I haven't seen it.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.800]   Is that okay?
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.520]   There's a big difference between a $20 app and a $70 app.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.520]   A $20 app.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.320]   I have to really need an order buy it.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   No, you're right.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.400]   But if you do a lot of recording on your Mac, this seems like this would be a good product
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.400]   to have.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.320]   Now, it says $30 upgrade, right?
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.000]   So yeah, and actually if you have there's a competitive upgrade.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   Yes.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.480]   If you have audio hijack, you get a credit.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.760]   Now it's only $30.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   Now I'm going to buy it.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.800]   Because I would like to have both and just to use whichever is appropriate for the time
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800]   or fission to it.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.720]   It's an across grade for fission as well.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   Cool.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.800]   That is ambrosia SW.com and actually a great place to go just to look at all the cool stuff
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.800]   Andrew's got out there.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.920]   Does iToner work again with him?
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.680]   Probably doesn't, doesn't.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.920]   It is really close to working again.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:20.920]   Oh, really?
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.120]   They said they were committed to getting it working right for them.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:31.080]   Andrew and I talked about that and you'll see another version of it any second.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.280]   Again though, I'd be so nervous.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   I guess something like that.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.120]   I'm less nervous about doing something like that than I would be.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.520]   Yeah, because they're not really doing.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.680]   I mean, they're using the user area of the iPhone rather than digging into the system
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.680]   area of it.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.880]   I feel that anything they do is not going to damage the iPhone right away.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   All right.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   Good pick.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.880]   Let's get to the Mac-a-lope.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.880]   Oh, no, we did the Mac-a-lope.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.960]   Let's get Andy and knock Cole and see what his pick of the week is.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.440]   My pick of the week is from MacRabbit.com CSS edit.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.440]   No, I've kept a really good secret of the fact that I'm redesigning my website and moving
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   to WordPress.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440]   You are?
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.440]   Shy.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   I am.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.200]   I wanted to make it a Mac Break Weekly exclusive today because I know what happens when you
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.720]   announce things too soon.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.720]   It just...
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.640]   This week and every week.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.640]   So finally, I got to the point where I've got things set up and I've got a template
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.640]   set up.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.920]   Now I want to start editing the Cascading style sheets to make it look the way I wanted
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.920]   to.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:32.440]   I'm no spring chicken when it comes to CSS because I hand-coded my first blog with CSS.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:38.280]   Again, I've always found that CSS is the easiest way to customize a web page.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.760]   I think it's easier than I web.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.640]   I think it's easier than Dreamweaver or everything like that.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.920]   You just simply say, "I want the line..."
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:50.280]   How do I sign the line spacing of this paragraph to one and a half lines?
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.960]   You insert a line into the style sheet that says line spacing one and a half lines.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.760]   Oh, that was easy.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.240]   And so in 20 minutes without any guesswork whatsoever, you've got the style sheets and
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.480]   you've got all your text and stuff looking the way you want to.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.360]   But I was having a problem because I was trying to...
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.840]   I had an immediate problem with this new blog and then I was using a theme that someone
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.000]   else had created and I didn't like the font they were using for blog posts.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   And so I thought, "Okay, let's go into the style sheets and just change that font to
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.440]   something else."
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.920]   And I changed one style sheet, no change.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.520]   Change another style sheet, sort of a change about the one I wanted and I wound up giving
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.840]   up after 45 minutes because I just couldn't figure out how this thing was done.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.760]   And so I recommended CSS edit.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   CSS edit will give you just a spyglass on what a style sheet is doing and how it's
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.080]   interacting with any web page.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.120]   And I didn't have to download the style sheets off of my blog to work with them.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.760]   Can you edit them in place?
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.640]   You can edit, you launch CSS edit, give it the URL of the web page you want to take a
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   look at.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.440]   It will open up that web page in a live browser and then open up, here's what all the style
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.600]   sheets look like.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.280]   And even if you can't figure out what style sheet you're looking at, you simply click
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.120]   on a paragraph and then it will highlight it, locate its entry in its little database
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:02.040]   of style sheets and say, "Oh, this is called page 4 H2 style."
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.400]   And then you can edit it live and you will see immediately the impact of changing these
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.480]   style sheets.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.400]   And of course, this won't work just with your own web blog.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.680]   It will work with any web page.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:21.040]   If you want to see what would CNN.com look like if they're using SCIA for all of its
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.040]   text, well you can open up CNN.com and in CSS edit and it will apply its own style sheets,
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.680]   override everything that you want.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.120]   And you can really mess around easily that way.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.960]   You can easily figure out exactly how you want the things to work.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.440]   I've been using it so often over the past four days.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.680]   I long went past the idea of just editing the style sheets on this one blog.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.080]   Now if there's ever a blog that has, "Wow, that's a really cool effect they're using
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.520]   for that sort of header," I wonder how they're doing that, you simply open it up in CSS edit
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.920]   and it will select that header and it will give you all the code you need in order to
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.240]   replicate that on your own site.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.120]   It really is the, it's just 30 bucks.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.840]   It's from MacRabbit.com.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.720]   It really is the difference between my sort of being resigned to the idea of just using
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.120]   so-and-else's pre-fab WordPress template.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.480]   Am I thinking, "No, I can just roll my own from the ground up.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480]   That'll be easy.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.480]   No problem with CSS edit.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.840]   I can just keep messing around with it until I got what I want."
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.200]   And so it really is a wonderful, wonderful app.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.040]   It's almost a magical app.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.120]   It's exactly the sort of thing that you don't think could possibly exist because no, that's
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.520]   just too profoundly simple.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.440]   The idea of just clicking on a link, clicking on a piece of text and revealing what the
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.480]   style sheet is and editing it live.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.880]   No, no one's done that, but yep, it turns out that the good folks at MacRabbit have done
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880]   that.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   I'm playing with it right now.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:38.880]   It's actually very cool.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   I was-
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.520]   Yeah, I was actually going to be one of my other choices for a pick this week and I was
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.760]   trolling through my application folder and saw that but I thought it had been done already.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.480]   Well, you know, we've been using CODA from Panic Software.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.920]   That was a Merlin recommendation for some time.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.360]   CODA has a very nice CSS editor but what it doesn't have is this great.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   Yeah, CODA is more of a general purpose application.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.720]   You can do five different things with CODA whereas CSS at Excel is doing CSS.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   Very neat.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.000]   Yeah, I really think the difference is that it's a tool for people who don't really understand
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   or love CSS.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.280]   It's for people who just want to get results.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.840]   It's a great application for taking something that can be rather complicated and just reducing
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.200]   it to the simplest, barest bones of utility.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.720]   I'm playing with my blog right now and it's so cool.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.200]   All right, very neat.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.720]   It's $30 and it looks like a goodbye.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.240]   CSS edit and the website is macrabbit.com.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.120]   Not to be confused with macalope.com.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.120]   You don't post a Macalope.com.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.960]   Although some of it done with CSS edit.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   Really?
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   Oh, there you go.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:41.960]   You don't post a Macalope any longer.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.960]   I haven't.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.560]   I need to get on that.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.760]   Well, no, because you have your z-net blog.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   I know.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760]   Or c-net.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.720]   But the kids want more.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.400]   Okay, you know, you could put like a post that says, "If you want to read more macalope,
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   go to my c-net blog."
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.920]   Instead of, "I haven't said anything since August 25th."
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.920]   Does it say that?
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.400]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.000]   Well, the last post just says, "Boom!"
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   And that's it.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.520]   And you should probably say, "You know, you want to read more macalope?
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.040]   I'm over here now."
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   Right?
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.680]   This is why I come on this podcast.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.680]   See?
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.680]   It's just, it's just that simple.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.680]   For helpful hints.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.320]   You can call me the wig of knowledge.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.760]   All right, I had three things that I could have used.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.000]   And I let you all go first because I want to let any of you pick any of those three
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   things.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   Nobody picked any of the three.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.560]   So now I have this problem.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.720]   I don't know which one to do.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   I guess I'll save some for later.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.560]   But I think I should probably mention this one now because it's useful now and it may
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.520]   not be useful sometime down the road.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.440]   It's called iPhone Drive.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.320]   I don't know if any of you have seen this.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:54.520]   But it's from Ecamm, the folks who do actually a very nice driver, Ecamm.com, I believe it
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   is.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:02.400]   They do a Cam driver, a USB check driver for, a Cam driver for Mac, which is very handy.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.440]   But their iPhone Drive finally turns on.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.840]   The one thing I've missed the most with my iPhone and also works with the iPod Touch,
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.160]   hard drive mode.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:16.640]   So you can copy files off of your iPhone and onto your iPhone just as if it's a mounted
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.640]   drive.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.400]   It's got an iTunes-like interface.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.960]   The free version limits itself to a certain number of files, but it's not very expensive
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.880]   if you'd like to buy it.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.680]   It's only $10.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:34.760]   And I find it very useful for pulling stuff off of my iPhone.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.320]   And have you updated the 1.1.1?
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   Yes.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320]   And it works.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320]   And this doesn't really...
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.360]   I'd be willing to guess it's just pretending it's iTunes or something.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.520]   I don't know how it works.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.720]   It's magic.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.320]   Now, you can't...
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.200]   And this is a little bit of a caveat.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.600]   You can't access files that you store on the iPhone.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.960]   In other words, you can't move...
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.960]   I was so excited.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.600]   I thought, "Oh, I can move my ringtones over something."
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.960]   No, it's just using it as a storage medium.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.400]   But you can use the space as a storage.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.880]   It has a data storage area.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.080]   But you can recover stuff from your iPhone, your photos and your music.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.840]   You can just copy right over from your iPhone.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.080]   So it's kind of the ability to copy stuff off the iPhone, even into iTunes.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:18.440]   It has a copy to iTunes button, as well as store stuff on the iPhone, but not access
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.400]   to stuff you've stored, if that makes sense.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.120]   So it just creates a brand new directory just for iPhone drive inside there.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.360]   Yeah, it's really helpful because people have been using things like Sonudi, for example,
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.360]   to get things off their iPod.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.560]   But you couldn't do that with touch or the iPhone.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.840]   But now you finally can.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.200]   That was on my list of things to talk about, and I chose not to.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.400]   So I'm glad you picked...
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   Well, I was leaving it open in case anybody wanted to.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.880]   I have some other things.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   I should...
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880]   All right, all right, all right.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.160]   A freebie, an extra one because I love this program so much.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.160]   Smile on my Mac has updated TextExpander to 2.0 and some nice new features.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.800]   If you're a TextExpander user, I know many of you are because it was a pick some time
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:02.720]   ago, you might want to look at upgrading to 2.01 now, actually, of a TextExpander.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.760]   Now you can have snippet groups, which is handy.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.040]   A lot of nice, a lot of nice little features in it.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.240]   And it has that little sound when you type stuff in.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.160]   I actually use both TypeIt for me and TextExpander.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.800]   I'm non-committal on that.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:21.400]   But if you're a TextExpander user, you really ought to take a look.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:26.280]   And I see they have my name right in the front of it, so I better say good things about it.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.560]   So there's two picks for you.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.320]   Smile on my Mac.com for the TextExpander.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.680]   Upgrade free to existing TextExpander customers.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:39.160]   And for $10, finally, you can copy stuff off your eye touch and your iPhone with iPhone
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.160]   drive.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.160]   And that is from E-Can.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.480]   Don't admit to Apple that you use it.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.440]   Well, you know, it's funny how they won't.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.440]   They won't.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.520]   They consider that a...
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]   Do they?
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   No.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.040]   Well, at least that's one person online who...
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.000]   If I bring what's gone into the...
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.320]   Somehow he managed to...
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:04.520]   I think he bricked his phone before the update and went into Apple and looked for help and
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.200]   let it flip that he used that and they said, "Sorry."
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.000]   Well, you know, they can tell because you have a new directory on your phone.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.680]   So maybe I should recommend again.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.880]   I'm so skittish boy and that's too bad, you know?
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.600]   You should be able to do things like this.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.560]   And I'm so skittish now that either I'll be bricked or I'll be shunned.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.920]   I don't want to be shunned.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.400]   Brick me before you shun me.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.280]   You'd rather be bricked than shunned.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.480]   I would rather be shunned and just leave my skull where it is.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.800]   I mean, I was a geek in high school.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800]   I'm used to being shunned.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.520]   It's part of the landscape.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.240]   Hey, I'm so glad you all were here.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:44.920]   We did lose Alex Lindsay as part of the way through and he never came back.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.280]   But it was good to have him on at the beginning.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:51.400]   Of course, pixelcore.com is Alex's place on the internet, pixelcore.tv for the podcast.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.640]   Do you know, Scott Born, what the state of gear media tech is?
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.800]   We had an 18 week show run and we had a sponsor for 18 weeks.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   We did 18 weeks.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   We're done.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   Okay.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   Show over.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   Show over, man.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800]   Another one, though.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   You never know.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:11.600]   There's no rule that says podcasts have to go on and on and on.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.600]   No.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.520]   Although we are in our second hour now of this show.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.000]   So yes, we are.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Thank you.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.920]   Scott Born is at iPhone.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:25.160]   I mean, applephoneshow.com and also don't forget girls gone geek.tv.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160]   Girls gone geek.tv.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:32.120]   Where there's some great girls and great geeks and great gadgets.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.200]   We need to have some of them on this show.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.200]   And Padango.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.520]   We should all, we should all, they're welcome to come on.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.720]   You just tell me which ones you want to have on.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   Okay.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.720]   Let's set it up.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.360]   And let's mention blog world is coming up and we're going to.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360]   That's right.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.320]   Our crew, we're all going to be down there.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.960]   We're the speakers at the podcasting track at blog world Expo November 7th and 8th and
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   Las Vegas.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   8th and 9th.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   8th and 9th.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.720]   And I'm speaking at the 9th on the cult of the blog at I think 10.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.080]   You're doing one of the keynote, Sleeve.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.040]   Is that a keynote or is it a session?
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.760]   No, you're doing a keynote, my friend.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.560]   Oh, shoot, I better start writing it then.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.160]   I'm just doing, I'm just doing like a schmo session.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.160]   I could do session.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.160]   I'm doing a session.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.160]   You're doing a key.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.040]   I don't prepare for sessions, but keynotes I've got to.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:17.240]   Yeah, actually, you know, I have, I have, I have gleaned some brilliant, yeah, pants
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.120]   definitely unless you have a podium.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.320]   Maybe I could just stand by the podium.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.320]   That might be easier or a killed.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.320]   Exactly.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.320]   Cut the difference.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.640]   We'll get you a totally killed.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.800]   Oh, look, I'm on the, I'm on the front page right there.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Look at that.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.120]   Next up in between Brian Clark and Mike Errington.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:38.240]   We got to go to the, we got to go to the Rio seafood buffet after you're done talking.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.840]   Here, that's really good.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   So that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.560]   That's a two day expo in Las Vegas for bloggers and new media folks and podcasting is going
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.120]   to be a big part of that I think this year.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.200]   Lisa, if Lisa Scott and I have anything to do with it.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.440]   Well, there's, there's, the rest of the Alex is coming.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.920]   Craig Seaver soon is coming.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.920]   It's going to be good.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.920]   A lot of sessions.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.680]   So Lee Gibbons from Pedango is going to be there.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.760]   Lee Analie, who, one of the girls gone, Gee girls is going to be there.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.760]   Oh, well, there you go.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.720]   Maybe we should just do a Mac break weekly out there.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:08.960]   Let's do a Mac break weekly out there.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960]   There you go.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:16.640]   Deal November 8th, ninth for more information blog world expo.com.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.160]   And Chris Breen is at the Apple phone show, of course, an iLife zone as well, but you
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.320]   can read him in the Mac 711 column.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   I split the difference.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   I hope that's okay.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.320]   Perfect.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.400]   The Mac 711 column on, no, it's 911.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   911.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   911.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.400]   911.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   911.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400]   You can't really get to metric.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.400]   Again, Leo.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:43.760]   You know, metric was invented on this day in 1909 by the French.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.320]   I'm quite a stick that counter a bunch of her Christmas with family.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.360]   I just think it's funny that the French invented the metric system.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.160]   Actually, just to annoy.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   Just to annoy.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.280]   We're going to make sure that no wrench ever fits any nuts.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.640]   Fricking English there.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.360]   Never, never work again.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360]   Let's see.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   What else?
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.360]   Actually, it wasn't 1909.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.360]   I think it was like during the French Revolution.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.360]   Yeah, it was older than I was older.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.080]   It was like 1789.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   That's the Macelope.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   He's a genius.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.240]   Oh, right.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.520]   And he has a full head of hair.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.680]   A little head of my own hair.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.840]   Lest we forget.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.320]   And you can catch the Macelope round.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.320]   Brown and furry.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.320]   His new is don't go to macelope.com.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.760]   I'll catch something up there.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   You could go right after this.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.320]   But it'd be very quiet.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.880]   It's the sound of crickets.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.360]   That's what I should put up.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.360]   That's a good idea.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   A little wave file.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.480]   I'm normally against a sound on the web.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.640]   But that's one exception.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.480]   Because there's nowhere on the page that says where to go.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.560]   Well, I think the post before that does it.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.160]   I'll link to the new RSS feed, but that's not the same as a page.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   Okay.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   All right.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160]   If you're wondering where the money went.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160]   I'm irudibly chasing.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.520]   No, I'm not chasing you.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   Just at cnet.com/4793114 underscore three slash two.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.040]   No, you can just go to the last Mac.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.880]   Mine spring dot one.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.080]   And then you get a 404 which goes to Andy.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.080]   There you go.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:22.040]   The king of 404s and the inotco at cwob.com soon to be his own personal site yet.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040]   Yes.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.760]   Well, it's always been my own personal site.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.360]   But you know, but having, I don't want to say anymore because I'll give away the show.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.480]   Well, you're already giving away the show.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.720]   Have I just given away the show?
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.160]   Don't we give it away every week?
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Oh, first show.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.160]   No, no.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160]   It's free.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:44.360]   The URL is absolutely, it's so cleverly constructed that no one will ever guess what
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.360]   Andy and I go super secret.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:51.160]   Blog is, is, is, is, I certainly haven't disabled.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.560]   I certainly haven't done anything like hidden it from Technerati.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.560]   No.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.760]   The only reason why I hope I don't sound like it being coins just that I still want to
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.480]   figure out what I'm going to do with the RSS feed where they're going to have it done
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.760]   by feet burner or something else.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.440]   So I'm just afraid that there's people going to bookmark it and then whoa,
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440]   disappeared.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.440]   It's not official.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.880]   Also, it sometimes looks like crap as I try to figure out, gee, what happens if I do
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880]   this?
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   The place where CSS edit.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   No.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.880]   Well, actually that's what I like about CSS edit is it is it's not, I mean, I've been
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.560]   actually have it playing with it live, but this isn't live and then you can upload it
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.760]   after that, right?
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.080]   It's non damaging until you decide you want to see you actually make a permanent change.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.320]   A lot of people come to my page and watch, you know, like all of a sudden, the background
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.080]   emerge from the back to the front.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.480]   You know, and so now this way I can do it without harming anyone.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.440]   Also Chicago Sun Time is a great place to catch Andy and Akko's writings.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.800]   A good place to be.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:46.320]   Chris, Andy, Scott, Mr. Lope and Alex Lindsay.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.560]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.760]   We'll see you next time as we get ready for leopard, another Mac Break is broke.

[01:27:53.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   [Music]
