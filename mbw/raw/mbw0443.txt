[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers Mac and Tash and Apple News all over
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.880]   the place.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.720]   Joining us as always from bitterly cold Montreal where he hasn't seen a temperature above
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.360]   zero in weeks, Mr. Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.160]   I forgot the temperature has come in the positive layout.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.000]   Well negative, as a centigrator Celsius, would you tell me?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   We say Celsius.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Okay.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Because it's fair and high.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Centigrade sounds more formal.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.360]   Since Mr. Fahrenheit gets acknowledgement for his scale, Mr. Celsius should get acknowledgement
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360]   for his.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.280]   I'm pretty sure Andy and I are switching to Kelvin.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.760]   In metric, it should be centigrade because that feels more metric.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.200]   It does. It feels more European too.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.240]   The only reason I ask is I was listening to a book, this biography, The Beatles, that
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   Andy recommend.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   Hi Andy, Naco, Chicago sometimes.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   Hello there.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   Good to see you.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.880]   And we've got two people on fields of white.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Snowed Out Pittsburgh.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   It's still the snow.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   We haven't gotten.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.720]   We haven't gotten rid of it yet.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.600]   We're sharing one studio for warmth. We're trying to create the illusion that these are
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   two separate studios.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Oh, that's good.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   They're huddled.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.000]   Like near the end of times, communities tend to clutter together so that they don't
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   expect to survive together, but they can see the end through with somebody else.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.840]   And it's, and you know, it's a three dog night.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   Makes the central decision.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   Three show was easier.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   You have to huddle.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.440]   No, I was just saying this Beatles book, they said centigrade and I would wait a minute.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   Whoa.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   I thought it was Celsius.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.880]   So do you think in the UK they still say centigrade?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.320]   Graded by hundreds. Is that what that means?
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.960]   Yeah, no, I don't know.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.480]   Because yeah, because it is zero to 100.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120]   100 is boiling, zero is freezing.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.320]   Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.520]   Yeah, what's Fahrenheit scale based on?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.680]   You know, that's a really good question.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   No idea.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   212 is boiling.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.520]   32 is freezing.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520]   What is that?
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.920]   What does that mean?
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   Where did that come from?
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.320]   It was designed to improve memories in early students.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.800]   Exactly.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.760]   Ladies, gentlemen, Apple is now double the size of Exxon.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.120]   And growing and growing.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.240]   Actually, the stock went down a little this morning, but I was just kind of stunned as
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.600]   the stock continues to just climb.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   How long before Apple's back at 200 after a seven for one split?
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.640]   300, 400 is the sky the limit.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.080]   The stock market loves Apple.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   A market cap for Apple now.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   765 billion dollars.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.200]   Apple is worth at least double any other publicly traded US company.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.960]   And a lot of this is just making up for undervaluation that occurred previously.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.240]   It was never at Amazon levels when you had the price earnings ratio or things like that.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.960]   It's been chronically suppressed as a wrong word because the stock market makes no sense
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.880]   to any rational person and is probably closer akin to gambling than it is to any mathematical
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   fashion.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   Yeah, I don't really.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.360]   But a lot of stocks that a lot of companies that made less money and had less growth,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.760]   had much higher valuations than Apple by proportion.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.680]   And now Apple is gaining some of that.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.160]   $22 at the time of recording per share.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.000]   I wonder, of course, I guess we have to pop a bottle of champagne if they make a trillion
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   dollar company.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.440]   I don't think it's a question of whether they're going to.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.640]   I think it's a question of when.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.880]   I mean, I think that's more of, I mean, they are definitely on that trajectory.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.560]   Boy, I am really starting to regret my recommendation three years ago that everybody sell their
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.360]   Apple stock because it's good guarantee.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.920]   No regret not buying it when they sold Leo.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.120]   I'm not allowed to buy.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.560]   I don't allow myself to buy.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.400]   So I don't have it's it's only the others I've hurt.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   Shell companies.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Bonds.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.920]   Actually, I, you know, for all I do have mutual funds in my retirement and I don't check
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.800]   what they what they're made up of for that reason.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.040]   But it's possible I somewhere have some Apple stock.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040]   Cow Lee.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   Cow Lee.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.160]   Now, get ready because all the smart watches are coming.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.360]   The last minute smart watches are coming.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.280]   Pebble has announced a new one with a color screen.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.720]   Pebble said that they had sold, you know, they didn't say exactly sell.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.120]   Sound like they have a million watches in the channel is what it sounded like when they
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.120]   released that information.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.040]   I hired the WebOS guys.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.120]   Mark Gurman had that on nine to five Mac a couple days ago.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   WebOS guys.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   Yeah, just to rejuvenate their operating system.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.920]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   The color screen watch.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.280]   And they're going to do it on Kickstarter.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.880]   Wait a minute, they don't have enough money to do this.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.360]   Yeah, they did.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.560]   They did say that despite the fact that we've pushed all these watches, we're still very,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.800]   very small company with not a whole lot of resources.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.320]   Plus, if you've got all these people who will easily fund you.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Why not?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.520]   In 30 minutes, go ahead.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.280]   It's a welcome to 2015.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.600]   I first pebble.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   The first pebble.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   Wow, they're already at four point seven million.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.480]   The first pebble was very famous.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.800]   Back in 2012 when Kickstarter was just discovering the world and the world was just discovering
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   it.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   It raised ten million dollars.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   Say again?
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.720]   I was watching your feed.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   Go ahead.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.640]   Oh, we'll go back to that shot in a second.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.560]   Jason and I have dueling pebble.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.720]   I don't think just doing pebble kickstarters.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.320]   We'll see when they re-fairly with each other.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.320]   So the one that says "E paper watch."
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   It's a super-ama.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   The one on this one.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.560]   We've had the first one that says "E paper watch for iPhone and Android."
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   I actually bought into that one.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   Me too.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   I was a backer.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.240]   I pledged to, as it says, here 125 bucks.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.280]   He made the impulse watch for Blackberry at C.C.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.320]   He was well known in Canada, Eric Michikovsky.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   Oh, really?
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.240]   And then he moved from Waterloo to Palo Alto and made a device that wasn't as future was
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.440]   not as linked to Blackberry as the previous one.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.000]   But the ten million that they raised in that first one got them as a company got them
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   going.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.440]   I remember it took a while to get the watch.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   I can't remember how long.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.880]   It seemed like a year to get the watch, something like that.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.120]   It took me 13 months.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.680]   And now the Pebble time.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.720]   Oh, yeah, because in fact, I originally had a color body and they said, you know, you'll
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.840]   get it faster if you just get the Black one.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   So I changed it.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   I remember now.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   It's all coming back to me.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.640]   So just, you know, I don't know.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   Is that him?
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   Yeah, Eric.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.800]   I'm the founder of Pebble.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.360]   You may remember Pebble from our first campaign where a bunch of you supported our quest.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.360]   They're halfway in one day, they're halfway back to where they were last time.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.880]   We might have been able to watch the watch the number flip over to five million.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.520]   Yeah, we're watching it in live real time.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   That's me.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.480]   It's nice to have $750 billion in equity.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.960]   But when you have the ability to simply say, Hi guys, can you preorder our watch?
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.800]   And suddenly you've got five million dollars.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.320]   That's an indication that they got some time to figure out how to compete with Android
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.800]   Wear and Apple.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.280]   I thought it was kind of interesting that they're going for a $200 color watch that's
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.360]   a little bit more interactive.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.120]   That's something that's closer to Android Wear and closer to Apple Watch.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.480]   One of the, I think best moves they made last year was to say we will have a $99 monochrome
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.160]   watch so that we're going to leverage off of all the attention that smart watches are
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   going to get.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.760]   But we're going to give you something that people are just going to say, I got 100 bucks
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.440]   isn't nothing, but I got 100 bucks.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.880]   I don't have to really think as much about my first device of this kind being a $100 device
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.120]   as opposed to my first device of this kind being a $350 device.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.760]   I just think someone at Apple heard Andy tell them they should kickstart of the Apple
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   car.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   You know what?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   How much would they raise?
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.240]   They'd raise a billion dollars.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   Easy.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   They would.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.080]   They get so many presales that do you think that they would not sell 5,000 cars instantly
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   at least.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.080]   You will be the first 5,000 one.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.520]   It does raise this question of what is kickstarter anymore.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.440]   If it's, is it now just a presale site?
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   As opposed to.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.560]   I think a lot, a lot of people have considered it a promotional site.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.920]   We've definitely worked with some folks who shoot videos and so on and so forth.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   They have the money to do it.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.480]   They are using it because it's a great promotional platform as well as, you know, guaranteeing
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.920]   a little bit more certainty over exactly how many they should make in the first run.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.680]   In many cases, the amount raised even when you get to these giant stratospheric numbers
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.320]   isn't sufficient to make the watch or make a success of the watch.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.400]   It's just, it's just seed money.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.160]   Even a $10 million or five.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.160]   You want to run?
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.040]   So again, it lets them, it lets them really define a first run.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   There you go.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   It's just pressed $5 million.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.520]   You know, they know that that was fast.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.480]   While we were watching.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.000]   Holy cow.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.720]   Maybe I better get into this project before it closes.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.760]   Now by observing this, we have changed this right now.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.440]   Everyone at Twitter is donating right now.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   So that's, that's why they wouldn't have made it without us.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   Yes.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   They got the Mac break bump.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.640]   It's kind of stunning.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.240]   I mean, it's, it went up today.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.040]   A few hours ago.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   A few hours ago.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   Five billion.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   Couple of hours.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.680]   It really makes me wonder why I'm not pre-selling stuff on Kickstarter myself.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.000]   Oh, can we kickstart in the next week's Mac break?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.560]   Why not?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.080]   Why not?
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.640]   I'm leaving money on the table.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.600]   So the minimum pledge is $159 and then you get your choice of a pebble watch in any
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.160]   of three colors.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.200]   It'll be 40 bucks off the retail price.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   That's all now, right.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.560]   That's May 2015.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   That one's all gone.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:59.240]   $179 still has a few left, like $7,067 for the regular $479.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.120]   Two of them, five of them, ten of them.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.920]   I love pebble, but they had to get that best smartwatch you could buy up there like immediately.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   Yeah, last chance.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.160]   And you know, you have time maybe.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.280]   Well, they, you know, they really timed it well at ends March 27th.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.720]   But you probably, you know, they ended right before Apple could possibly be selling the
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   Apple watch.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   Wow.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   All right.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.560]   Well, I'm not to knock them seven days battery life.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.240]   They've done, you know, given the kind of limited things that we've learned that Apple,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.440]   you know, a lot of the things Apple wanted to do at making a health device they couldn't.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.720]   So it's not so much less than an Apple watch in functionality and it's considerably less
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   in price.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.920]   And they have much less API access than Apple does.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.240]   And if you're an Android user, is your, you know, it's that or Android where it's multiple,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240]   it's multi platform.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.800]   The other nice thing is that it's going to be interesting to see how people react to
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.120]   the Apple watch as a wristwatch because the pebble's greatest asset is sometimes the
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.960]   fact that every time you look at the watch, it will tell you what time it is or whatever
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.280]   piece of information you want to put on there because it's e-paper.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.600]   It's always lit.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.440]   Whereas Apple watch and Android where you have to either trade off a lot of battery life
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.560]   or you have to be aware that, okay.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.880]   Yes, I, I, I flipped my wrist exactly the right way and then waited a fraction of a second.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.840]   I'll find out that, okay, well, I actually am late in the time that it took me for this
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.440]   watch to light up.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.720]   There is a new watch coming out.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.160]   I got a, I got an invitation.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.120]   No, I don't know if I'm embargoed on this or not.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   Can you be?
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:39.480]   If somebody sends you an email with information unsolicited, can you say you're embargoed?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.400]   Can you say, but don't tell anybody?
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.080]   You have to agree to the embargo.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.040]   If they send you unsolicited text, it's yours to do with whatever you want to with.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.520]   Well, I don't want to make any enemies.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.920]   So I won't say, well, what the hell?
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.200]   This is another smart watch.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.040]   This one, this is an event they're having.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.960]   Actually, there's a couple of things coming this week.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.880]   A box comes from Motorola tomorrow, sometime between six and eight.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.680]   We don't know what it is.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   A Moto box.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.280]   It could be super fish.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.560]   Your very own, your very own copy.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.080]   I think it's like just want to make your super fish.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   Lenovo.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.880]   They just want to make sure that like all the tech press is like at home so that when
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.680]   they have the real event in New York, they'll like they get the real scoop.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.640]   Well, I agree to take the box, but I'm not going to be here six to eight AM.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   I'll give it to a Mike Elgin who can open it on tech news today, 10 AM.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.280]   But everybody, you got, I'm sure Andy, you'll be getting a box.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.520]   I have been informed that I will be getting something on Wednesday.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   I don't know.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.000]   It'll be a box or simply an email, but I think they said a box.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.480]   I think they said the box is central, I think, is getting a box.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480]   I think we're getting a box.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   There are two.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.520]   Oh, you're maybe not on the box list.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.360]   I might not be on the box list as long as I get the information that's really all in.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.280]   Yeah, I don't really need the box.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.040]   Anyway, I'm assuming it's a replacement for the Moto 360.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.440]   It's too early for a Moto X phone.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.000]   I think it's going to be a 360 or a plug.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Moto 720.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.720]   It's pretty funny, though, that they really are taking a page off of Apple here where
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.040]   there's the announcement.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.200]   It has this curious phrase that invites you to try to unwrap it and try to figure out,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.240]   "Oh, do they mean this is going to be a VR goggle set?
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.280]   Is it going to be a new better screen for the Moto G?"
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   It's Apple.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.400]   There's a lot of good stuff to steal from Apple.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.120]   Those are just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.280]   And then I got an interesting invitation for an event Thursday in San Francisco featuring
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.760]   the Red Violin from the movie, the Red Strata various Violin, played by its owner, Elizabeth
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.240]   Pitcairn, which would be wonderful just to see that.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.960]   But it came from Philippe Kahn and the Motion X folks.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.480]   And it's a horological smartwatch.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.360]   We've seen this attempt before, or at least we've heard news of attempts by the Swiss watch
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.000]   makers to make smart watches that are also watches.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.880]   By the horologists?
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.400]   They're horologists.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.600]   Their brands will be Alpina, Frederic, Costan, and Mondaine, all three well-known brands.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.200]   I'm not sure what exactly this is going to be.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.680]   Helvetica.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.160]   That's a beautiful watch, isn't it?
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.960]   So this, oh, wouldn't you love that, the Swiss Railway watch?
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.200]   Look, just like your Apple clock.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   Not anymore.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.480]   I have the real thing.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   Do you?
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.160]   Yeah, it was like my favorite watch until I got the Moto 360.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   It's so beautiful.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160]   Look at that.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   The Swiss Rail.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.360]   So they're going to make, they're going to be one of the partners in this.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:41.040]   If you go to mnt.ch, m, I'm sorry, mmt.ch.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   This is the watch.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.480]   So I don't know exactly what we're going to see here.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480]   But this is another one.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:53.280]   I think if you are a smart watch manufacturer, you darn well better get this thing out.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.400]   These Rolex guys aren't just going to walk in, Leo.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840]   I am.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.480]   I'm very curious.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.560]   I think there are people who would want a watch that is more of an heirloom, more like
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.720]   a Mondaine than one that's a computer on your wrist.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   But there's all kinds.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.960]   The world is full of all kinds of people.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.200]   Diversity is good.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.480]   It's a square pillow, but there are other watches that are shaped like square pillow.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.240]   So that's not a, that's not a, nothing.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.200]   Time is a flat circle, Alec.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   Andy.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.680]   Lunchtime, doubly so.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.080]   The mmt, horological watch platform, I guess is what this is.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.600]   It's a watch platform.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Oh, good.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   Of course it is.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   That's even better than a watch.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.080]   I was hoping to have a platform on my wrist.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.440]   I watch this for a tiny elephant, like a really.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.520]   Android Wear is a platform, right?
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.360]   And that's why I wonder what, what Motorola could do because Wear is tightly controlled
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.520]   by Google.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.960]   All Android Wear watches have basically the same software, right?
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.640]   I think it's just one getting some attention.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.840]   Is there, is that out yet?
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.680]   As another, another round dial, they basically took the guts of the one that they released
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.280]   with that fake number ring around it and put into a much, much smaller and classier case.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.640]   It's called a Petra.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.240]   It really looks, it really looks very, very smart.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.880]   And it had in front of me.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.440]   I'm sorry, the LG watch Urbain.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.840]   Well, the Urbain is very nice too.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.520]   Yeah, I like the Urbain.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.640]   LG did the round one, the gear R. Right.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.720]   And then HTC is doing soon.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.320]   He's doing a watch.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.120]   They sent out invitations last fall.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   People went to see it.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   Did you, anybody see it?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.560]   I didn't see it.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.480]   But it was the Sony smart watch three that Dieter Bowen reviewed.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   That was funny.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.800]   Not funny, but interesting.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.960]   I feel like, I feel like this is it.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.600]   This is two months, gentlemen.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.080]   But then really, I also feel like the, at least Andrew Weir is a mature platform that
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   is very usable.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.680]   I said, I got it received a text this morning on my watch and responded to it by talking
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   to my watch.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   And it was very convenient.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.040]   It's just a blessing the curse of Android.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.280]   It's for everything for phones and for watches that companies who can just use Android.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.640]   And it's better than what they might come up with with their own.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.520]   But it's also means that we won't find any super interesting new technologies.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   Right.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.360]   That's why I like Pebble because at least they're doing something different.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:26.480]   Well, I mean, it's, there's, there's, there's no coin that has a heads, but not a tails.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.320]   So you can't get the idea of a selection of different case styles, different manufacturers
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.840]   without having the limit of having a single reference operating system that can't introduce
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.280]   a brand new hardware platform.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.320]   I don't think it's going to be a long time before we see an Android Wear watch with NFC.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.840]   At the same time, Apple's doing the exact same thing that you always have to do when
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   you buy an Apple.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   Where if you like it, great.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   If you don't like it, go away.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840]   We don't care.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.640]   Here's the, there's the, there's like, you were talking about the video of the year being.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.320]   And unlike the Moto 360, it's fully round, which is the LGRL.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.920]   So this is pretty, and this is metal.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.920]   Looks nice.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.080]   I don't know if it's, I think it might be white metal and it's plated as opposed to
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.120]   something that costs you one semester of your children's college.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.880]   And note the focus on bands once again, which I think was the smart move on Apple's part.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.880]   It's quite pretty.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.240]   It's also, I'm really in love with the idea of a round LCD screen.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.240]   Yeah, me too.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.040]   A square, a square screen is not a deal breaker, but you really do have an immediate emotional
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.800]   connection to a watch that looks like the same watch you've been using for years and
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   years and years.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.400]   And again, there's the Casio G shock is a square screen.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.000]   You know, we've been using square calculator watches since we were in junior high.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.480]   Well, even some fashion, many fashion watches are square.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   Do some swatches.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   Square circles.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.280]   So I know it's not the end of the world that it's a squared circle.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.320]   I think it does create a lot of, I think there is a lot of design challenges, you know,
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.000]   from a not just from the round watch does.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.600]   I mean, for developers and so on and so forth, I think that is the primary argument against
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.080]   the round watch is that it's just a lot harder to develop for.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.520]   It's also a lot more exciting, especially if you're doing something that's focused on
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.120]   being a watch that has digital features on it.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.680]   There was that I don't know who who started circulating it after the Apple watch came
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.600]   out and Apple's now has like a little promotional like here's what the watch faces look like
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.240]   and you're what watch apps look like.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.200]   So and so here's the here's why you should never around smart watch face looks stupid.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.360]   And they just superimposed a circle over this user interface that had been designed for
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.000]   a square screen to begin with.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.240]   And well, what do you know when you try to cram that into a circle, the edges of the
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.560]   buttons get cut off.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:42.680]   But they really is circular, circular, circular screens are a specific alternative that is
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.120]   baked into Android where there are a lot of really cool interfaces that are designed
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.220]   for circles.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.000]   And also, I think that the idea that Android where is based on not here of five different
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.400]   ways of inputting into this watch really is here is a button tap the button or swipe
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   the button.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.840]   I think it really works very nicely.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.720]   I just but I just love that the interest that Apple is bringing to this is floating all
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   boats.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.080]   It is it is an Apple only game.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.440]   You're not going to be able to use the this watch with any other phone and there are other
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.640]   phones out there.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.840]   And the bill that means that people who are getting the attention that everyone is giving
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.720]   to smart watches now has given these other companies like LG like Motorola sort of the
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.960]   guts to say, you know what?
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.480]   Yeah, let's get into this game too, because there are going to be a lot of people with
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:30.120]   money to spend and we want to be there with an open basket when they start throwing around.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.880]   People say making five million according to the supply chain, we had a little poll on
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:42.800]   Twitter on Sunday as to how many of those five million Apple would sell.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.480]   You think they'll sell five million right away first weekend?
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.720]   Yeah, yeah, I'll be constrained.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   It'll be constrained.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.160]   You have to get in line even with five million.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.480]   I mean, it'll be I think that I don't know if they'll sell five million in the first weekend,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.920]   but they'll definitely sell five million in the first three weeks.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.120]   Is there any thought that it might be a disappointment?
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.520]   The Apple Watch might be a disappointment that people absolutely will be for some people.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.760]   I would just that it might be disappointed.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.680]   Another well, buying the rumors sell on the story, right?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.120]   Isn't that the isn't that the old adage in the stock market?
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.880]   Are they buying on the rumor now?
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.960]   Will the stock plummet when the watch comes out?
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.440]   Because in fact, it will not live up to its hype.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.880]   That's what they said about the iPhone and iPad.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.440]   iPhone and iPad both had bad reviews, boring on a imagine.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   It'd be for pocket.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   Where's my MMS?
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440]   Where's my?
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   No apps.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.840]   The first generation product and it's going to have first generation pain.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.680]   Some people will be happy because they get it earlier than if they waited for a couple
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   generations.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.360]   Other people will be content to let it go by and wait until it does everything that they
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   want to do.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.200]   Can well, people just go sight unseen and buy it and wait and not wait to find out if
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.440]   the battery life gets you through a full day or things like that.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.800]   I think a lot of I think a lot of them will.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.920]   I think the first five million people to buy it are going to be the people who because
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.320]   I believe shipments are going to be a little bit constrained.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.160]   Those are going to be people who fought to get one of these things.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.440]   Those aren't just early adopters.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.080]   Those are early believers.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.760]   They are the people like all of us who use the first iPhone that doesn't have cut copy
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.240]   paste, doesn't have apps.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.760]   I don't care because this speaks to me in a very, very fundamental level and I'm willing
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.280]   to limp along with it for a year and a half until they fix these things.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.440]   Max, tags in in our chat room says 200 million Apple Watch compatible devices are out there
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.440]   right now.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.640]   That's five C's, five S's, five six's.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.680]   If he points out, if only a couple of percentage points of them buy it, you've got to sold
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   up to five million.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.800]   It gives people in the US, for example, who have iPhone 5C or iPhone 5 or iPhone 5 S,
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.840]   a gateway to Apple Pay, which previously only had a iPhone 6.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.200]   Eight-way to Apple Pay.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.440]   Yeah, because you can authorize the watch and the watch has NFC and can do the transactions
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440]   for you.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.240]   If you've been thinking about upgrading but you don't want to just yet, but all the stories
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   you use have Apple Pay, it's just another added bonus for you.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.720]   It is a little ironic that Apple was the last company to put an NFC chip in its smartphone
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.560]   and the first company to put an NFC chip in its watch.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.920]   They don't think about chipsets.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.160]   They think about feature sets.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.000]   The Apple Pay to them is a feature and then they'll put the chip in that helps deliver
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   that feature.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.760]   So we agree that they'll probably, I feel like there is a strong potential, not huge,
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.560]   but there's a potential that people will look at the reviews say, "Oh, wait, it doesn't
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.760]   do this, that or the other.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.160]   It doesn't have a good battery, whatever it is."
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   Flash.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   It could slow down sales a little bit, but I think there's just enough people who would
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.600]   just, they'll sell out five million in the first week.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.920]   Well, and I think also there's five million people that just want to be the first ones
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   with the watch.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:34.600]   You know, that one, I mean, it is a, anytime you're the first one with an Apple product,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.720]   you tend to be, and sometimes with a Google product, you tend to be brought up in a conversation
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.040]   and some people want to be part of that.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.880]   So I think there's enough people that just want to do that that you're going to get.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.400]   And the rest will wait for the third generation.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.800]   Yeah, I'd say that in the first quarter, I could see a supply of eight to nine million
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.480]   that would want to buy the watch.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.080]   And then after that, it could slow down a lot without a lot of technological, you know,
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   without new apps.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.880]   And there are so many apps that could be written.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.000]   And it's just a matter of how fast they, you know, how fast those customizations happen.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.840]   We'll heavily affect it.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.840]   That's absolutely right.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.320]   I think the selling point of this is not even necessarily going to be Apple.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.400]   It's going to be all the apps that get written for it.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.440]   And already we're seeing developers show off screenshots of how they're thinking about
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.280]   adapting things to Apple Watch.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.440]   That's going to be the excitement that's going to get the Apple Watch into month two, three,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.960]   four, five, six.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.080]   And also the fact that this is something that I only learned after wearing this Android
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.240]   Wear watch.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.880]   It's a cool watch that even if it just did basic notifications, I like the fact that
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.800]   you have designers who are making beautiful watch faces that I actually enjoy using and
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.600]   can actually switch out for the weekend if I want to.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.160]   If I'm kind of now concerned about what the pipes in my house are going to do, now I've
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.680]   got my watch face as a weather dominated watch face.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.960]   Just as a watch that does nothing but tell time in interesting ways, that's a good $200
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.320]   for a lot of worth of value for a lot of people.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.480]   And once there's some guy or some woman in every office who has one that gets to show
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.160]   it off to people, it's going to be the same effect as, you know, we were probably all
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.480]   at some point the one person that someone knows who has an iPhone, the one person that
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.520]   someone knows who has an iPad.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.440]   I still remember when I showed off my iPad to Roger Ebert for the first time, it was
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.040]   just, you know, let me play with this.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040]   Let me play with that.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   Let me draw on it.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   Let me.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.480]   And that's I was I was selling so many that first week when I was at a conference, when
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.200]   I was the only person at this conference with an iPad.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.800]   I do also think that Apple's been very smart.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.480]   And I'm not sure I support this, but they've been very smart and creating a closed ecosystem.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.120]   You see it with messages that there's a real strong incentive if your friends have iPhones
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.080]   that you get an iPhone so that you can communicate using messages rather than SMS.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.640]   I know the one I'm trying to try.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.560]   And I think you sell one Apple watch, you're going to sell two because there's going to
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.160]   be one other like Lisa has to buy an Apple watch.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.800]   Yeah, Lisa has to buy an Apple watch.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.840]   Otherwise, half of the functionality, the drawing little things won't get your heartbeat,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.680]   Leo won't get my heartbeat.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.560]   So there, this is smart marketing.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   No, but this is smart marketing.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   Oh my God.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.280]   In fact, it goes into a commercial over Apple.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.600]   My spouse can't, my love can't speak of my heartbeat.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.920]   I have to have this watch.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.680]   Oh, no, she has a different watch.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.240]   She can't speak of my heartbeat.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.880]   It's one of those things that's absolutely self-serving, but at the same time, if you
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.600]   don't, if you aren't willing to do that, then you don't like there's no common standard
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.520]   for sending heartbeats over over standardized protocols for internet communication.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   Right.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.200]   So you kind of you they had to invent it, but they didn't have to make the Apple watch
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   iPhone only.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.000]   Well, but the closed system gives Apple, I mean, the obvious marketing, obvious business,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.600]   it also allows them to innovate much faster because they're not having to deal with standards.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.720]   They don't want to deal with outside, you know, folks and trying to figure out how we're
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   going to all talk together.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   They just do it, you know, and so they're able to move faster than, you know, in the
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.320]   areas that they want to because they have that, that closed system.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.960]   It's like the iPhone with Linux, you know, it worked on Mac.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.520]   It worked on PC because it had to, but it never really worked on Linux.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.080]   So it was tethered to a cable.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.440]   Now it doesn't have that tether anymore.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.800]   So you can theoretically use it with any computer you want the Apple watch right now
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.480]   because of energy constraints and other reasons is incredibly tethered to an iPhone and making
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.320]   something that would have that deep integration into Android is not only not an Apple's best
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.960]   interest, but it's not in their expertise or skill set.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   So they can make a watch that were that is basically a little extension, a little broadcast
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.840]   from the iPhone, but as time goes on and it gets more radios and more independence of
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.920]   it all and it'll probably work with any system that you have.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.200]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, why am I upset in agreement?
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.140]   I don't even blame Apple for not showing any interest whatsoever and supporting other
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.560]   phones because why, why would they not only would they have to build an entire new team
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.840]   that, that they don't have, they don't really don't have right now, but also they have to
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.200]   support a platform that is really hard to support in this way.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.600]   It would really only work with the latest version, the latest two versions of Android,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.200]   which is a fraction of the installed base out there.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.840]   And as you say, I mean, why are you helping to for people to decide to buy an Android
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.040]   instead of buying an iPhone?
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.280]   This is what they do so well.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.440]   Also so much of the technology behind Apple Watch are technologies that are built in
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:19.160]   do 70 that are built into iOS and to replicate that experience to create analogs for Android
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   for that.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.520]   Again, you're just, it's, there's an analogy that I really like that's, it's sometimes
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.000]   you're building a car with square wheels.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.680]   And well, how well doesn't it isn't all bumpy?
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.240]   Well, we, we've invented this brand new suspension so that it round, it goes as well as where
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   wheels.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.240]   Well, but weren't the tires like where and evenly?
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.760]   Well, we've come up with this new kind of rubber and like, okay, look at all the stuff
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.760]   you're doing just to make square wheels work.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.160]   Maybe you should just have made round wheels to begin with.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.760]   And I think that square wheels is Android support for Apple Watch.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.760]   Well, I know it's interesting.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.760]   Hold on a second.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.600]   A couple of some great comments in the chat room.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.760]   I want to throw in there and then we'll continue.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.840]   You're next, Alex.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.880]   Everybody points out that Apple, well, Apple Watch, even if Apple Watch didn't do well
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:05.480]   in North America, let's not forget Apple now works in a giant global market in Asia.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.200]   This might be a huge product.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.040]   We don't even know how well it might do.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.320]   Dr. Mom says, this is an interesting point.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.160]   If they make it a closed ecosystem and it's a medical accessory, then you have an ethical
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.040]   conundrum because you're restricting potentially life savings tech to only people who can afford
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   it.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   I don't, I don't know if that's,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   but I had a counterpoint to that.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.680]   Like I was, I interviewed the school in Redwood that is using iPads with children with cochlear
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.240]   implants for training.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.080]   And they weren't allowed to use Skype because Stanford and HIPAA didn't consider it securely
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.720]   encrypted end to end, but FaceTime is securely encrypted end to end.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.040]   So that fit with the health guidelines.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.840]   And that allowed them to have one product that did everything.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.640]   I don't know if anything is that.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.360]   But Apple doing the whole thing can also make it better for some, for some things like HIPAA.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:59.000]   And boy, I might argue that why do you not think Skype is safe and you think FaceTime
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   is?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   That's a story.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.340]   Well, Apple, Apple maintains that FaceTime is end to end encrypted and their security
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.340]   papers.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.340]   You know, Steve Gibson went through all that.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.760]   Skype will tell you that, you know, that they have, that they're working on it, but
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   it's not done yet.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   Skype's encrypted.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   Skype's encrypted.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.840]   It's always been encrypted.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.160]   It's, if you ask the star point of view, I have to say, but if you ask Skype, they
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.120]   can't guarantee, they can't give you the end to end encrypted line that Apple can give
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   you for the protocol.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.040]   And there's a lot of, there's a lot of access that they've given that might not continue
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   in the future.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.440]   And I love Curtis B's comment.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.040]   Once Apple integrates the Apple Watch with CarPlay and the new Apple Car, then your spouse
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.680]   will be able to, you have to feel you revving the engine.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   Now that I would buy it for.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.640]   Is that a double entendre?
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Alex.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.960]   I just wanted to get some of the chat rooms so great to get it.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.880]   What I was saying is that with standardization, Apple's, you know, their general mode of operation
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   is that they look for standards in areas that they're behind and they look at closed
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.880]   systems in areas that they're ahead.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.480]   And that's what we can generally expect from Apple at any moment.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.040]   You know, I think that the thing that's going to be interesting is that we are going to
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:11.760]   see a single operating system in a lot of watches very, very quickly after this is released.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.720]   And the hard part that other developers are going to have is that once one company like
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   Apple has five, six, 10 million people using it, you know, while we've seen a lot of other
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.680]   watches be made, they're all in small numbers.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.120]   Once they get to that big, the entire ecosystem, like everything else that Apple has, it's
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.480]   not just what Apple's doing.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.640]   It's all the developers and, you know, in all the different ways that they can interact
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.120]   with that watch suddenly become commercially viable, you know, and that'll pick up.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.480]   And then it's typically what'll happen is it'll pick up the support Apple.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.960]   Once they start making money with Apple, if the other watches are picking up, then they
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.560]   will go after those markets as well because they've already developed the infrastructure.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:54.040]   But it's hard when there's only 100,000 or 500,000 people using your product to know
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   that you're only going to get 1% of that product.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.840]   Is that going to be enough to generate, you know, a factory run?
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.480]   At 10 million, it becomes more viable.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.680]   Leo, I just double check this quickly.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.240]   So Skype, this is a corner of Wikipedia.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.800]   Skype is not considered to be secure VoIP system and the calls made over the network are routinely
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.920]   monitored by Microsoft and by government agencies.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.280]   So that doesn't fit the hip.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   That's Wikipedia.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.200]   Skype is always using encryption.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.480]   And the presumption is that Microsoft is breaking, which might be.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.440]   But I don't understand why you'd presume that and not presume Apple's doing the same
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   thing.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.040]   I think that that's more of a political point of view than a technical point of view is my
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   point.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   Maybe it is.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.640]   I mean, a FaceTime is, you put just as much trust in Apple with FaceTime as you do with
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.280]   Microsoft with Skype, don't you?
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   Sure.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.880]   But I think that the same information about Skype's encryption is different than the
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.280]   publicly available information about FaceTime's encryption.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.160]   Okay.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.600]   It still feels like an opinion to me.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.200]   You know, I'm actually, let's say Steve Gibson on Wednesday.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   On Tuesday, he's today.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   It's right after the show.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.560]   Steve's watching even because I know he likes to watch his show.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.760]   We'll come back with more in just a second.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.200]   Are you a Sonic youth fan?
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.880]   I feel like Alex Lindsey might be a Sonic youth fan.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.800]   I saw them a long time ago.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.480]   And the reason I asked Kim Gordon's new memoir is just out, Girl in a Band.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.640]   Now I am not, I don't even know who Sonic youth is, but I figure if you are into Sonic
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:24.440]   youth, you're going to want to listen to this on, on on on on on on the adding that Leo.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440]   Okay.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   Sure.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   And she narrates it like right down my alley.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   Really?
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   Your Sonic youth fan.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.480]   Yeah, it wasn't like a uber fan, but I just love these kinds of memoirs like the rock
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.680]   bios and I love them.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:42.440]   You know, Keith Richards, Neil Young's, he tepe townsons.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   I love them.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   I agree with you.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.760]   The couple, everyone believed was golden and normal and eternally intact who gave younger
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.880]   musicians hope they could outlast a crazy rock and roll world was now just another cliche
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   of middle age.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.000]   I think when you're listening to a memoir, I like this is so great when the author is
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   reading it.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Kim Gordon does read this now.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.800]   You could get this book for free, but let's not stop here.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.560]   There are after all 150,000 titles on audible.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.000]   And by the way, when you become an audible member, there are always daily deals like
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.360]   this one, the Prince by Machiavelli.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   It's not very long.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.160]   It'd be hard for them to charge a lot for a four hour, 47 minute gift, but they're doing
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.520]   a daily deal on this for $2.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.600]   Grover gardener who reads is one of my favorite narrators, not an Italian.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   Okay.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   But, but still an audio classic.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.960]   Here's a Grover gardener with a little Machiavelli.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.080]   If you haven't read this recapitulation of his transactions with the statesman and soldiers
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.120]   of his time gives a fair indication of his activities.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.160]   I have to say, so this is something else that happens with audible.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.360]   You become a fan of not just the author, but the reader Grover gardener does the stand.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.880]   Oh, m g 47 hours of Grover gardener.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.960]   You might say what?
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   That's heaven to me.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.600]   This is such a great narration.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.000]   And if that's not long enough, how about Grover gardener reading the rise and fall of the
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.840]   third Reich?
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.120]   57 hours.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.160]   That is that is a book that will keep you busy all summer.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.440]   That's a lot of rising and a lot of fun.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.280]   You know, I read I actually read this in middle school.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.680]   I was so fascinated by the history of reward to I read this.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.400]   There's a lot of skimming because because William L. Shire who wrote it includes a lot
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.080]   of the original documents and he could just skim through all those telegrams, but it is
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   actually really good.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.200]   And if you're a fan, if you're interested at all in history of World War II, this is
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.880]   the definitive story of the Nazi era.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.200]   But this is so history.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.600]   Yeah, classics.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.560]   Yeah, but great fiction too.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:44.280]   I mean, audible if you're into sci fi audible is phenomenal.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.920]   If you haven't read 50 Shades of Grey yet or gone girl, I've been listening to American
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.760]   sniper Chris Kyle's I, you know, I have mixed feelings about the book.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.920]   So I wanted to I mean the movie.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.400]   So I wanted to read the book.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.280]   If you've if you've seen the movie, you must read the book.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.320]   All of this is just fantastic.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:08.480]   If you saw unbroken Laura Hill and brands amazing story that was made into that movie
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.680]   is incredible, a must read.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.040]   I can go on and on.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.720]   Annie, what are you listening to at audible.com?
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.360]   Neil Gaiman has a new book, short stories.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.960]   I got a trigger warning.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.640]   I will I cannot tell you whether I like these short stories or not because I'm sure they're
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:30.200]   great because Neil Gaiman, any audio book Neil Gaiman written, wrote it and Neil Gaiman
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.440]   is reading the book.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.440]   Automatic purchase.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.040]   He's me in the bank.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.200]   Yeah, he's like Gene Hackman in the credits of a movie.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.520]   You're just going to have to see that because it's going to be great.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.440]   There are times you don't want the author to narrate it.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.920]   Not all authors are great readers.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.280]   There's no one better than listen to Neil Gaiman.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.520]   Find them, might disturb them or shake them or make them think something they had never
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.920]   thought before.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.200]   I felt that was their own lookout.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   We are mature.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.720]   We decide what we read.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.960]   He is an actor.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   He's amazing.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   Nope.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.720]   He is he's one of those writers who wrote who read every single book in his shot in the
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.040]   library as a kid.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.680]   He understands every single story and that when you have an author reading their own
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.600]   work, you have an understanding of that story that you can't get elsewhere.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.800]   And the other great thing about this is that we just we've you've just recommended one
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.120]   that a book that takes 54 hours to get through.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   This is a collection of short stories.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   Right.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   So I'm going to be looking at this book.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   I'm going to be looking at this book.

[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   This was a very expensive subscription.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   If you're interested in almost anything they teach in college, including this one, a 12-lecture masterpiece of scientific reporting, the Higgs Boson and beyond.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   Professor Sean Carroll at the California Institute of Technology gives this lecture.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   Learning entertainment.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   It's audible.com/MacBrick.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   It's just so great.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   I can't.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   I can't.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   I have a subscription.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   My mom, my sister have a subscription.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   They just listen to it all the time.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   It's the whole family can enjoy it.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   I love these great courses.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   There's just so much history's greatest voyages of exploration.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.120]   Wow.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   I have Hulu.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   I subscribed to Hulu and Netflix.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.120]   If I ever really needed to economize, I would have to keep Audible.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   Never give me one of those two.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   It was audible.com/MacBrick.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   All right.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   I know we do eight-minute commercials for a book.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   It turns into like we have to talk about books that we love and authors that we love and performances that we love.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   It's like, what can I say?
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   We get an advertiser of like cable claps.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.120]   We just don't have eight minutes.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   We'll read the copy.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   We don't have eight minutes of things to say about your cable claps.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   It's a great clap, but that's all we have to say.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   Is that going to be your pick of the week?
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   I don't have a feeling.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   Damn, I just blew it.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:18.120]   Let's talk about car because we're going to start seeing car play stuff soon, right?
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   Android, same thing.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   Google really wants Android in the car.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   Not necessarily mutually exclusive, but this is a good article in the New York Times this week by Aaron Kessler and Brian X.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   Apple has 200 people working in electric vehicle technology.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   We've been talking about that.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   Google, of course, working as we've known for years on autonomous vehicles.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   For some reason, though, it's the car play or the Android auto that's really going to be the beginning of all.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   Well, both of these sit on top of Q and X, is that right?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   Well, it's because that's the easiest one to layer them on top of.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   Right.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   So I think that the big winner in some ways is Blackberry, of all things.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   Because they aren't there with X.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   Yeah, they bought them.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.120]   Yeah, so Q and X is so Blackberry sits on top of Q and X.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   And so whether you're using Android or iOS, and I think it does give Apple, or not Apple, but the car manufacturers, A, kind of middle ground so they could switch if they need to.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   And they're not committing to one or the other.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   What?
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   Also, I mean, I forget it.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.120]   I was talking to Sam Abulsamied, who was the guy from GM who's doing a lot of their car tech stuff.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   And he was pointing out that the autonomous stuff and the automatic stuff sounds great.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   But it's way in the future.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.120]   Right now, if you have rain or snow or something, those cars are completely comics.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   So it's a beautiful dream, but the stuff like CarPlay and Android Auto are the present.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   They're much more, they're going to be what we use for a long time to come before we get to that.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   And so, I think it's a great thing.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.120]   I think it's a great thing.

[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   I think it's a great thing.

[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:12.360]   I think it's also pushing the demand up for self-driving cars because as you start saying
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.400]   that we can't do that, then people get very, I think that that's really creating a situation
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.120]   where people really want to not drive their car anymore.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.400]   I think that the regulations are important.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.520]   I do think people should not be doing so much with their phone on the car.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.680]   I also think that it is a real, it really starts a cascade that probably is not good
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.120]   for the car industry in the long run.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.640]   I think people will first stop one self-driving cars and one day of self-driving cars.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.120]   They won't want to own them.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.040]   They just want to rent them.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.920]   Before you know it, you have a much smaller demand for cars.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.120]   That's why some people have said to Ford, why are you interested in this?
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   This is going to cut your sales dramatically.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.560]   It's better for, I remember commuting to work for a decade and it was an hour and a half
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:59.240]   commute and I would see people reading newspapers on their steering wheels eating with two hands.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.120]   The distraction thing is real, but the electronics haven't fixed it.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.040]   They've made it either the same or worse.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.120]   My colleague, George, had the same problem I had.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.480]   I rent a car, I go in there, you plug in your phone.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.320]   All you want to do is use your Apple Maps or your Google Maps, but they start playing
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.080]   your iPod music and you try to turn it off and it turns off the voice navigate.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.600]   It's so poorly integrated, but if I could just land at an airport, get in a car and
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.800]   it has Android Auto or it has CarPlay in it and I have my apps, I can press overcast,
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.320]   listen to my podcast, press the mouse button, listen to my navigation, not have to worry
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   about that.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.560]   That to me is a huge win and Alex is a beautiful self-driving future.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.160]   I'll get into the next self-driving car and it'll just have my interface and I won't
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.560]   have to worry about it.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.560]   Dagomar makes a good point.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:45.000]   He says, "You're proposing a Google Chrome car where it just connects to the cloud, it
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.880]   instantly becomes your car as soon as you sign into your Google account.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.520]   I would be in a car like that."
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.520]   I like that.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:56.360]   Dagomar says saying in our chatroom that only 19 states left allow windshield mounts.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:02.480]   So that whole aftermarket thing of mounting a GPS with a suction cup to your windshield,
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   that's gone.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.600]   That's going fast.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:14.400]   I put mine on the ... They have these little ones that pin to your exhaust, your heating
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.080]   element and they just kind of stick into it and you just wedge it in there and then you
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   can set your phone on it.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.280]   That keeps it below the dash.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.680]   There is aftermarket.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   I recommended Ramouts as picked the week at least twice.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   Can't say enough about them.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.360]   And twice now I have upgraded ... I've had this car for a long time, so twice now I've
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   upgraded my phone.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.480]   I did not have to unscrew this thing from the dash.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.880]   You just pay $20 for the thing at the end of the arm you disconnect and put a new one
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.920]   in and can't recommend those mounts highly enough.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   - Which mount?
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.520]   - It's called Rammount R-A-M-mount.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:56.480]   And even when I even have a mount for an iPad Mini or an XS7 tablet, it will ... Whatever
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.200]   you've got, you can mount it to this system, whether you have to mount it to the floor,
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.280]   mount it to the dash.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.440]   You want to switch to a suction cup mount.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   It's all modular.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:12.360]   So I have done time-lapse videos of the Northeast Quarter Amtrak ride from Boston to New York.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.520]   Because I happen to have this, I just suction cup mounted the camera to the side of the
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.200]   window and have this ... It's actually on YouTube somewhere.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.760]   I'll see if I can find it.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.480]   - You're doing it, huh?
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.040]   - The typing that you're hearing right now is me ordering ...
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040]   - Rammount.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   You can basically put this anywhere.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   - It is a very expensive one.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   - It's not in the windshield.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.840]   It can be in the windshield, but you can put it anywhere.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.640]   - Well, it's a whole system, but it has ...
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   - It has any ball mounts.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   - Here it is.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.840]   We're looking at it on the YouTube.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.160]   I'm giving you ...
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.080]   - It's a ball and socket, huh?
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.880]   - This is hardcore.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.320]   This is like we use in the studio.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   - Or whatever you want.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.840]   I actually had a suction cup mounted for the first couple of years until I got tired of
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.640]   having to remove it every time that I want to order drive-through.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   That's what I said.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.360]   That's why I said, "Okay, guess what?
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.360]   We're drilling holes in the dashboard."
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.680]   - Andy doesn't mess around.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.880]   - Well, that's the beauty of those Lincoln town cars.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.120]   You can really pretty much do anything you want.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.120]   Look at this thing.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   This is hardcore.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.680]   - That was my old style.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   - Here he is.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:16.360]   Beloved technology-pundered Anionaco with his camera glued to the train window.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   That's nice.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.160]   - Wait, that's ... I'm sorry.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.680]   That's not Rammount, but I've done it like that.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.680]   - Yeah.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   - Differently.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   I think that comes out a little bit.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   - That's the idea.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.440]   And then somebody here in chat was recommending this aftermarket solution from Pioneer, the
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.360]   AVHX-4600BT, which does support Siri.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.880]   So you could do Siri Eyes Free with Iform 4S or later.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.280]   This is obviously you'd have to mount this here.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.680]   - Pioneer and Parrot both have some good car play aftermarket units.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.600]   As long as your car can take the two double size units.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.760]   - It does say that there are some issues I think with iOS H.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.640]   - There's new ones that have full customers.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   - Okay.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   All right.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.640]   Yeah, they say don't upgrade.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.040]   - No, that's a bad sign though.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   - That's why it's kind of weird.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:08.520]   For the next year, maybe even two, it's going to be profoundly disappointed to either buy
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:14.240]   a car with car play or Google car systems built in or buy a new head that supports that
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.320]   and then find out that, "Well, I don't have many apps that actually work with it and it
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   doesn't actually interface as cleanly as I would like."
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.040]   There are times where I would much rather have a headphone jack that plugs into the phone,
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.400]   which means that as soon as I do that, I have audio as opposed to the Bluetooth, which
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:38.600]   works 70% of the time, maybe 70 times out of 75, but those five times where it does not
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:44.360]   connect and have to manually parrot, it's like, "Oh, damn it."
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:52.200]   And then incoherent drivel in the chat room says he has nice handle.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   The Alpine ILX 007 and also a nice handle.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   - Is this the thrill?
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   - Yeah.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   Is that their slogan?
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.400]   - No, it should be though.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.400]   It should be.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   Let me take a look at this one.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.240]   He says he likes this from Alpine.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   Alpine does do good stuff.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.920]   I like their aftermarket stuff.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.760]   And that's, boy, look how flush that is if you have the right--
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   - Yeah.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.560]   - That's cool, the right hole in your car.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.640]   And this is a CarPlay solution for $800.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.440]   So this is an aftermarket CarPlay solution.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.280]   That's kind of neat.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   I still--
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.120]   - I think if you can't get a dashboard skin that makes it look like the time controls
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.280]   from the DeLorean, I'm not going to buy this deck.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.960]   This is just-- this is a missed opportunity.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.960]   This is money left on the table.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.960]   - Yeah.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.720]   - Jason Snell had a review of one of them and he said it was part of the way there, not
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.560]   all the way there yet, but it makes me feel happy about the future.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.800]   - $800 has been buying a new car.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.280]   - That's about the value of my car.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.280]   - No, Andy, that value of your car is priceless.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.680]   - Oh, yeah, I forgot I did buy that new water pump.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.080]   It's worth buying a little bit of a car.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:01.040]   But do you have to then have a hole in your dashboard of exactly 178 by 100 by 75 and
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.040]   1/2 millimeters?
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.400]   - Like my car won't take it.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   - Right.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   - You just can't put an aftermarket in the car.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   - Right.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   - Yeah.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   - Dump, dump, dump.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.920]   - I guess if it could get one in there, he'd probably take out your airbag to make it fit,
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   but it would feel you to make it.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   - I'm going to get a magnet mount and put an apple watch on my dashboard.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   This is what I'm going to do.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   - That's good because you're going to need to charge it up on your way to the office.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.280]   - Airbag, carplay, airbag, carplay.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.760]   I think I'd choose carplay.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:28.760]   Airbag.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.680]   - So long as they make the knobs into little spikes so that if you do get in a crash,
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.680]   it will be over quickly.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.640]   - Yeah, just be a pointy little spikes.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640]   That'd be good.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:44.120]   - Apple is overhauling the Genius Bar, perhaps one of the most successful retail features
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.480]   of all time.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.000]   They're going to change things a little bit, but this is from Mark German, 16 hours and
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.840]   48 minutes ago.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.840]   That's a good way.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.080]   - It looks so happy in that picture.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   - Hi.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.000]   - Apple's soon, according to Mark, going to make significant changes to the Genius Bar
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   appointments to improve customer experience.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.600]   This will happen March 9th.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:12.000]   The new concierge will replace traditional walk-in Genius Bar appointments.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.440]   Customers seeking Genius Bar assistance can walk into an Apple retail store.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.240]   You'll meet up with a check-in assistant.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.040]   This is currently what happens, and you'll get a specific time to return for an appointment.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.560]   Don't we get that already?
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.040]   - That's what's happening now.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.040]   - Okay.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.000]   - What's changing is the new program, which is this is an Angela R.N.S.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   special.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.920]   Instead, the customer describes the issue to an Apple Store employee who inputs the issue
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.520]   into an updated iPad app using a special algorithm working the application.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.880]   - It's an iPhone actuarial work.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.160]   - I was watching Jeopardy the other night, and Algorithm was an answer.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.600]   What is Algorithm, Alex?
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.320]   - What is Algorithm for 500, Trump?
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:57.480]   - Is your mobile stream as a logarithm?
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   - Algorithm.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   Algorithm.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   - It's not the same as logarithm.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   - It's not the same as logarithm.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.480]   - Algorithm.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:09.280]   - Using a special algorithm, the application provides the customer a wait time based on
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   issue priorities.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.400]   They're going to do triage in the lobby.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.160]   A customer seeking an iPhone screen replacement will be higher in the queue than a customer
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.480]   seeking help with a minor iCloud issue.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.000]   Then you provide a phone number, and Apple will send you three text messages with updates
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.920]   to the wait time first, an initial text message that says you got an appointment, or not
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.600]   actually not you got an appointment, but we've got your request.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:38.720]   The wait time is, the second message will say, "Start heading back to the Apple Store."
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.800]   The third message tells you when your technician is ready and where they are.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.320]   That's a big change.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.720]   - I hope this is true.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:51.320]   This is exactly the sort of thing that the Apple that I know and love would do, because
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.520]   you walk into an Apple Store, you see it often just packed with people milling about waiting
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.600]   for waiting to see the genius.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   This is not just a way to triage people.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.520]   It's a way to encourage them to go.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.760]   Here's an orange Julius here.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.400]   That's a very frost refreshing beverage.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.760]   Why don't you leave our store instead of wait there instead?
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:14.720]   Lease up congestion and we'll let more people mingle around expensive hardware than just
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.640]   have it turning into a big waiting salon.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.640]   - I know.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:24.240]   - Who would not rather wait whatever they want within the vicinity of a mile of them all,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.200]   as opposed to having to hang around and play Angry Birds yet again on an iPad.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.840]   The good news is that if you're, you can still do the I'm online, I'm going to schedule
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.320]   an appointment and get an actual time.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:40.840]   So that, I think this way they handle boat, because I don't want to the uncertainty.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.240]   So I like the Eddie B of going online and say, "We'll see you at 10 a.m. tomorrow."
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.240]   And that's good.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.240]   I know I'm going to see them.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.240]   And they're usually pretty good that way.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:52.160]   - And I know in San Francisco, you got very well trained to never try to show up at the
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   Apple Store unannounced.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.600]   I mean, if you want someone to go to something.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600]   - It was like an hour and a half.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   You were going to sit there.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.120]   But even now, I'm given that every Apple Store is near a shopping area.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.080]   I was talking to Carlaita about this this morning and she was just like, "Oh, this would
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.080]   fix everything."
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.080]   You know, "Bover to her."
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.720]   Because she doesn't want to ever, she never goes into fix her phone because she doesn't
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.280]   have an hour to just sit around and she never knows exactly when she's going to show up.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:18.280]   So the idea that she could go do that and then go run some errands nearby and pick other
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:24.440]   things up and then come back is a huge upgrade for the experience.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:29.000]   - It does worry me though that my problem will be triaged as a lower priority than somebody
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.080]   else's problem to you.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   Your problem is the most important problem.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.000]   - It's like that horrible thing when you go to the emergency room, always say chest
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   pains, right?
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Because I'll get you right through.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.240]   You'll have to say screen break.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240]   You can't see it.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   It's a screen break.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   - Yeah.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.120]   I can't smile with the left side of my face anymore.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   Is that it?
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   - Yeah.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.960]   - I'm just, while I'm here, like I've got this insurance where they just approve every
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   single test.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.080]   So I've just, I've never, I've never out of here in less than three days.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080]   It's just weird.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.000]   - I just, just walk into an emergency room and say, I feel like there's a knot in my
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.320]   chest and I'm having trouble feeling my left arm and you don't even have to fill out paperwork.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.680]   - How about if I just say, I can't breathe.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680]   - Yeah.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.080]   Ever since Michael, I'll pump you on the chest.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   - I'll pump you on the chest.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.080]   - I'll pump you on the chest.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.840]   - I've just had this burning hole in my chest.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.040]   - But what happens if you do that?
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.280]   And then really all it is is you've got a sore thumb.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.320]   Are they going to throw you out?
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   - I'll build you for the cry.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.440]   - No, they, they, you don't want to do it.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   - We've got another test to fix that.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   - You don't want to do it because they, they pump you up with all kinds of drugs and make
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   you stay overnight.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   - Yeah.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   - So.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   - Yeah, Barry, I'm sick to fix that.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   - Oh God.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   They do have ways, don't they?
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.240]   Well, let's say you want to get to the top of the list in the Apple store.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.160]   What would be the, you know, what would, well, the first, the first step is to crack your,
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160]   your, your screen.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.040]   - Apparently just knock it down and then walk in and say it's created and then while you're,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.960]   while they're replacing your screen, I have, I'm having an iCloud problem.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960]   - Yeah.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   It's a good, an iCloud.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   - Incidentally.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.360]   - Apple is going to do an interesting thing.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:12.040]   At least this is the rumor and I'd love to get your thoughts on this confirmation of denial.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:18.400]   They're going to do a public beta for 8.3 starting March.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.920]   And then for iOS 9 in the summer, true?
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:28.040]   They guess they did the public beta with Yosemite and I thought that worked quite well.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.640]   - They had a developer beta on WWDC last year where they included a bug reporter app and
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.000]   they got something like a hundred thousand bug reports.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.560]   The first weekend and the screeners were just swamped and a lot of them apparently were
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.840]   just like random characters input in and sent to Apple.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.080]   So it makes sense to me that if they do this, it's going to be limited the way Mark says
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.080]   that instead of, you know, the account.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080]   - He says it'll be limited to a hundred thousand people.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   - Yeah.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.200]   So that's limited and hopefully there'll be a lot of pre-screening involved because the
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.440]   last thing, the last thing that I want is, you know, three billion bug reports coming
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.800]   in that do nothing but slow down and clog up the system.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.240]   But it is, I mean, it is useful.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.400]   No plan survives contact with the outside world.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.040]   So the sooner you can get that outside world involved, the better you can arguably make
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040]   the software.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.600]   It just depends on whether you have the resources to screen it and then act effectively to triage
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.400]   it and figure out how to make it better going forward.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.760]   - Is iOS 9 code name Monarch?
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.840]   Is that for the new, the next generation iPhone?
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.840]   - Yes.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840]   - Okay.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.840]   - Yeah.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.320]   - We'll see that at WWDC in June and then we'll see it on the phone.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.360]   - So public beta, if that doesn't make a huge amount of sense because it's going to run
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   on new hardware.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.160]   I guess you still have to test it for the older stuff.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.760]   - Well, it'll be the same as the developer previews.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.880]   They're just basically opening up the developer previews to public seeds exactly like they
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.960]   did with Yosemite.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.160]   So like they'll have WWDC, they'll announce it.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.840]   They'll be a developer beta and then sometime after that, there'll be a public seed beta
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.760]   where 100,000 people can get on and test it out.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   - I think that's a good idea.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.120]   Microsoft's doing the same thing with Windows 10 and I think that's a very good idea.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.120]   Not merely to find bugs but to get feedback on features.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.840]   - The biggest problem is how well Apple manages.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.920]   So for example, let's say I'm one of those 100,000 people and I download the beta and
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.360]   then like right now I'm running iOS 8.3.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.600]   It's either 8.2 and 8.3 are both in beta and under 8.3 some of my apps crash immediately
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.320]   and some of them behave weirdly.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.120]   And I would hope that Apple doesn't let me go to the store and leave a negative review
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.080]   for a developer whose app works perfectly fine on release software but doesn't work under
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.160]   the latest beta that I installed three minutes ago.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.120]   So it's just, I think it's a great benefit but I hope that there's checks put in place
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.240]   to make sure that nothing goes awry.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   - And I do think it's important.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.960]   I think the Apple has had a lot of false starts with the first time I've learned not to update
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.440]   when it, I definitely don't set it to auto update and I have a tendency to wait a little
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.720]   bit to just see what phones it breaks and what things it breaks.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.880]   And so I think getting it out in front of a lot of people early will hopefully reduce
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.080]   some of that pain for the early adopters when it's actually released.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.200]   - I've learned though, I mean like the 8.3 beta that went out yesterday when it was available
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.440]   to install over iTunes first for a long time it didn't go OTA and that might be recognition
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.680]   of previous OTA's not being as easy.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.640]   - I'd really like to see Apple move towards the example of Microsoft where they're not
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.640]   very, very coy about new releases.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.960]   They say not only this is not just a developer release if you really want to fly commando
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.600]   style by all means users install this and use it and talk about it and that's where the,
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.240]   and you will often find that the what they show off in January is nowhere close to what
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.560]   they ship in October.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:30.000]   And if we get to see a lot of that, some of that from Apple and saying that it is not
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.840]   a big, it is not the end of the world if we allow ordinary people to use our operating
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.480]   system before it's completely finished.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:41.920]   I don't think that it would go so far as to allow people to really have an influence on
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.560]   design because I think they're emphatically a company that says that we're not doing our
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.520]   jobs as designers if we are letting you tell us how this thing should look and work.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.480]   That was one of the keynote pull quotes from Johnny Ives piece in the New Yorker last week.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.560]   He was complaining about, he didn't mention Motorola specifically but he was speaking
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.440]   about how other makers will have a piece of software that you design the case, choose
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.880]   the colors, choose the trim color and I feel as though this is advocating your responsibility
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   as a designer to simply let people have whatever they want instead of using your skills as
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.600]   a designer to put something together.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.760]   That's why I don't think that if Apple used this sort of system with Yosemite, we would
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.640]   still get the same fonts, we'd still get the same transparency.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.360]   Maybe they would change the level and the intensity of transparency and maybe they would put
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.520]   an options to tone that stuff down but it's good to see them have at least a of awareness
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.520]   of what problems people are going to encounter when they actually ship it to tens of millions
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   of people.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.960]   Let's take a break when we come back more from Mac Break Weekly and I do not go to Chicago
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.320]   Sun Times, Alex Lindsey, the Pittsburgh Penguins.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.440]   No, he's with the Pixel Core.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.920]   I think we're all Penguins on this.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   We're all Penguins on this one.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.920]   Except for me, I'm sitting in the sun.

[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.640]   I'm wearing shorts.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:03.560]   I'm Renee Ritchie in Montreal with iMore.com.

[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   Personal capital.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   It's a new year.

[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.360]   I'm just looking at my portfolio here at this point, seeing what my holdings are, what my
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.920]   balances are, performance.

[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.160]   Portfolio balance is portfolio allocation.

[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.600]   They even have an Android watch app that is spectacular.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.960]   I love getting this information fed to my watch.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   Go to personal capital.

[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:18.200]   Personal capital.com/macbreak, personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.760]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.160]   Appreciate that personal capital.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:32.360]   Siri now knows Russian Danish Dutch Portuguese, Swedish, Thai and Turkish.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.400]   This will be in iOS 8.3 beta 2, really enhancing the languages.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   That's a point of pride for them.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.360]   There's a recent study I forget by who that did a bunch of language tests and show that
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.960]   Apple was getting really good accuracy results on Mandarin and other languages.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.760]   I believe Apple does their own localization for that kind of stuff.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   They're putting a lot of effort into it.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.760]   That's a lot of work.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.640]   It's one thing to add a language to a text on an app, but to add recognition, that's got
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   to be tough.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:06.720]   Yeah, because there is text to speech that goes on and there is voice stuff, but there's
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.880]   also the contextual, the sequential inference system, which realized that I said Leo before.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.240]   Obviously, I'm still talking about Leo now, and this is how Leo relates to everything.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.840]   This is an indication that I want dining directions instead of movie listing.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.640]   There's a lot of dependencies in those frameworks.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.960]   What is the latest with photos?
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.400]   I know you and Serenity did a really great review on iMore about the new app that is coming
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.800]   to replace aperture in Yosemite.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.000]   Of course, we already have photos on iOS, although I presume there'll be a new iOS version as
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.160]   well to tie it together.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.640]   Where are we right now?
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.560]   That's going to be in 10, 10, 3.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.240]   Right now, it's in the 10, 10, 3 beta.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.920]   Apple updated the 10, 10, 3 beta yesterday.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.320]   There was a slight and incremental improvement to a photo.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.080]   It was just the build number changed.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.320]   I didn't notice any new features, but it's a brand new app.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.960]   I'm not anticipating new features and subsequent betas, but yeah, I've been using it going
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.520]   on a month now.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.600]   I don't have my primary photo library in there still.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.440]   That's still sitting on a big drive off of my big computer, but I've put a ton of photos,
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.760]   several thousand photos in there.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.000]   It's working really well.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.080]   The best part is that there's this constant challenge between making it accessible to
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.040]   new people, but making it powerful enough for mainstream, maybe prosumer users.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.280]   That whole idea of, yes, there's a magic wand if all you want to do is make this good,
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.680]   but there's also these three sliders for brightness, for color, and for black and white, which
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.960]   is really easy for humans to relate to.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.080]   If you are a pro, you can open each of those up and do color and do balance or saturation
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:46.320]   or hue or any of the things you would traditionally find in an aperture style program.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.800]   You can close those up if you don't want them.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.640]   You can open up a histogram if that's helpful to you, but you never have to see it if you
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   don't want it.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.400]   In that, I think it's making it really useful for a lot of people.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.920]   Alex, I don't think you've been on since we started talking about this and replacing aperture,
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   or have you?
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.520]   I don't know if I have.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.360]   You were a devoted aperture.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.800]   Yeah, I'm bitter.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800]   Just ask and just question.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   Have you moved to Lightroom?
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.800]   Are you going to try photo?
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]   What are you going to do?
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   Photos?
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.040]   I'm strongly considering moving to Lightroom for a lot of the stuff.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.240]   I think that one of the issues that I had with aperture, actually, and what really killed
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.160]   it is not so much them dropping the support was that going back and looking at some of
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.580]   my older photo libraries, because I had incorporated other aperture libraries in old
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.520]   eye photo libraries.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.880]   I don't think it was doing it correctly.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.440]   One of the basis of aperture was the idea that it's going to keep track of your library
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.160]   and keep track of where all those photos are.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.240]   You don't really have to think about it.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.200]   It's all in a big package.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.200]   That fundamentally doesn't look like it was actually happening very well.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.520]   That was terrifying because you end up with just a bunch of preview images of stuff that
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.360]   you thought you still have full version.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.460]   I had to go back and dig through archives and find them.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:05.820]   That shook my confidence in the idea of a library that is not being managed.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.060]   I don't do that very often.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.900]   A aperture was one of the few places because I trust Apple to do that.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:15.900]   Now I'm looking at more moving to something where it's an external collection that I can
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   control.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.300]   I would love to know what software you end up choosing.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.180]   Most likely it'll be Lightroom because Lightroom likes to do that.
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:25.740]   You really set up your folders and set up how you're going to do it.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.720]   You import them in.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.360]   My sister uses it pretty heavily.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.920]   She's a photographer.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:33.920]   She takes a lot.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.680]   If you go to familiarlight.com, that's her little blog.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.440]   She's an incredible photographer.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.840]   One of the best photographers I know.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.160]   Anyway, she takes a lot of photos.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.560]   She mostly takes photos of her family.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.360]   That's what she does.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.520]   That's what she posts.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.880]   She takes a lot of photos for other people.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.940]   What she attends the post is her kids.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.440]   Was she an aperture user?
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.840]   Did it move to Lightroom or is she always?
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840]   No.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.920]   She started in Lightroom and she just stayed there.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.960]   What plug-in does she use for the monochrome?
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   I don't know.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   I'll ask her.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.840]   It's probably a good conversation to have with her.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.400]   But I'm sure she's not doing anything.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   She's not probably using anything exotic.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.440]   She mostly just uses a lot of skill and a good eye.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   I'm happy with the Lightroom.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.440]   Somebody in the chair was saying this.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.880]   The Lightroom app on the iPad because it syncs to collections on Lightroom.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.560]   That's pretty nice.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.720]   I'm very interested to see what Apple does with the photos on the desktop and photos
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.560]   on iOS because they're supposedly going to be some conversation there.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.560]   Have you got clarification yet, Renee, on the plug-in situation for photos?
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.640]   Yes, because I know a lot of people have been wondering about it.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.600]   The issue with plug-ins right now is that Apple's new plug-in architecture which is
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.920]   built-off extensibility which is a much larger framework is only available for iOS.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.880]   But I think it's impossible for anyone to imagine that that won't be moving to OS X
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.920]   maybe with 10.11 or something else soon because it makes a world of sense for that to be available
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.120]   on OS X as well.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   I just bought the latest version of the Alien Skin Exposure plug-in which is a great plug-in.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:27.880]   This Photoshop and Lightroom have such great support from Nick and from Alien Skin and
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.600]   all these companies that the Silver Effects Pro from Nick is an incredible black and white
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.320]   tool that I feel like that's another argument to go to move towards the Adobe side of the
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   equation.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.880]   There is an open source program I've been playing with called Light Zone.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.440]   If you're price sensitive, although Lightroom plus Photoshop and the Creative Cloud is
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.640]   only $10 a month which is a good deal.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.280]   I subscribe to that it's an amazing value.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.720]   The thing with Photos though is it's a brand new app and you have this twin tension of
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.680]   everyone wanting everything in there immediately and everyone wanting Apple to slow down and
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.680]   make it stable.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680]   Right.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.200]   So in this case they're making the core functionality stable before they add extensibility.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.880]   If they try to do everything at once I think we'd have that situation where people complained
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.000]   on the other side again.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.240]   Also, I really think that Apple's goal is not to, I think they're willing to sacrifice
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:21.880]   a Pro users to Adobe if it means really having a laser focus on the people who are using
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:27.040]   the first or the second most popular camera in the world, i.e. the iPhone.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.480]   This really is optimized for people who are using the phone as the family camera or at
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.120]   best to have a point and shoot and they slap the card in and it really is just for sharing
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.400]   stuff with other people.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.680]   It's so easy, it's so much less fuss and so much less randomness than using Aperture or
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.640]   even iPhoto that you use it for about 30 minutes and you totally get why they're going in
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.640]   the new direction.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.320]   I do think it's a shame that they can't embrace Pro users by continuing development on Aperture
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   as a separate thing but I totally understand where they're getting there.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.440]   This is a really clear statement about here's the user that we really need to spend all
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.640]   of our time taking care of.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.640]   Have you tried Alex?
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.200]   Have you tried this open source light zone?
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   I have not tried it yet.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.200]   You see how they're trying to clone Lightroom when you have a screen.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.840]   I don't think Lightroom, I guess for me, I tend to lean towards them.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.200]   I really want to see competition but when I'm actually using my own photos I tend to want
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.640]   to have something that's working.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.720]   My biggest problem right now is figuring out where to put it on the cloud to back up my
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.640]   entire library which is about two terabytes.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.800]   So that's been me trying to figure out the best place to store it has been my biggest
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.360]   process and that I kind of want everything on the cloud as well as on there and I look
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.400]   right now and you just hit a lot of ceilings.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.880]   So trying to get to four terabytes or five terabytes of total storage is what I'm trying
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.840]   to make sure that I figure out.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.840]   That's a lot.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.120]   Getting cheaper though.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.360]   If you watch the Oscars you saw a couple of things.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.160]   First of all I'll mention the Adobe 25-Ed which I thought was really...
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.800]   Did you guys see that, Abs?
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.800]   Oh.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.800]   Heartstrings Leo.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.040]   Well I don't know about heartstrings it was just a...
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.760]   It just felt like a great ad.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.440]   It was like the triumphal march through a conquered city.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.440]   There are all kinds of things that are photoshop alternatives but they're called photoshop
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.320]   alternatives because there really is just photoshop for this kind of work.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.160]   Oh, just really spectacular.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.600]   They did include some movie posters and movie stills and so forth but it was also just random
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.600]   stuff you could do with photoshop which is...
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.680]   It's just... I mean 25 years is amazing.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.760]   I can't believe they're 25 years old.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   Holy...
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.640]   I was joking that I don't really miss aperture because mostly what I used aperture for was
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.840]   to organize my photo so I could right click and go edit in photoshop.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   Right.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840]   And it's amazing.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:53.240]   I remember when the color palette for photoshop is a very easy decision.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.160]   Do I remember doing the pixels to be black or white?
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160]   Let's see.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.760]   I remember doing the pixel-port tutorials on how to cut out your avatar and stuff.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   That was...
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.920]   We're very specific about our avatar.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.600]   So that was definitely how we...
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.840]   That was definitely...
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.840]   You know, that...
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840]   It was...
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.000]   That's a $2 million half-minute by the way.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.400]   Apple also spent $1.95 million for a half-minute ad on the Oscars.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.520]   This one featuring students from Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.520]   They...
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.840]   Well, I'll show the ad in the beginning of the ad.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.560]   What I didn't realize is this is shot on an iPad.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.800]   And it features a speech somewhere by Martin Scorsese as the soundtrack.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.360]   But this whole thing is shot on an iPad.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.920]   The entire speech is definitely worth watching.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.080]   Where's it from?
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.080]   It's from...
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.280]   He gave a commencement address at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts that he graduated from
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.280]   years and years ago.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.320]   I just put the link in the Google Doc.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.080]   And the entire thing is just...
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   I want...
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.520]   I'm torn between wanting to listen to this entire 30-minute speech and seven minutes in
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.880]   wanting to stop what I'm doing and make something.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.880]   Yes.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   It is just...
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.360]   This is so much stronger, I think, than the Robin Williams voiceover...
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360]   I agree.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.400]   ...did "Potes Society" because that's sort of...
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.200]   It's easy to make fun of the...
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.960]   What will your voice be today?
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   Right.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.160]   Whereas this is the one that's saying, "Look, I don't like the term being live your dreams
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.240]   because if you're dreaming, you're not doing."
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.240]   And so...
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.240]   I'm gonna continue.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.480]   Get out there and do stuff.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.600]   Well, and I think that that is the thing that's really great about some of these ads and this
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.720]   one especially, is that it specifically is not just there to sell you on an iPad.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:39.920]   It is actually encouraging people, "Hey, you can go do that."
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.160]   Here's what you could do that you don't think you can do, but if you had this...
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   ...you know...
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160]   ...just write it to film like that.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.160]   ...and a lot of them already have it.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.760]   And more people that are out there doing it with the iPad.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.200]   I love the iPad.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200]   It's covered with paint.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.200]   It also gets rid of the notion.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.960]   I mean, a lot of people have been very judgmental about people using iPads for photography and
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   for videography.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.480]   And it's got a tremendous viewfinder.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.160]   It's very accessible to a lot of people.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.000]   But would you really...
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   We used it for CES.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   We shot a lot of CES.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Would you really choose...
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   I mean, let's be honest.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.960]   I mean, if you're a lack chef, would you really choose an iPad and make that an assignment?
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   Is that really...
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.280]   I mean, it's a five megapixel camera, right?
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.280]   The new one is eight.
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   Eight, sorry.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.280]   Okay.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.280]   And after all, this commercial was shot on it.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.280]   So...
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.280]   Boy, and I think it's for...
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280]   I'll edit it on it.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.000]   Oh, I bet it was edited on it, right?
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Or was it?
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   I love it.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.400]   I think that should be part of the message, though.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   Samsung also had a commercial about...
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   Who hears this movie?
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   I saw her.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.200]   Shoot a movie and she storyboarded it on a Samsung tablet.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.720]   She shot it on a Note 4.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.040]   And the Note 4 is arguably the best camera you can buy on any mobile device right now,
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.920]   on any mobile phone right now.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.320]   But the thing is, you have to then take that file and put it into Final Cut or to put it
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.560]   probably into an Apple device or...
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.200]   Okay, yes, Windows too.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.120]   But you can't just do it all within the phone, right?
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.080]   So you can even shoot something on an iPhone 6 and cut it together into something that's
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.840]   not much more less complicated than what you're seeing in this commercial.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.840]   It does have that disclaimer.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.840]   Color-grace stuff.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.240]   Additional hardware used, but it is shot on an iPad too, so...
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.400]   Well, they have accessories like they have the mounts and they have...
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   Yeah, like Jib.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.320]   Apple doesn't make its own Jib yet.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.440]   The color grading software, I wasn't familiar with that and that looked great too.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.280]   Now it's all on the iPad.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.800]   And filmmakers featured...
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.840]   I don't know if they did this shot, the behind the scenes footage.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.520]   I think they did.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.600]   And so that's interesting.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.360]   It's also an ad made by high school kids, in effect.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   And I also...
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   I think that it is a really useful thing for teaching because it lowers the iteration,
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   right?
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.800]   When you're shooting your first films, what's important is that you get a lot of experience
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.240]   actually doing it.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.800]   And it's amazing when you're training people how much time they spend and dealing with
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:53.000]   ingestion, dealing with processing, dealing with rather than go shoot it, go do something,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.560]   you know, get it done quickly.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:01.800]   And I think that using an iOS solution or an Android solution, but using something that
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.080]   they have around all the time really makes a lot of sense.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.600]   So it's not just a marketing thing.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.920]   I think it's actually really good from a training perspective.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.560]   It's a great viewfinder.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560]   You can't knock that.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.120]   They do have us as they do with all their ads, a page on the Apple website, changing...
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:23.160]   Apple.com/changing-film that has all the information about the people who shot it, how
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.360]   they did it, and what apps they did use final drafts.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.120]   And there's an extended page on iTunes that gives you a bunch more...
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.560]   The ones that used as well in a bunch of other apps in similar category, which is great.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:38.120]   Video grade was the program that you were talking about to change color saturation.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   You can also meet the students.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.040]   I think that's very, very cool.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.880]   It's not the first time Apple advertised on the Oscars, though.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.400]   They, in fact, advertised the first iPhone in 2007, shortly before it's released.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.400]   Here's the original ad.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.400]   Hello.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   Hello.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   Hello.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   Hello.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.400]   Hello.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]   Hello.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.400]   Hello.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   Hello.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.400]   Hello Barney.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.400]   Hello.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   Hello.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.400]   Hello.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   Hi.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.400]   How you doing there?
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.400]   Yo.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.400]   Hello.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.400]   Hello.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.360]   Now, the acquisition alone must have cost $10 million.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.920]   And there it is.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.320]   That's a great ad.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.120]   Especially for a film buff, right?
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:28.680]   Especially for the Oscars, because that was the time when there would be a montage edit
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.080]   in every, at least maybe even two in every single house broadcast.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.080]   Right.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   Let's see.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   What else?
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.760]   Oh, hey, here's some good news.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.360]   It's been for a year, I've been getting emails from people saying, why won't Apple fix these
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.360]   issues in the MacBook Pros?
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.160]   Why don't you hammer on them?
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:53.880]   Finally, Apple has launched a repair program to fix MacBook Pros sold between February 2011
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:25:00.760]   and February 2013 that have problems with distorted video, no video or unexpected reboots.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.960]   Do check to see, of course, you'll have to fill in your serial numbers.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.160]   This has happened before and Apple recalls to make sure that yours is affected.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.120]   I'm going to check.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   I think mine's affected.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.840]   I have an old one that I had to just pull everything off.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.160]   And so it was, yeah, it's a bummer.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.680]   So there's a really, really glad Apple's done this.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.160]   It took them a long time and people were complaining for an awfully long time.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.280]   Affected products include 15 and 17 inch MacBook Pro models manufactured in 2011 and 15 inch
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.360]   retinomac with Pro Pro models.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.920]   Oh, this is one of them.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:39.600]   Manufactured between mid 2012 and early 2013.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:46.360]   So you go to the check your coverage page, which is self-solved at apple.com and then
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.960]   your hardware serial number.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.960]   Should I do that?
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.680]   I should just check.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.960]   Where's my serial number?
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.800]   I got one of them things I'm definitely checking.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.400]   I don't have any problems.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.160]   I've had a few problems that I can't really explain either it's an old, old, old system
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.600]   folder that the system library that needs to be replaced or it's just an old machine.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:11.800]   But yeah, if there's any chance whatsoever, I can take this completely old machine into
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   an Apple store and come up with something that has at least a new part in it.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   I'm definitely, that's worth the cut and paste, I think.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.720]   Fleet car of computers, Andy.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.920]   Actually you can do this very simply if you go to, thank you for coming over here.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.920]   John Slanino who's done this, you're doing this with probably with all our Macs aren't
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.920]   you?
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:37.440]   You go to about this Mac and if you go to the fourth tab now, service, you can just check,
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.560]   click a link.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:43.320]   This says, check my service and support coverage status.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.640]   It will automatically send your serial number to apple and bring you to this self-solved
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.440]   page and tell you your status.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:57.880]   In my case, it's covered.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.880]   It doesn't say really whether there's anything wrong with it though.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.680]   Would I get a red box or something if it were?
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.520]   Or should I just go back to that original page and see?
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.000]   Yeah, let me copy this serial number and see.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.280]   Check your hardware and I think it's the same information.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.440]   So I presume if there's a recall it would, yeah, it's the same information.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.640]   This is a recall that would tell you.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.640]   Okay.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.720]   So people should probably do that and boy that that's, that makes it as easy as pie.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.080]   Don't bother going to the webpage first.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.760]   Just go to about this Mac and click that fourth tab service.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.440]   Then check, check the link and not a single one of those.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.320]   We'll say super fish on them.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.840]   Ha man.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.520]   Now you know people always complain about why, why do, why do Macs cost so much money?
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.160]   Now you know why.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.400]   You could get a cheap computer but you'd get something else too.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.880]   Poor, I feel sorry.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.080]   I almost said poor Lenovo.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.160]   I don't feel sorry for Lenovo.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.080]   Those guys are morons and they're not a victim.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.080]   They're not a victim.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080]   They're a perpetrator.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.360]   I feel sorry for the people who bought consumer grade Lenovo laptops.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.440]   It's not the high end ones.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.440]   It's the consumer grade ones.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.760]   I think in their press release they were really, really careful to say none of the think pad
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.760]   brand have been affected.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.840]   But the problem is really to show you the problems that occur when you really have to
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.560]   try to make these machines at a budget price.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.960]   That there, if a company offers you a manufacturer X number of dollars per unit to put software
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.240]   or a pre-ship on the device, that's another dollar or two you can make per unit and your
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.160]   margins are very slim to begin with.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.360]   It's a damn shame because one of the great advantages of Windows is that you can buy
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.760]   a decent machine for $60 and find something that doesn't, rest on the Macs.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.880]   The minimum buy in for a notebook is now $900.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.560]   But it's a damn, damn shame.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.800]   And if I were the mayor of technology, I would base and say, "Yeah, we're pulling your license,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   Lenovo.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.760]   You don't get to sell things in my town for the next year."
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:57.640]   And frankly, even though it didn't affect the think pad, you can't recommend the think
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:03.280]   pad anymore because any company that's, whether it's evil or stupid, it doesn't matter.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.880]   Any company that does something like Superfish doesn't deserve your business period.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.080]   The same brand that made the decision made all the other decisions.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.080]   Right.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.360]   The press release was dubious too because the first time it came out they said that there's
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.680]   no, they did it to enhance the customer shopping experience.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.200]   And there was no security concerns.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.440]   And then that was quickly revised.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.440]   And then the CTO, I mean, they said, "The whole thing was, it just made, I stopped buying
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.280]   Sony after rootkit and I'm going to stop."
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   Yep.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.280]   I'm going to deal with Lenovo after this.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.280]   Yep.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.280]   The rootkit and the Sony of music discs was enough to sour a lot of people on Sony and
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.560]   may have something to do with the fact that Sony had to sell its music division.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.560]   And now this.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.120]   And I hope it puts Lenovo out of business.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.440]   I don't, I mean, shocking.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:48.240]   I think that if it's a Tylenol sort of situation where they have one chance to really save
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:55.000]   themselves in their brand and that is to be so absolutely.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.600]   willing to stab themselves in the heart to not only fix what the problem they created
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:04.800]   but also to demonstrate that we didn't just simply say our bad and send out a few $10
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.760]   gift cards to make it up to people.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:13.080]   We've actually done away with the approvals process that led this to happen.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.480]   A certain person that might have to sacrifice a goat in the form of an executive that has
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.480]   to leave the company.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.800]   They're going to have to rebuild trust.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.120]   The Tylenol case is a good example.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.640]   It's different in that they were actually the victims of product tampering from an outside
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.640]   force.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.400]   But they did not wait 10 seconds.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.920]   They said, "We're pulling all of our product off the shelves.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:37.480]   We are introducing brand new product that cannot be tampered with.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.520]   We are disposing with this packaging that was vulnerable."
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.560]   That's why despite the fact that the entire news story for an entire week was that people
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.640]   were getting a tampered product out there, it became, "We took this seriously.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.240]   Now we realize there's a problem.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.640]   You can trust our brand again."
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:56.360]   Lenovo has a long hill to climb.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.960]   No kidding news for Apple though.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.360]   They're just sitting back and saying, "Yep.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360]   Yeah."
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.560]   But that's the thing the company value, some people will buy based.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.560]   Cheapness is the most important feature for them.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.360]   Apple is saying that we want to make this a good experience, the most important feature
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:14.040]   for us and they're willing to put not just their words behind it, but a significant amount
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.040]   of their buying experience behind it.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:20.320]   You can go to Microsoft Store and get Microsoft's signature or get a surface that also doesn't
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.320]   have a sad wear.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.480]   It'll cost a little bit more, but I think the cost is more than made up for by the value
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.480]   of what you get for it.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:30.040]   Well, this underlines what Tim Cook said, which is that if you're not buying the product,
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040]   you are the product.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.520]   It turns out if you're not paying a lot for the product, you might be the product too.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:37.680]   I don't know if you guys saw it, but how to geek?
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.800]   Did the follow up to their downloads.com or downloads.net?
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.960]   I forget the exact URL where they went and downloaded 10.com.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   It was popular apps.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.960]   It was horrible.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.560]   And two of them have super fish on them.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.160]   So let's just really make this clear.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:57.360]   When you download something from the CNET downloads.com site, and we've talked about this before,
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:02.440]   you part of the download of this other company's software, usually free or shareware, is a
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.120]   downloader which wraps around it, which downloads many other things.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.840]   You can say no, but you got to be quick.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.080]   And by the way, who won't see that?
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.000]   Oh, yes, CBS.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.640]   Among other things, it downloads two different items with super fish on it, which means you've
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:24.040]   got that Komodia certificate on there, which means your machine is now compromised.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.440]   And people, you can download bad Mac software.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.440]   You can get Adware on the Mac.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.000]   Like a lot of third party flash downloads sites love to throw Adware on it.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.960]   So you should only get Flash ever from Adobe if you really want it.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.920]   But it's just the perniciousness of the Adware.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.920]   It's appalling.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.920]   Shocking.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920]   Better language.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.920]   Shocking.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.920]   Bring it back to Apple.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.120]   I mean, they do.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:53.760]   I don't like that quote because I think it's kind of glib and it hides the fact that we don't,
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.520]   we're not selling you a $1,500 notebook for $900.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.720]   We are selling you a product at a pretty substantial markup and that's what our business is based
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.720]   on.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.560]   And also the fact that if the entire world builds all of their machines, the way that
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:12.520]   Apple builds theirs, how many people would not have a computer in their houses or how
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.600]   homes are in their school, in their classrooms?
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:19.200]   Because you just can't, you just can't have a world in which the minimum buy in is $900
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.200]   damn dollars for them.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.200]   I agree.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.800]   I wonder though, how much money.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.200]   I'm glad there's just variety out there.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.080]   So, I recommend if you're going to buy a Windows machine, you go to Microsoft Store and you
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.720]   buy a signature PC, which will have none of that stuff on it.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.760]   Microsoft makes sure of that.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.360]   And I just wonder how much Lenovo makes on all the crap where or HP or any of these companies
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.360]   that load up.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   They said not much.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.360]   That was the worst part of the stuff.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360]   Right.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.160]   So if I had to pay $50 more for a computer, it's still not $900.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.320]   Do that, right?
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.320]   Just do that.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.320]   It can get some very decent stuff for $500 or $600.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:55.320]   And for a lot of people that $300 is a, is the difference between someone owning their
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:58.360]   own machine and having to share it with a couple of people.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   Right.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.280]   Like put it on the box to say like, like, cause some people are worried that people will always
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280]   buy the cheapest machine.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.680]   So they have to have the cheapest machine and then they have to figure out some other
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680]   way to make money.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:09.640]   Just make that a point of pride or a point of value on the box so that someone knows
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.760]   that if it's $20, $30, $50 more, this computer ships without ad wear.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.720]   But like whatever you used to do that explain it.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.080]   They all used to have a checkbox that you could say, I will, are you willing to pay a
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.920]   little bit more and not have anything on there and have a clean install of Windows?
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:23.920]   And you could check that.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.920]   And I wish they continue to do that.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.600]   So credit del, I just bought a Dell laptop that does not have much as one piece of trial
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.240]   where McAfee, which is easy to remove.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.560]   That's why I absolutely don't like it when people make fun of Amazon for selling tablets
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.560]   that have ads on them.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.240]   That is absolutely the way they should do it.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:45.000]   They said, if it is, you can shoot you are having, as an extra $30 more important to you
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.920]   than having ads, we will give you the free choice.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.160]   You're the prices of both of them.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.160]   We feel as though the ads are in obtrusive, but that's not, we're not going to force them
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:57.120]   on you nor are we going to afford you to pay $30 that maybe you don't really have up to
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.120]   you.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.120]   We'll have the ads.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.120]   Make them secure.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.120]   Please make them secure.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.380]   We're going to take a break and make, because we want to make some room because Steve Gibson
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:09.120]   is coming up in about 15 minutes and he, of course, is going to cover this.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.000]   I'm sure the super fish issue from a technical point of view, not from a commercial point
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.040]   of view, but from the second point of view of what it was, what it did and what it means.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.880]   Before we go into our break and you guys can get ready with your picks of the week, I do
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.280]   want to mention this is Steve Jobs' 60th birthday today, Tim Cook.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.720]   Remembering Steve on Twitter, who would have turned 60 today, the only way to do great
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:35.760]   work is to love what you do in a really good picture of Steve.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:43.760]   60 years old today, it's so sad that he was not here to celebrate that birthday.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.960]   Guys get your picks ready.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.720]   That's a word from legalzoom.com, LegalZoom not a law firm.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.040]   They can't connect you with an independent attorney, but I think they're better than
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:58.240]   a law firm because LegalZoom helps you get your life organized at legalzoom.com, whether
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.760]   it's protecting your family with a will or living trust or take control of your family's
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760]   future.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.920]   LegalZoom can help.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.760]   There's no easier way to make sure your family's legally taken care of, whether it's taking
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:14.880]   control of your financial affairs, whether you're starting a business or you have one
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.360]   already, LegalZoom can help you form your business and provide the support you need
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.360]   to run it successfully.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:23.360]   I mentioned before we had Ron Wayne on triangulation about a month ago, he was one of the folks
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.360]   who helped found Apple with Jobs and Wozniak, but he bowed out very quickly because he
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.840]   realized Apple was unincorporated.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.240]   It was just a company and that meant he is the only guy who had any real assets, was
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.760]   libel.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.720]   If they'd only had LegalZoom way back when, they do now for 10 years.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.920]   In fact, I used LegalZoom to protect us within LLC.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.360]   It's helped millions of people get the personalized attention they need.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:55.280]   If you need LegalZoom to protect us within LLC, it's helped millions of people get the
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.280]   personalized attention they need.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.280]   If you need LegalZoom to protect us within LLC, it's helped millions of people get the
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.280]   personalized attention they need.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280]   If you need LegalZoom to protect us within LLC, it's helped millions of people get the
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.280]   personalized attention they need.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.280]   If you need LegalZoom to protect us within LLC, it's helped millions of people get the
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.280]   personalized attention they need.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280]   If you need LegalZoom to protect us within LLC, it's helped millions of people get the
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.280]   personalized attention they need.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280]   If you need LegalZoom to protect us within LLC, it's helped millions of people get the
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.280]   personalized attention they need.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:32.240]   I tell you, there is no reason not to use LegalZoom.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:40.480]   You can let them know you heard about it on MacBreak Weekly.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:38:04.000]   Learn Family is going to be on tomorrow.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:14.000]   We're happy to provide the equipment.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.480]   That just means they give them in-kind equipment.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:26.240]   I've been on a lot of productions actually that have gotten the support from Apple.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.240]   They don't pay for it.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:33.800]   In fact, generally, it seems like they're fielding hundreds of these requests a week.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.600]   People think of a crazy thing because they know that they'll get a lot of promotion by
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.000]   doing something crazy like this.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   They call Apple.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.240]   What you do is you call Apple.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:49.200]   Can I have a couple laptops and a Mac Pro and this is what we want to do.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.840]   It's an arduous process to do that with Apple.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.840]   It used to be very easy.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:57.120]   When Steve Jobs came back in, it closed down pretty quickly.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.320]   It used to be a very freewheel-ending system that is no longer that way.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.800]   I don't believe that Apple paid anything, but I'm sure that someone, and I don't think
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.360]   they approached them with the idea.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.720]   I think that they came up with the idea and they came to Apple and said, "We need a bunch
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.000]   of extra equipment to do that."
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.560]   Apple learned to do them.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.160]   There's some interesting behind the scenes stuff.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.440]   Steve Levitan, who created Modern Family, says he got the inspiration because he has
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.000]   two kids in college and they do a lot of face timing.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.520]   He was working one day with a number of emails and websites, opened up his machine, video
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.360]   chat from his daughter, popped up.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.680]   He saw everything and his wife doing something behind him.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:35.340]   He says, "I realize on that screen you could tell so much about my life.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.960]   Just if you all you saw was a screen."
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.920]   John Brown was involved in this.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.760]   You know John Brown, don't you, Alex?
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.080]   I don't know if I can do that.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.320]   Motion Graphics guy, very well-known name.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:52.920]   Levitan went to John Brown and shot the, they pre-vised it with crew members as a proof
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.080]   of concept.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:01.000]   Brown put the footage together into a mock-up of Claire's computer screen and they had
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.680]   their, they had their storyboards.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.880]   They were a little worried given the resolution of the, the image would lose clarity when they
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.720]   pushed in on elements.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:18.680]   So instead Brown duplicated and animated, get this, the entire Mac interface manually
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.440]   at four times the resolution so they could push the camera in.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:32.640]   So you're not actually looking at a Mac froze screen, you're looking at a simulated screen.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.640]   Brown said he worked on the assets for Yosemite when Yosemite was in beta.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.560]   And so he had to, they actually shot it before Yosemite came out.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.000]   So apparently they had to tweak and swap things around.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.800]   I mean John's here at QSA.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:52.160]   Yeah, John's here at QSA had to do that for his screenshots, right?
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:55.120]   Brown said it was frustrating to be like, act one totally locked and then come back Monday
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.480]   and hear the FaceTime notification and change.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.600]   So they really, they put some effort into making this look like Yosemite.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.840]   Which is funny because a lot of people wouldn't have noticed.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.520]   I mean, it wouldn't have been a big deal for that.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.560]   So that just shows you there's a lot of attention to detail.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.160]   So many horrible iPhone interfaces on TV.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.200]   Like you just like get a text message and it's thing pops up and it's completely alien.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.360]   Well, we'll watch tomorrow.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:18.280]   I think that, that's something to look at is how closely did they really, since you
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.280]   now know it's not a Mac Pro, it's a simulator Mac Pro.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:28.200]   Remember that video from the iPhone 4 when they introduced FaceTime and Scott was just
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.040]   saying, I like to look into my kids eyes and see how are you doing?
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.040]   It was just so intense.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.680]   And I picture that being on the modern family screen.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.600]   You will notice one thing and this comes from a great article on the Verge by Brian Bishop.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.920]   He says, one thing will stand out at you.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.080]   FaceTime, they wanted to have multiple video chats at the same time on the screen, which
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.040]   FaceTime can't do.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.040]   But they had that going.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.040]   So you'll notice that.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.920]   You may say to myself, oh, I didn't know you could do that, well, you can't.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:05.120]   And apparently Brown did not aesthetically like the heavy use of translucency in Yosemite.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.840]   That was such a thorn in my side.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   Everything is transparent.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.000]   When the message scrolls up, you can sort of see it through the top of message.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.600]   So especially if you're rebuilding the interface, that becomes a big deal.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:22.720]   I've had to do quite a few projects where we rebuild and reanimate interfaces.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:28.760]   And the simplest things that you think that you just do while you're in the interface,
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.560]   animating that is an entirely different world.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.480]   Well, he picked the easy solution.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.800]   He just said, Claire, the mom in the show, is kind of a neat Nick.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.080]   I think you know that if you watch the show.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:43.280]   So she's turned off translucency in the settings.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.320]   She went to daring fireball.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.320]   Is it terminal command?
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.320]   You have to do it.
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:49.320]   It's not in the control panel.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.120]   No, I think you put on an accessibility settings.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   Ah, it's accessibility.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.120]   All right.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.600]   Well, you can see there's no translucency here.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:58.640]   It's actually marked something like tone it down.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   Tone it down.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.600]   Give me a break.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.000]   It's actually called give me a break with a translucency.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.320]   Enough with the print enough with the translucency.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.520]   It's a little picture Paul Reiser going, I'm trying to do playback here.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.520]   Please.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.280]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:23.960]   So, I do a lot of walkthroughs for locations, so location scouting.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.120]   And one of the things that we do is we build 3D models of almost every place that we work.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.360]   So we have to figure out where our cameras are going to be.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.840]   And a lot of times we won't have very much time when we get there so we have to block
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.960]   everything out.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.040]   And so one of the things that I need to do is take pictures and then put measurements
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.040]   on.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.960]   So I've got a little laser pointer, which I can make a hardware pick for the thing.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.680]   It's not really a Mac, but Bosch, my little Bosch.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.960]   So I take little laser shots of exactly how high the building is and dimensions.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:55.000]   And I use a program on my iPhone called My Measure Pro.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.480]   My Measures Pro.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.440]   And what it does, there's My Measures and there's My Measures Pro.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.280]   And what you can do is you basically take the photo and then I take measurements and
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.560]   then I just kind of use my finger to kind of create arrows.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.400]   You just kind of pinch your fingers away from each other and you'll create little arrows
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.440]   and then you can just kind of say how big everything is.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.920]   But you have to measure it yourself.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.240]   It doesn't measure it for you.
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.320]   It doesn't measure it for you.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.960]   I have never found that at a professional level, I've never found that the measuring
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:27.960]   for you really works.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:30.800]   They hand those tools, but yeah, they're always a little off.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.240]   Yeah, they're always a little off.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:35.600]   If they're off by a couple inches, sometimes we end up in big problems because we bought
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.120]   railing for it and everything else.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.080]   And so we really want to, I'm happy to do the measurement, but I just needed something
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.960]   quickly so that I can just put in the measurements where they make sense.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.080]   For a long time, I was like drawing on them with my finger and saying 25 feet, no one
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.080]   could read it.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.000]   And so this is a great little app that just kind of does all of those things.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.240]   And I get a series of photos and then I send them out.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.360]   And so it keeps it in folders and you can kind of have sections of this location after
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.160]   this location with those measurements.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.680]   And it's just a great way to, if you're doing that kind of thing, it might be you're planning
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.200]   something for your house or in my case, you're doing location scouting.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.440]   It's a great way to just kind of send it back or keep track of it on top of the photo.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.440]   So that's it.
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.040]   Neat, no.
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.440]   My measure and dimension pro.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.960]   And it's what $3, $4.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.760]   Something like that, a coffee.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:27.760]   What do you see, Jason?
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:28.760]   $89, $89.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:29.760]   All right.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.760]   Two cups of coffee.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.760]   Yeah, big spender.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760]   A really nice cup of coffee.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   Triple brevé venti.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:35.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:39.920]   My kind of coffee.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:41.560]   Renee Richie, pick of the week, sir.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.120]   So I'm piggybacking officer.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.680]   I already called well again, big surprise.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.920]   I only had a chance to play with this a little bit, but she's on a full review already.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:49.480]   And it's called Forge.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:53.480]   It's by the people who make the Adonit Jot Touch styluses, which are the pressure sensitive
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480]   styluses.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.960]   And it's optimized for use with us with those styluses.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:03.280]   And what it is, it's a drawing application, almost like paper by 53, whatever number they
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.280]   are.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.480]   So it's got the same kind of tools, markers and pencils and things like that.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.040]   But what it does is it lets you storyboard as well.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.720]   So those pictures go down into little boxes and you can do very quick, very nuanced iterations.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.200]   I stuck the link for Serenity's thing in the Google Doc as well.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:25.000]   And you can see she's done a whole series of sketches and you can page through all of
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000]   them.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000]   Oh, don't tell me the letter.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.480]   The letter is also a good artist.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.480]   She is a terrific artist.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480]   I hate her.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.480]   She's just too accomplished.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.480]   She's a good at everything.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.480]   She's a good at everything.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.480]   Amazing.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.480]   So it's excellent.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.720]   It works with the stylus.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:45.280]   You can really get a sense of costume design or animation or any sort of iconography.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.320]   I was quickly using it to make different ideas for album art that we're working on.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.640]   And then you can just sort of paste through them.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.400]   You can stick items on the corner and move them between projects.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.320]   You can export as a PNG or a PDF file.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:00.040]   And it's just a really, really great experience.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.040]   It just came out today.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.040]   So it's a version one.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.280]   So it is limited.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.720]   You can't do everything with it yet, but they chose really, really smart things to start
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.720]   off with.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.520]   And as much as I love paper, I like the fact that we're getting this sort of vibrant creative
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.200]   ecosystem on the iPad.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.400]   You know, there's things like Adobe Voice.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.440]   There's all sorts of really great apps.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.240]   And this to me is what sort of unlocks the potential of the iPad is the ability to use
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.280]   it as a much larger canvas for things that would simply be too small on your iPhone to
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   do.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.080]   So it's called forage again via Don it.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.080]   Forage.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.080]   Forage.
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.960]   Thank you for that, pick Mr. Andy Naco.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.480]   Mine is a really cool music app.
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:43.480]   Thanks to Grand Can 3000, the future of video podcasting.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:47.800]   There's so much going on in classical music that you enjoy, like the pretty, pretty music.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.600]   And but then like when somebody who knows what they're talking about could explain what's
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.480]   actually going on with a piece of music, we get something familiar like Beethoven's
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.080]   ninth symphony.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:03.400]   What this app does is it has recordings of four different recordings in four different
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.600]   decades.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.120]   And it will take you through the entire score.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.440]   You can see down here, note for note, showing you these are lighting.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.440]   So here's what sections of the orchestra are actually doing.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.240]   Here's video of the conductor and the orchestra actually playing it.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:22.000]   And there's captions like down here to show you here is what this movement is doing.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.400]   Here's how the composers now setting this section of the orchestra against this other
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.520]   section of the orchestra.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:34.640]   There's just hours and hours and you can switch between like different composers to see how
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.520]   each, excuse me, different conductors to see how each of these conductors has decided
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.800]   to interpret the same text.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.720]   There is also like documentary like interview footage to people explaining the history behind
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.840]   it, the history of Beethoven, like what was going on in his mind at this point in his
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:51.840]   life.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:58.640]   There are a few pieces of classical music that are more well known than the ninth, but you
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:04.920]   just, you have no idea how much is going on here and how this thing was put together.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:10.920]   And I just wound up listening to this piece of music like four times in a row just to just
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.480]   see, oh, well, okay, I'm not going to pretend to understand exactly why Bernstein decided
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.920]   to go that way instead of this other conductor.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.080]   It's not cheap.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.080]   It's a free download and you get about two minutes of this for 1399.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:34.200]   You get all four recordings, all four videos and the entire symphony illustrated this way.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.320]   So it really is pretty exciting.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:41.880]   There's also an iPhone version of it that's certainly not as cool as the iPad version,
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.320]   but it's only 599.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:49.080]   If you do buy the iPhone version that they will let you apply that, I think, towards unlocking
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.640]   the iPad edition too, but just really just supremely entertaining.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:50:00.680]   This is the same publisher that also published, publishes elements, by the way, the periodic
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:02.880]   table of the elements explorer.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.120]   And they really just show you the potential of devices like the iPad.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:13.200]   There's no way to really teach stuff like this as clearly and as compellingly as having
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:16.160]   a fully interactive app like this.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.160]   And of course you can scrub, you can go check out those things.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:25.280]   It's just really, really cool.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.280]   Is that new?
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280]   I think I've seen that before.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.840]   Maybe it's another symphony.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.400]   I think it was a...
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.200]   They have a couple of different educational apps.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.440]   I don't know when this was released.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:36.840]   I think it was released about a year ago.
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:37.840]   Yeah, okay.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:39.840]   I love this.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.280]   I just found it last week and it's like...
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.760]   It's very much like...
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.320]   You see, it's a real thrill to finally recommending something that's more expensive than whatever
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:51.320]   Al has been thinking.
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:52.320]   This is a lot of...
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.240]   This is a $14 for the entertainment.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:51:00.000]   And I'm thinking they do other musical things too, yeah.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.840]   I think they have another musical piece.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.880]   They also have another educational app that walks you through Whisten Churchill's biography
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.640]   and his thought processes.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:09.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:11.880]   Nice stuff.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.880]   Nice stuff.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.280]   We're going to get out of here because we got to get ready for security.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:20.320]   Now a couple of things though, I'll mention.
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.200]   If you use an iPad, and we mentioned this yesterday on iPad today, both Google's inbox
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:28.600]   app, which is their email app, which I love, and Google Play Music now have iPad native
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:29.600]   versions.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:30.600]   Thank you, finally.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.360]   Oh, and YouTube, Kizleo.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:37.340]   And YouTube Kids came out yesterday, which is a kid version of YouTube, limited to just
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:38.600]   videos that are kid-friendly.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.600]   I think that's cool.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:40.600]   Awesome.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.920]   And somebody in the chat pointed out, and I should mention this as well.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.440]   I'm sure we'll talk a little more about it another time.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:55.920]   But Firefox 36 just came out featuring built-in video connections, no download of software.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:58.360]   They're using something called Telefonica.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:05.120]   I know WebRTC is the Chrome Google version of this.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:11.520]   I don't know if you can talk to somebody other than people using Firefox, but that's kind
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.520]   of interesting that this is built-in.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.000]   WebRTC is audio, I think, and WebM or something in video.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.400]   Oh, OK.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.640]   I actually now have a video conference running in the latest Mozilla, and I could just copy
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:29.000]   the link and paste it in, and you can call me, without any additional downloads.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.440]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.880]   Are Firefox and Facebook in a version number arms race?
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.280]   I think so.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:38.360]   I think 36 is, yeah, and updates magically in the background all the time, too.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.760]   Chrome is in 40, so, you know.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.920]   Back in my day, it's for better.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:46.320]   It's using WebRTC.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:47.320]   This uses WebRTC?
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:51.040]   Yeah, it's so that it should be compatible with Chrome.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.440]   It should be, yes.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.440]   That's interesting.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.000]   It just makes it much more, it just makes it much more turnkey.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.720]   Audio or video or both?
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.840]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:09.320]   We are so happy to have you every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1900 UTC.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.320]   That's when we do it live.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:14.240]   Chatroom is so valuable, so please, if you could be here live and in the chatroom, that
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.360]   would be nifty.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:19.680]   But if not, don't worry about it, because we make on demand audio and video available,
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:27.800]   of course, at our website, twitter.tv/mbw, youtube.com/macbreakweekly, and wherever podcasts are aggregated
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.800]   like iTunes.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.960]   And, of course, the apps.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.320]   Here are apps on every platform.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.600]   iOS has Applezone app plus Marcos, a great app.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.960]   There's so many good podcast apps now.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:39.960]   And we're on all of them.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:40.960]   All you have to do is subscribe that way.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:44.440]   You'll get each and every episode or use the great Twit apps.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:48.080]   There's iOS, Android, Roku, Windows, phone apps.
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.600]   We didn't do them all done by great third party developers.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.560]   We thank them for their efforts.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:53.560]   Thank you for being here.
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.200]   Now back to work because break time, it's over.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:06.200]   [MUSIC]
