[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.160]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, AKA the Apple phone
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.920]   shows as we have three of the Apple phone show
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.180]   regulars on the show this week, but couldn't
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.760]   be more fitting since most of the news, really
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.040]   is iPhone news.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.600]   Scott Born from the Apple phone show in the iLife Zone.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700]   Hey, Scott.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.180]   Good day to you, Leo, on his high quality,
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.640]   AT1, whatever.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.040]   Microphone.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.940]   Just the 4040.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.740]   No big 40.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.520]   Did you go to podcast Expo?
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.000]   I did.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.720]   I just got back.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.080]   Oh, good.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.280]   All right.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.040]   I mean, we can get an update from you on that.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.000]   Chris Breen, also the Apple phone show, is here,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.460]   but also known for his Mac 911 column in Macworld magazine.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.500]   And his many books on the iPod and the iPhone.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.380]   Did the iPhone book out soon?
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.260]   It's out now.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.780]   It's now.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.500]   It's your local dealer of iPhone paraphernalia.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.260]   Yay.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.380]   And then you have to rewrite everything?
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.060]   No, because fortunately, I didn't really
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.700]   touch on the whole hacking issue.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.460]   You left that wisely.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.580]   Yes, I think so.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.980]   A wise man.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.780]   Alex Lindsey is here from Pixel Core and PixelCore.com.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.760]   And PixelCore.tv.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.440]   I'll go back from the PME as well.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.960]   And Andy and Oco from the Chicago Sun Times and the CWOB.com.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hey, Andy.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.560]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.400]   I'm sorry that we hear that the phone show
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.720]   have to annex Mac break weekly.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.400]   Unfortunately, we've determined that you're
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000]   incapable of governing yourselves.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640]   We will be instituting a colonial governor
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520]   until such time as peace is restored.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.200]   Thank goodness.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.040]   We expect to be greeted as liberators.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.000]   You are welcome.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.640]   We hail you.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.360]   I give you chewing gum and stockings.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.580]   Oh, no, you're supposed to give me chewing gum and stockings.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.940]   I'm making a mission accomplished sign in this week.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.340]   You're good in that flight suit.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.640]   I think--
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.180]   And just as convincing.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.660]   Steve Jobs might be saying--
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.860]   I'm comparing the final of service attack.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.740]   Steve Jobs might be saying, initially accomplished this week.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.500]   He bricked a few iPhones.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.300]   Let's get a review first of podcast Expo.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.420]   Then we'll get to 111 and then finally the bricking.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.140]   So Chris Breen, were you at PME as well?
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.820]   I was not.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.620]   I was not invited this time.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.380]   I tried to get in, but they locked the doors.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.460]   I wasn't invited, but I could have gone.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.380]   But I just said, I was kind of busy.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.300]   I was up in Vancouver, and then I had to do shows,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.260]   and I had to do the radio show.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.020]   So I just didn't work with Scott now.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.340]   Was it a fun event?
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.220]   It was.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.740]   I had to go because we bought a booth.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.380]   Yeah, Paddango had a booth.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.660]   It was a great booth there.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.700]   I think it was actually the most attended booth as well.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.460]   Really?
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.380]   Wow.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.140]   When you went by the--
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.580]   I think that the big thing that Paddango got right--
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.740]   because I know Scott really can't say this, so I'll say it for him--
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.540]   is that they had a big theater.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.340]   So there was a huge theater, and really had real content.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.780]   I think that was--
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.020]   So people were doing shows in the theater.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.940]   Yeah, people talking about how they get stuff done,
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.620]   and people giving really useful content,
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.980]   rather than just this is what we make kind of thing.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.860]   And I think that by far it was the most successful.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.940]   Sounds like we've made about eight announcements
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.660]   at the show too.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.700]   We bought Gigavox Lite from Doug and--
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.660]   Well, you did.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.140]   Yeah, we did.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.260]   Oh, that's great.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.180]   We got content from Farpoint Media.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.180]   We got the Mommy Cast off a Padd show on to Paddango
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.300]   and all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.740]   Wow, you've been busy.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.460]   We have.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.980]   That's great.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.380]   Well, congratulations.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.220]   It was a good show.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.060]   One thing I noticed is it was--
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.940]   I mean, we've talked about the word plateau,
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.580]   as it refers to podcasting.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.900]   And there were the same pretty much number of people
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.220]   there this year as last.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.620]   It's not like anything.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.460]   It seemed like there might have been a little less.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.140]   Well, there was one less.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.220]   I wasn't there.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.980]   And that might be the reason for the low attendance.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.260]   No, I doubt it very much.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.580]   However, I think that one of the things
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.420]   I noticed about podcast expo last year,
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.740]   and it kind of was one of the reasons
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.140]   I wasn't overly anxious to go, is it's not podcast listeners.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.540]   It's podcast makers who go to that show.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.980]   Well, we're all going to be together in November
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.300]   at a show that might be a little bit better
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.820]   attended called the Blog World and Podcast Expo.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.380]   And it'll be interesting to see the contrast in the two shows.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.220]   Yeah, I'm looking for-- well, Vegas versus Ontario, I don't know.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.220]   Well, and the podcast in portable media expo
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.540]   are podcasts in new media expo.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.580]   They change their name every year.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.100]   I can't remember.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.300]   But Tim and Emile's show will be in Vegas next year's--
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.460]   Well, we'll.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.340]   Yeah, they announced that to couple months.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.860]   I think that's really good.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.900]   And frankly, I'm more likely to go.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.580]   You know, we drove around for hours
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.660]   looking for those strip clubs in Ontario, California.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.580]   Never found them.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.380]   Forget the strip clubs.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.300]   How about a restaurant?
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.580]   I couldn't eat at the Benihana's one more time.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.300]   I mean, that was it.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.380]   Well, sorry.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.940]   Matt was kind enough to drive us all over to Morton's
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.340]   an hour and a half away in Irvine.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.220]   There you go.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.260]   Yeah, well, yeah, the cash fly steak 2.0.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.220]   And it was--
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.180]   We got shirts.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.460]   We got shirts that say steak 2.0.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.900]   Exactly.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.300]   I love it.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.500]   Matt, I mean, the cash fly is a great--
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.060]   boy, he's a great help to this show.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.060]   They do about a terabyte of bandwidth a day for us.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.940]   And I would have gladly eaten his steak.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.620]   I might even have bought him a beer.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.300]   I'd have been there.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.620]   So I'm sorry.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.380]   I'm interested to know what kind of vibe was at the show.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.620]   I went to the very first one.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.060]   And at that point, everybody was trying
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.380]   to learn how to podcast.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.100]   And so there was a lot of swapping of information
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100]   between people.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.060]   How's that different now?
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.700]   I think that there's been an arc that I thought
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.100]   was kind of interesting that occurred for me.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.940]   I was talking to a couple of other people there.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.900]   And one is that the first one, everyone
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.740]   was trying to figure out how to do it three years ago,
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.140]   or two years ago, or whatever.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.260]   Last year, there were a lot of people
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.060]   who were becoming successful.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.420]   And so they had some big, bigger podcasts.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.700]   And they had a lot of listeners.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.820]   And a couple of those celebrities
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.260]   were there, a fair number of the celebrities from the ones,
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.580]   I mean, including Leo and other people were there.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.100]   And it was building into this thing
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.540]   where you could see this thing picking up.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.340]   Now, what it felt like this year was
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.180]   that a lot of the folks that were successful
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.780]   had kind of crossed over into just online media,
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.660]   media production, or they didn't really see themselves
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.420]   in the same zone and didn't really come.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.500]   And so what you ended up having were the people that
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.620]   were kind of in the middle still kind of moving forward.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.060]   And then another round of people coming in
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.660]   that were new and, oh, I want to get into this.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.860]   So it seemed to-- like, they didn't very effectively
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.540]   keep a lot of the way it felt like a lot of the--
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.860]   I mean, there were a handful of people
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.140]   who were really leading the pack.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.020]   But still, it didn't seem like it was as many.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.780]   It seemed like they had kind of crossed over and moved on.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.500]   And so I think that was the hard part for the conferences
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.060]   like this is to kind of keep up and keep those people
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.580]   in the fold.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.060]   And I think part of that comes down to what
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.180]   Leo was posting on his blog last week about the name podcast.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.580]   And how we think about the media.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.660]   You've never really called your stuff podcast.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.780]   It's been-- it's always been shows.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.660]   Yeah, we just think of it as-- we just think of our stuff
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.500]   as shows.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.700]   You know, we do shows that happens to show up on the internet,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.220]   but it could be on TV or radio or whatever it is.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.700]   Podcast--
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.900]   --we feels diminutive, feels somehow like, oh, you're
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.260]   just a podcast.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.020]   Well, Michael Gohegan gave a speech that was interesting.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.340]   He says, you know, I use a hammer.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.700]   That's a tool.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.340]   I use a podcast to tell a story.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.980]   That's a tool.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.780]   He says, I don't call myself a hammer.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.780]   Right.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.780]   Right.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.580]   And what was really interesting, Leo,
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.980]   was basically what my blog post said.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.020]   Well, more importantly, it's exactly what your keynote
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.820]   said a year ago.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.660]   Really?
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.660]   Did I owe you?
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.220]   Everybody was-- everybody was-- remember we had the net casting
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.100]   thing, and you and I talked about net casting?
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.020]   Well, I even feel net casting was a little misguided,
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.340]   because even that is more about how you're doing.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.660]   It's more about the tool than the hammer than the content.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.020]   In any of it, you got some raised eyebrows last year.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.420]   And this year, everybody's mimicking you.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.660]   So there you go.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.580]   Well, and I think there's nothing wrong with calling yourself
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.620]   a podcaster and identifying with that.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.180]   I mean, it's a noble--
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.220]   there's a very noble medium, but it is really just
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.620]   the way we do it.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.740]   The medium is-- and all of our shows
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.860]   are available in a variety of ways, including podcasts,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.940]   but not limited to podcasts.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.700]   Yeah, but it does help people know how to find your show.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.500]   Well, that's the question.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.180]   Does it help people or does it--
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.980]   If I call myself a broadcaster--
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.460]   That's confusing.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.100]   Do people know that, well, I'm from Boston,
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.260]   so gee, I live in here in a tunnel, Iowa.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260]   I don't have a super head or a dying radio.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.620]   I'm not going to be able to tune it in.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.060]   Whereas if I say, well, I've got a podcast,
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.940]   they know to maybe plug my name into a search engine.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.140]   They won't spell it correctly, so they still won't find it.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.780]   But at least I got to distract themselves
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.660]   with a pointless effort.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.460]   Yeah, I mean, it's true that there is no obvious answer to this.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.180]   I think sometimes though, when you say podcast,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.140]   the amount of explanation you have to do behind it--
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.020]   Yeah, this is an deterrent.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.940]   There's always that certain level of sophistication,
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.060]   very bad level of sophistication, that any new medium hits,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.540]   it happened to blogging, it happened to web-site creation,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.820]   when you have people who don't want to do it anymore,
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.140]   because they want to grow long beards and put on wire
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.340]   and classes and pontificate to each other
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.740]   about the meaning of this new medium that they've created.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.260]   Right.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.900]   Have they transgressed?
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.980]   Rather, have they--
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.420]   Crossed over.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.620]   Transferred-- oh, exactly.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.620]   I mean, just podcast.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.860]   Just read more, just put it online,
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.380]   just let people listen to it.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.660]   As we look at the progression of this,
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.980]   it happens in every medium.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.820]   I mean, when you look at my grandfather,
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.540]   picked up the first commercial radio broadcast
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.100]   with a crystal little receiver in 1921 or whatever.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.340]   And he was a ham radio operator and all of that stuff.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.940]   But it was really-- when you think about that,
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.140]   when you think about him describing--
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.180]   I remember when I was little, he would describe all this stuff--
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.580]   it felt almost like podcasting.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.820]   Well, that's actually a perfect analogy,
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.820]   because for all technology, because it used to be that if you
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.340]   had a radio, it's because you're one of these few people
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.020]   who understood the technology and knew how to get the parts.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.100]   And you're basically doing it for the satisfaction
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.660]   of doing something that's new and cool,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.060]   and to learn something.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.380]   Then you had a radio because you had a friend who
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.700]   had those qualifications and can build one for you.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.460]   And as things progress and progress,
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.860]   these people who knew how to do it,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.620]   who invented the technology, who get on the ground floor,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.500]   they start becoming less and less distinct,
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.660]   because now a radio is something you can just do
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.340]   and get a radio check, for God's sake.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.980]   As far as the consumer--
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.820]   But it happened with computers.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.940]   It happened with this body of our other technology.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.180]   We'll be at a point in which, just like there's no such thing
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.580]   as a community of web users or a community of email users,
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.620]   there will no longer be a community of podcasters,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.940]   because it's just something that people can simply do.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.620]   They can simply be on vacation.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.820]   What they're doing is technically podcasting their day,
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.020]   but they're really just sharing their events with their friends
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   and their coworkers.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.140]   When we see the broadcast media coming the other direction,
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.300]   so they're coming more and more towards the web,
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.020]   with somewhere in the middle, you have everybody kind of meeting
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.340]   and that convergence that everyone talked about for a long time,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.420]   looks like it's actually kind of molding together
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   and it'll be uncomfortable.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.540]   Well, actually, that's never really been what the big media does.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.460]   They don't come to podcasting.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.500]   They simply are always in the same business.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.300]   They've always been.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.380]   They just add this new tool to their stable of techniques.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.340]   Just like every really good newspaper now has a web presence
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.580]   that is four times better than the best independent political blog
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.820]   that's out there.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.820]   Not all newspapers are up to that scratch,
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.740]   and that's why some newspapers are going to do really, really well
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.780]   in the next 10 years, and the others are probably going to be bought
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.540]   by the newspapers.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.900]   They're doing really, really well.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.260]   It's kind of like that with podcasting.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.380]   NPR has done so well with podcasting,
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.460]   but I guess it was my point, really.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.060]   They don't see themselves as podcasters.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.740]   It's another way of distributing what they do,
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.460]   which is content.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.460]   Anyway, this isn't the podcast show,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.820]   and I thought it would be fun to get out of it.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.100]   Let me put on my fake beard so I can stroke it.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.860]   I like stroking my beard.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.340]   It's difficult being a respected and beloved
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.660]   as free podcasts to explain these people.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.020]   Well, I come from mainstream media,
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.980]   and I still have my foot in both camps.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.740]   And I have no-- I don't feel as any--
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.500]   I'm not embarrassed to say I'm a podcaster.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.100]   I just think it might be a little confusing,
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.140]   since it's really not--
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.820]   There's a bear that wouldn't be getting paid to be podcasting,
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.100]   that's all.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.900]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.060]   So-- Off mic.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.700]   So what I want is a review.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.700]   And Chris Breen, I'd like you to start it off of iPhone Update 111.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.380]   Leaving aside the bricking issue, what's new in this update?
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.540]   And is it worth doing if you're an iPhone owner?
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.580]   Well, you know, I wish I could tell you from experience,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.580]   but I haven't updated my iPhone.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.580]   Interesting. Why not?
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.060]   Because I like my iPhone the way it is.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.220]   I have a lotta with the app tap.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.940]   Yeah, that's what I--
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.220]   Yeah, with app tap, because I'd like to instant message
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.020]   from my iPhone.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.820]   I like to have a dictionary on my iPhone.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.620]   I like to play games on my iPhone.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.460]   I like to do lots of things on my iPhone.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.660]   I can tell you what's in the update, though.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.580]   And maybe, wait a minute.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.180]   Let's ask somebody who has obviously a virgin iPhone,
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.940]   because Scott Bourne doesn't believe in selling his iPhone
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.260]   in any way with anything that Steve Jobs is not fully blessed.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.060]   How do you like 111?
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.300]   Hey, Scott, wait.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.620]   I think that if Leo works at it, he can come up with an even
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.620]   bitchier version of that question.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.700]   What would you say, Andy?
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.780]   How can I make that worse?
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.620]   Scott, you're an idiot.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.060]   We all know that.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.580]   No, no, no.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.820]   You're not at the great bosom of Steve Jobs.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.060]   And when he calls the tune, you start dancing.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.460]   We would like to have the opinion of a complete Paul
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.660]   Trune on this issue.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.260]   How about this?
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.180]   You have 80 seconds to go.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.620]   Scott, would you remove your mouth from Steve Jobs'
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.980]   teat for a moment and let us know how you like 111?
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.300]   You know, I come on this show regularly just for this kind
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.460]   of a bit.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.020]   People think, first of all, we love Scott Bourne.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.260]   We are speaking in the tone of Leo.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.900]   Yeah, he was doing my--
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.300]   We all love Scott Bourne.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.380]   Nobody's mad at Scott Bourne.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.020]   Everybody thinks he's the greatest guy in the world.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.460]   By the way, 25 people stopped me at the podcast.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.900]   I said, are you in Leo, OK?
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.340]   I know.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.260]   And I had to actually post and stuff.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.460]   Of course, I love Scott.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.900]   And we have a fun, I think, talking back and forth on this.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.940]   We all agreed this would be the most boring show in the world.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.740]   Well, let me just-- let me reverse this.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.780]   I'll tell you exactly what's in the update quickly after this.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.660]   I do not approve of the way this has resulted in ripped phones
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.100]   because it does not appear that there's a path back
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.060]   into the fold.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.020]   I'd like it on record that I'm about to say the following words.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.540]   I believe that Apple and/or AT&T have made a huge mistake.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.020]   I think we probably are all in agreement, although that's not
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.700]   universal.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.780]   I got a lot of heat for saying Apple made a mistake.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.420]   But I will get to that.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.740]   Yeah, the mistake is that from a shareholders point of view,
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.740]   it looks like it cuts off a revenue opportunity, which
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.220]   does not make Scott happy.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.220]   But let's go back and talk about what's in the update.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.740]   You got the iTunes Wi-Fi music store, which does work.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.260]   I've used it for--
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:05.620]   Show of hands.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.900]   Everybody excited about that?
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.620]   Yes.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.620]   Yes.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.060]   I'd like to give him more opportunities
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.460]   to spend more money on American.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   Is it a great way to buy iTunes?
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.220]   It was very quick and easy.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.420]   I liked it a lot.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.900]   They say there's improved security.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.100]   No way to test that today.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.860]   They say there were 10 security patches, which
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.900]   is a lot.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.340]   I do believe the speakerphone and receiver volume
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:27.860]   are louder.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.380]   They claim it.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.580]   And I believe it.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.380]   For the people who come from a BlackPairy,
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.140]   you got your double tap shortcut.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.100]   I do like that.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.220]   And I signed mine.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.620]   You have a couple of--
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.340]   I think three choices.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.140]   You can make it double tap.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.220]   Still be home.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.300]   You can have it go to your favorites in your phone
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.700]   application so you can quickly dial or go to the iPod.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.700]   And that's what I did.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.860]   For me, it's an iPod, as much as anything.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.340]   So what did you do with your double tap?
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.620]   I'm using it to go to the iPod as well.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.620]   And you can now turn off edge.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.540]   So those $14,000 bills for your drift Africa are all over.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.460]   Thank you.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.580]   You can change the SMS MESD alert sound, which
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.260]   is a big deal, I guess, to some people.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.540]   But I'm happy with the triathlon.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.300]   You could only turn it on or off in the past tonight
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.300]   and give it a sound.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.140]   And you can finally get mail attachments
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.980]   in both portrait and landscape mode, which
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.140]   is a step in the right direction.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.540]   But why the heck can we just get everything in landscape
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.140]   modes, my question?
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.860]   But yeah, there's some cool stuff.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.660]   And I updated.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.660]   I had no problems.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.380]   It worked in eight minutes, no issues whatsoever.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.060]   I can say, I don't understand the business case, nor can anyone
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.500]   make for me the business case for saying, well,
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.700]   now that you've bricked your phone,
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.060]   we don't want your $60 a month.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.140]   Just make them--
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.020]   that was always my attitude was--
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.940]   I think it's even a moral business side.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.540]   I think it's immoral to brick people's phones
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.340]   just because you don't like what they did with it.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.860]   You should do.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.060]   And what you have the right to do is make it take off those apps.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.900]   I think that's a mistake.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.180]   But you could take off those apps.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.340]   And if they unlocked it, just say, sorry,
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.620]   you've got to put your AT&T SIM back in and activate.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.100]   You can't use it without AT&T?
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.580]   That seems like a reasonable thing.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.460]   Do you think their way maybe was a technical reason they
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.620]   couldn't do that?
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.100]   That's what I want to know.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.940]   Is there a reason why you can't make it so they can roll back?
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.900]   Because we took some phones for some friends to AT&T store,
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.580]   and they did their very best.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.500]   They couldn't--
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.060]   now I've heard anecdotal evidence that some geniuses are
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:19.820]   able to--
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.340]   They are.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.900]   They're actually rolling it back now.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.860]   So they've got the hackers up on the wiki
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.100]   have come up with steps so that you can roll it back to 1.0.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.900]   Has anybody tried that?
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.540]   How well does that work?
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.220]   My understanding is it's working pretty well.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.940]   We've bricked one at Macworld because we had to to see how it
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.780]   worked.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.020]   And they're working on it in the lab now to bring it back.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.500]   It depends on how you bricked it.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.100]   If you use the free method, you can get Wi-Fi back,
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.140]   but you can't get the phone back.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.100]   You'll never get it activated as a phone.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.140]   And this is because you're flashing the firmware
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.780]   on the modem in unlocking.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.780]   And there's no reverse flash.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.500]   Not yet.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.220]   But I could do that, though.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.460]   Oh, of course they could.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.740]   And the thing is, is that--
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.020]   That must be what the geniuses do.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.100]   I imagine the geniuses just reflash everything.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.740]   But do we know that that's the case?
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.380]   We don't know what they're doing now.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.380]   When I--
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.380]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.100]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.100]   All I was going to say is that I really think that we
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.900]   assume--
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.580]   When guys were sitting there with Saturn irons fixing it,
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.020]   we looked at that like that was crazy.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.820]   I mean, I looked at it.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.020]   That's clearly a one-way street.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.220]   I was like, you start opening a beside a Saturn
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.940]   iron on your own.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.020]   But I think there's a certain assumption, at least that I
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.500]   have, at least on my Mac, that I'm going to be able to--
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.940]   if I can do anything with software, eventually I can fix it.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.300]   The idea that I could do something with software
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.340]   and then not be able to use my phone again
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.740]   is I think it's reprehensible.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.460]   I think that 1.1 is the biggest mistake Apple's made
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.900]   in a decade.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.620]   Andy, what were you going to say?
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.380]   All I was going to say is that there are limits to how
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.620]   strongly I can react to this right now, only because I
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.420]   feel as though I need to collect a lot more information.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.100]   If there was--
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.540]   What would you like to know?
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.580]   If at some point, Apple put on a whiteboard, you know--
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.900]   we must brick all these phones.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.500]   We must punish people for having unlocked their phones--
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.180]   some unlocked their phones.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.100]   That is reprehensible.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.620]   There is no defense for that.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.540]   And it doesn't make any sense, even from a business
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.300]   standpoint.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.260]   However, if the point is that this unlocking software
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.900]   is doing things that are not just simply inconvenient for Apple,
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.900]   but a huge maintenance nightmare where--
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.020]   I mean, if someone has moved into a house
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.420]   and replaced all the structural pillars in the house
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.100]   with corrugated styrofoam, and someone says, oh, by the way,
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.420]   we really-- that was a bad mistake.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.300]   We want you to replace these things back.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.740]   And then the question is going to be, well, how do we do that?
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.060]   Because you've just essentially cheesed all the built-in code
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.460]   that we have in that device that's
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.500]   purpose-built for replacing the ROM.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.460]   There might be instances in which it's easy to do,
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.140]   in which case Apple--
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.900]   I think they could reflect.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.940]   Again, that's the difficulty that I have with a lot of the reaction.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.180]   People are saying, oh, I think they could do it if they wanted to.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.020]   Well, we don't know what you can or can't do.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.140]   I think we've really been given the flag that they're getting for this.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.660]   It would really be in their best interest
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.020]   to send out one engineer to give one interview
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.180]   to one influential person-- not even saying me--
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.700]   just to simply explain, here's how these things work.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.660]   Here's what we're dealing with here at the lab.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.820]   We are very, very sure that we can't come up with a simple solution
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.740]   or even a--
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.020]   Here's the reasonably complicated solution
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.780]   that we can distribute to our genius people to fix your phone.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.940]   Here's the risk.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.020]   The only thing we could do is--
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   Exactly.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.860]   They don't think we could do it.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:27.380]   They don't think we could do it.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.740]   They could basically swap you out with a brand new phone.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.980]   And we're not sure we want to do that for 10,000 people.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.860]   And by the way, nobody knows if that's what the geniuses are doing.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.740]   They may be swapping a new phone.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.580]   But here's the risk.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.820]   If Apple steps forward and says that--
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.220]   and even if they believe it and they've proven wrong,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.740]   then they really come up with egg in their face.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.420]   Well, I think they have now at this point anyway.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.180]   I mean, they issued this warning, supposedly, saying,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.100]   this could happen.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.180]   Well, obviously, they knew it was going to happen.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.180]   I can't believe an entire--
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.940]   They tested it.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.940]   They found out it happened.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.140]   Yeah, they found out it would.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.540]   But I think to cover their ass, they didn't say, it will do this.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.260]   They said it may do this.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.380]   And I'm not sure why people did it unless they had to.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.620]   And then they found themselves in an uncomfortable situation.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.620]   However, if you look at the way the previous updates worked,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.700]   you would watch the progress of the thing in iTunes.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.900]   It would check your firmware.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.740]   If it saw that the firmware was untouched,
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.820]   it would update the phone.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.100]   If it saw that the firmware had been
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.300]   mucked with in some way, it went back and completely
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.460]   overrode the firmware.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.740]   So why not put a step in this process somewhere
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.140]   for unlocked phones that says, I'm sorry,
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.700]   I can't upgrade your phone.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.540]   I'm going to leave you at 102, and that's it.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.620]   They could have done that.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.180]   They clearly could have done that.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.620]   Yeah, and why not?
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.020]   I mean, it does seem to be--
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.980]   How do you respond to that?
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.820]   How do you respond to that, Andy?
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.820]   I mean, that's true.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.700]   You can't deny that.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.020]   If that is true, then, yeah, they're
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.020]   now in a position of having to explain why they didn't--
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.380]   They just do a check sum on the firmware and the modem.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.780]   They say, oh, boy, this is hacked.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.580]   And say, step away from it.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.500]   Say, we're not going to support you.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.740]   We're not going to update you.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.460]   We don't want to see you ever again,
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.220]   because you've messed with you.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.500]   I have to admit that in this sort of a place,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.140]   I'm responding not as a tech guy, but as a humanist.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.620]   I find it really, really difficult for most companies,
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.100]   including Apple, to simply say, we have a decision A,
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.780]   we do something that doesn't destroy someone's telephone
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.980]   they paid $500, $600 for, or decision B,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.660]   we arbitrarily decide that just as a punitive gesture,
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.740]   we're going to wreck this phone.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.140]   I don't believe that most companies-- more than that,
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.700]   most people who work for most of these companies--
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.940]   would say that no-- we definitely
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.940]   want to destroy a $500 phone.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.700]   I can see Steve Jobs doing that.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.020]   I can see Steve Jobs doing that.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.260]   I think he's very arrogant, and he's very--
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.260]   what do you think, Alex Lindsay?
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.140]   You probably know him as well as him.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.140]   I don't know.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.740]   I don't know him at all.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.580]   I know him, and I think he would do that.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.940]   But another thing is that I would say that I don't think
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.660]   that they've vindictively went after anything,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.740]   but I do think that it was very, very poorly thought of.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.740]   They could have handled it better.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.660]   I mean, they're now looking at a class action suit,
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.940]   which I think might have teeth.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.940]   They've taken people who jumped on early, a lot of them,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.940]   not all of them, but a lot of them jumped on early
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.940]   and paid $200 extra, and then they brick their phones.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.660]   And the people that they brick the phones of,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.220]   or the people that were probably the most excited
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.340]   about the phones.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.660]   And so the thing is, they've taken people who--
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.820]   what we've learned from this process now is,
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.220]   A, don't buy anything that Apple does immediately,
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.340]   because you don't know what's going to happen next.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.900]   Don't update it.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.460]   And for gosh's sake, don't play with it.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.980]   Here's what's so un-apple, and it's
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.220]   so like Verizon, AT&T, the RIA, and Microsoft.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.900]   I want to point out that we said when we talked about this phone
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.380]   for months beforehand, and Scott was one of them,
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.060]   this is something-- in fact, I even said,
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.380]   I can't believe Apple is going to do this,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.580]   because once you start getting in bed with cell phone
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.660]   companies, this is the path you start down.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.780]   I'm sure the 18-- this is a requirement from AT&T's point.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.700]   Yeah, and I just want to point out that Andy's making
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.460]   a good point that's probably going to get lost on a lot of people.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.940]   We don't know what we know.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.180]   We got a lot of surmising and giving going.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.180]   But yeah, but what about Chris's point?
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.460]   I mean, it could be AT&T that's done this for all we know.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.540]   But Chris's point is good.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.820]   It's because they send in the network handshake that
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.620]   causes the brick.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.220]   No, but Chris's point is absolutely valid,
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.700]   which is they could have looked at the phone and said,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.380]   this is going to brick it, we won't give you the update.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.780]   There's no technical reason they could have done that.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.940]   That's true.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.100]   And like I said, unless there's a contractual reason they
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.380]   couldn't.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.460]   But I suspect AT&T certainly put some pressure on them
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.220]   to do something, maybe not brick it.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.780]   If it was AT&T's interest that you force them to use the AT&T
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.740]   SIM.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.580]   Well, the thing is it doesn't help AT&T because now if I
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.660]   have a brick phone, maybe that you can't force them to use
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.620]   an AT&T SIM, though.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.820]   I think once you flash that--
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.260]   I mean, maybe you can't go back.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.100]   I don't know.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.780]   Well, the two things we don't know, we think we know.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.260]   But the two things we don't know are how intentional this was
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.460]   and exactly which company is behind it.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.340]   Now, we have lots of ideas.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.980]   I'm calling on both companies to step forward and say, OK,
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.260]   here's how you can get amnesty.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.220]   Here's what you can do.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.140]   There's simply no business case for it.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.780]   And as you guys have concluded, there's no humanist case
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.500]   as well.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.660]   I'm more interested in the business case.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.420]   I mean, I'm not particularly sad for people that
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.020]   hacked the phone.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.380]   You guys know my position on that.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.580]   But I do think it's silly to say, we
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.260]   don't want your $60 a month.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.020]   I have just no idea in my mind who made that decision.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.420]   And if Steve is that playing that kind of hard ball--
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.340]   and they did this--
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.340]   if you've got a long memory, like I do,
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.180]   you go back to the Apple II when some of the first schools
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.740]   started pirating software and you saw the campaign
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.860]   he launched against him.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.180]   He's played hard ball before.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.860]   And if he's doing it now, I do think it's a mistake.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.140]   He is human.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.020]   He can make mistakes.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:52.940]   And I think it's a mistake.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.660]   And I think they'll correct it.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.300]   This is something Sony has done, by the way, with a PSP.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.980]   They've tried to brick PSPs.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.220]   And I think that this beyond the whole AT&T thing,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.020]   I think that not provide an SDK was fine.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.180]   But as people really started developing a lot of software
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.220]   and having a lot of fun with it, and Apple not really
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.660]   saying anything, in fact, it was one of those things where
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.620]   it seemed like Apple was looking the other way.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.460]   Josh said he thought it was a good idea.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.900]   He said it was OK with him.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.820]   And not only did it seem like it was OK,
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.980]   they have a history of it with the Apple TV
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.260]   of letting people just run a muck with it.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.660]   Yeah, they don't have any partners with it.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.220]   We're not going to have any of it on the path.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.380]   They have any partners with the Apple TV either, though.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.340]   And look at the success of the Apple TV.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.380]   Maybe that's going to save.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.860]   Oh, I don't think you could say it's less successful
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.740]   because it's more hackable.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.780]   I don't know.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.420]   But I think that there was a lot of--
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.100]   people were having a lot of fun with it.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.100]   And I think that now the problem is, I haven't updated either
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.540]   and don't have any intention of updating anytime soon.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.500]   There's nothing on it that's new that I particularly
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.700]   feel like I need.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.660]   And the only thing I changed about it is my ringtones.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.100]   Let's set aside the unlock for a moment
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.580]   and just talk about what Apple did for third party apps.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.940]   They didn't delete them oddly enough.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.740]   They just made them invisible.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.460]   So you're saying, Alex, even that's going too far?
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.500]   Well, no, I don't think that there's any need to do that.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.460]   I mean, maybe there is.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.740]   Maybe there's some kind of security thing
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.300]   and they've decided they're going to close it off.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.580]   I think that the PR problem with what they did--
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.820]   and they're not going to-- I don't think
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.820]   they're going to go back or anything.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.980]   But the PR problem with what they did
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.980]   is when we first got the phones, we didn't expect
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.380]   that we were going to be able to do very much.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.220]   We talked about it here.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.500]   I didn't expect that we were going
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.980]   to see that many applications.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.500]   No, neither did I.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.820]   But then Apple didn't really do anything.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   And for months, people started developing stuff.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.180]   And they started feeling like they had tacit approval
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.060]   just to keep on going.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.860]   And you had people putting energy into it.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.700]   And people really enjoying great new little applications
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.980]   that they could play with.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.380]   And then on all of a sudden, it's just boom, it's gone.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.020]   And I think it's just a communication issue.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.980]   And we know that Apple doesn't communicate very often.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.780]   But I think that it's just a PR nightmare
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.660]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.460]   I mean, it's just poorly managed.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.060]   And I do also think that we're seeing
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.380]   why our existence as Mac users has been so nice in a kind
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.900]   of a warm atmosphere of we control everything.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.660]   As soon as we have to be outside of that system,
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.820]   Apple dealing with AT&T, I think that now we're seeing
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.060]   the challenges, most likely, that Microsoft has had, you know,
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.140]   since its beginnings.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.220]   Why hasn't there been more bad press about this?
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.460]   It's a small number of people.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.740]   I keep telling you guys.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.100]   It has not been--
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.780]   I was being driven to--
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.460]   was driven from the airport on Friday,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.740]   Friday early afternoon.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.060]   And we were listening to NPR in the car.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.860]   And it was a story on NPR.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.540]   When was the last time you had a Windows Mobile smartphone
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.900]   story on NPR?
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.260]   It was like--
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.100]   Were they critical of Apple?
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.620]   Yeah, they were saying-- well, it was a news item,
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.060]   so they couldn't personally be critical.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.420]   But they were reporting that the new update has caused
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.780]   a lot of phones not to work, a lot of added features
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.900]   that have been added on by users not to work.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.220]   And they were also reporting that it was resulting in a lot
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.820]   of bad blood for Apple online.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.820]   All right.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.900]   And you know, where else is--
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.660]   I'm surprised because I've even-- you know,
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.700]   I've gotten a lot of heat.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.980]   At least 50% of the responses to my blog post, which
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.420]   got over 100 responses, were oh, stop whining.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   And I'm not whining.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.580]   In fact, I don't have a brick phone.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:20.300]   But I just think it's over the top of our behavior on Apple.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.380]   I think where the real PR problem is here
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.260]   is that, yes, it's a small number of people
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.380]   who have this problem.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.860]   However, the people that did do it
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.020]   are the people that waited in line for two days.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.420]   And people like us who are geeks and people who have a voice.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.220]   So yes, it's a small number of people that are affected.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.940]   However, we're the noisy ones.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.620]   You know, I mean, this whole show is about this.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.300]   I was on KGO last night.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.380]   And I was talking about it there.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.540]   And I'm talking about it in my blogs.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.020]   And everybody I know who has that kind of phone
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.180]   is doing the same thing, whether their phone was
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:50.780]   brick or not.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.100]   I went out and I went out in the library.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.020]   I had a Raspberry 82.30 for my AT&T account,
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.380]   because frankly, I want a phone I can add third party apps to.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.420]   And I don't feel comfortable now adding third party apps
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.900]   to my good phone, my real phone.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.700]   And I have to say that for the first time
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.820]   in a very long time, as far as-- and maybe the first time
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.060]   since I can remember, I found myself
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.340]   cringing at what Apple's going to do next.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.860]   It was kind of like--
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.300]   You know, America's going to do it.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.540]   I don't normally have that relationship.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.300]   My relationship with Apple is mostly--
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.020]   Steve tells me what I'm buying tomorrow at a big event.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.140]   And I just go out and buy it.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.300]   It just look around this table.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.500]   I mean, now Andy's a journalist.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.140]   Chris is a journalist.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.780]   But Scott, you and I are fans.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.140]   And we do.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.660]   We just buy the next thing that comes out from Apple.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.620]   I just want to--
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.660]   I've ordered the next three things I don't see.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.300]   Go out and kill Mr. Jobs.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.260]   We shall kill.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.260]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.020]   We like our--
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.540]   And I think that what this really affects--
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.420]   or it could affect if Apple's not careful,
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.220]   is the quote unquote distortion field that Steve has.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.420]   You know that we're going to kind of-- well, we're going
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   to look and see how well this actually turns out.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.500]   And it means that you don't have the instant reaction.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.380]   You don't have the lines outside the Apple store.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.780]   You don't have-- that's the kind of stuff
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.660]   that you give up if this goes down too far.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.700]   Well, do you mind if I lay out my nightmare scenario of where
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.540]   I think this is going?
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.020]   Yes.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.620]   Please do.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:03.980]   We don't.
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.540]   All right.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.700]   Well, this is based on what they're doing with the iPods now.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.540]   These current iPods now do not support video out,
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.700]   except for devices that hold a special Apple authorization
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.380]   chip.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.100]   So it's a double tax.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.020]   So let's suppose that the one reason they wiped out
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.180]   these third-party apps is because Apple is indeed
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.980]   going to be selling third-party applications,
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.060]   but they're only going to do it through the iTunes store.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.980]   That's the only method of delivery.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.380]   So if you want to develop third-party apps, yes,
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.740]   Apple will give you an SDK.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.900]   However, they have to be routed through the iTunes store.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.180]   And when they are, Apple's going to take 10%
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.860]   as they do with a made-for iPod program for every application
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.220]   that goes through iTunes.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.300]   And with successive updates, they
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.740]   will make sure that they wipe out any third-party app that
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.300]   is not tagged with some kind of iTunes stamp of approval.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.820]   And that concerns me because I've seen them do it with the iPod
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.620]   and I'm afraid they're going to do it with the iPhone.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.500]   As far as applications go, to be blunt,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.140]   I actually don't have any problem with that
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.020]   as long as they make an SDK and let people actually develop.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.780]   If what you have to do is go through that process,
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.940]   doesn't bother me nearly as much.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.460]   I think that's so bad.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.380]   That's certifying.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.180]   I don't think that says much of a nightmare.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.620]   Also, not that I think that less diversity
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.100]   is an advantage for users, but in defense
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.180]   of some sort of a tagging system,
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.940]   I've tried to find applications for my Windows Mobile devices.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.380]   I've tried to find applications for my Palm devices.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.380]   And I will not find quality stuff that really works the way
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.340]   it's advertised.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.180]   And there's so little free software for those platforms
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.780]   anyway.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.820]   I go to Handango.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.780]   In a way, it's already defactoed that way for most handheld
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.020]   users.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.420]   They go to Handango.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.620]   Handango handles the whole transaction.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.020]   They take their cut.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.020]   Yeah, but in this case, Apple could very clearly define
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.780]   what is and what is not acceptable.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.980]   So for example, instant messaging.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.820]   No, because they want to do SMS.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.820]   They want to force people to SMS.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.420]   And so if they are the one-- if they're the arbiters of what
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.580]   we can and can't have, that's a problem.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.260]   By the way, just an update from my--
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.700]   I think I talked about using my phone.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.940]   I didn't know how much it had cost me in Zimbabwe.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.420]   $153.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.540]   That's not awful.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.460]   I mean, it's not 10,000.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.580]   50 cents in SMS.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.460]   So I did 75 SMS and that's not bad.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:09.940]   That's what I paid.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.220]   So it wasn't that bad.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.180]   So anyway, sorry.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.580]   There is one larger thing, though.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.140]   But I'm sorry.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.820]   I just remembered something that I had an idea at loss.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.620]   I think I'm back again.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.940]   And now before it runs away from me again,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.300]   Apple has to make a conscious choice over whether the iPhone
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.540]   is a cellular telephone or whether it's a new computing
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   platform.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.700]   If they want it, they can choose to make it a cellular
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.740]   telephone, by which case they can control the firmware.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.100]   They can control third-party apps.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.740]   They can control everything they want.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.460]   But if they want it to truly be a computing platform,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.860]   they do have to open it up.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.220]   They do have to be happy with lots of clever, clever,
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.980]   and industrial people doing things to and with this device
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.100]   that they didn't intend.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.420]   And in that way, making it a bigger and better and broader
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.060]   device.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.780]   Well, I think that's what's happened here,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.500]   is that people who have acted have seen it as a computer.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.820]   And AT&T is saying, no, it's a cell phone.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.500]   Well, but I think a lot of us are very--
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.380]   I mean, a lot of us are excited about having other applications.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.460]   If Apple built an aggressive, user-friendly software
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.020]   development kit, and let people do it,
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.380]   and even if it has to be blessed by Apple
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.500]   and go through the iTunes store, we get lots of people
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.260]   developing cool ideas and going through that process.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.100]   And at least as a start, I think that would make a big
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.540]   difference.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.020]   It's just that Apple does not--
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.460]   this is in other cases, Apple does not have a history of
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.700]   dealing with their software developers particularly well,
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.140]   nearly as well as Microsoft.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:29.940]   Erica from--
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.700]   Sedun, who has done more, I would say more than half of the
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.220]   third-party apps for the iPhone has pointed out that now they
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.540]   are using digital signing and encryption.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.220]   And she says it is highly unlikely, or it's going to be
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.540]   some time before anybody figures out how to put third-party
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.780]   apps back on this phone without Apple's help.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.180]   In other words, it's a much thornier problem than it was,
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.020]   which is discouraging.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.220]   I mean, it really does say--
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.140]   I mean, Apple's chosen to play hardball.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.220]   They're locking it down.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.860]   And I think that the most problematic thing, if it had
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.900]   come out of the gate like this, I don't think it would have
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.860]   been nearly the same problem that Apple has now.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.020]   They should have done that.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.420]   You're right.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.620]   Or at least communicate, we think this is a bad idea.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.620]   We're going to lock it down, and you shouldn't be developing
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.380]   stuff for it.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.460]   But the fact that we went two or three months with it just
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.340]   kind of rolling out, and people just slowly building up
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.060]   steam of, oh, this is going to be great.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.540]   And then to knock it down, I think it's just a mess.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.580]   She had a book contract.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.420]   She has to back out.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.660]   Yeah, so it's--
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.340]   Well, there are always solutions.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.460]   I mean, again, if I told you about the 72 hours that I had--
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.780]   all the things that had changed in the last 72 hours of finishing
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.300]   my iPhone book last week, there are always ways around it.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.660]   There is always hope.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.780]   And on top of everything else, the best way for Apple to take
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.420]   care of third-party apps to make this a non-issue is to give
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.020]   me the features that I want.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.060]   I don't necessarily-- I really don't want to write my own
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.260]   programs for the iPhone.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.220]   What I want is I want a book reader or a document reader
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:05.700]   that-- so I can load documents and information directly on my iPhone.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.300]   Every user, there's different needs and different wants.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.540]   That's why you need a third party, a vital third party team.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.900]   Well, what I was about to say is that I want this one
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.740]   critical feature.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.220]   And if Apple provides me with this one critical feature so
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.860]   that I can have a list of information that I can access,
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.300]   whether I have a cell signal or not, then I'm not going to go
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.660]   looking for it on the outside.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:32.180]   If Apple develops and encourages a library of software that addresses
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.300]   every need that the users will have and makes sure that they
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.140]   notice where the holes are in the software library, I don't
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.060]   necessarily care that I have to go to the iTunes store in order
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.300]   to download this stuff.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.460]   I don't care about who controls the platform.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.140]   I don't care about who controls the direction.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.740]   But that's a big--
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.540]   The long as my needs are being-- again, that's why-- oh, god.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.100]   So long as my needs are being met-- and again, there are going
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.780]   to be lots of individual users with individual needs.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.620]   So long as those needs are being met, my beef is not that
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.620]   Apple doesn't allow third party software.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.020]   My beef is that the software I want isn't available for the
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.740]   iPhone.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.220]   So whatever means that becomes possible, that's what makes
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.860]   me happy.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.060]   I'm not too worried about iTunes, but Chris's point is if
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.380]   Apple locks it down like that, it's up to them.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.700]   And clearly, Apple doesn't think we need a to-do list or
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.180]   cut and paste, and those seem to be fairly fundamental things.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.580]   Exactly.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.100]   So long as they pick up the ball that they just dropped, that's
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.900]   fine.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.900]   They have to go in and out.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.780]   But what a wonderful advantage they had.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.260]   They basically said, well, geez, we have 100 people that
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.100]   became 1,000 people that was on the track becoming 10,000
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.860]   people who are willing to add features to this phone for us.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.780]   So we always had to do a sit back, make sure that the
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.740]   iPod app keeps working, and count the money.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.220]   Yeah, so why didn't they?
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.140]   What's going on?
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.260]   They want a piece of it.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.420]   I think they want more.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.340]   They've got--
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.140]   And I don't have any problem.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.980]   I think, actually, oddly enough, as someone who does
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.700]   software development, I don't have a problem with it.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.500]   I'd love to be able to sell the software that I make for
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.820]   Final Cut Pro in the iTunes Store.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.180]   Let me point out that I have a piece of it.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.580]   I don't have a problem with it.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.900]   No one wants to deal with the e-commerce.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.980]   I don't want to deal with the e-commerce.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.980]   I'd rather just put it up on the eye.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.420]   You can buy Conduit or DB Mat on the iTunes Store.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.380]   I don't care about that.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.180]   This is how PlayStation 3 works.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.300]   This is how an Xbox 360 works.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.460]   A license fee goes to Microsoft.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.660]   They approve the products.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.220]   Nintendo's done it for years.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.660]   In fact, it was a response to a big problem in gaming.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.180]   Atari let anybody develop any kind of crap for the Atari.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.700]   It killed the platform.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.820]   So Nintendo said, wait a minute, we're going to make sure
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.740]   that everything that comes out for the Nintendo, for the
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.580]   NES, is good.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.420]   I think that's the way app we should do it.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.820]   We've set the suck flag in the firmware too false.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:49.300]   We would not allow you to re-flash it.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.620]   I wonder if that is a suck flag.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.020]   I think they should control it for the very same reason.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.260]   I wasn't terribly upset that they didn't allow the third
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.500]   party apps from the beginning, which is you want a stable
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.780]   environment, you want to ship a working phone that can
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.540]   actually make a call that actually has good battery life,
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.340]   then you gradually roll out stuff that you know is tested
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.340]   and safe.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.020]   And I do think that should happen.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.180]   And I think it will happen.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.180]   But imagine that happening to your computer.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.060]   I mean, let's shift this model.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.740]   Let's say they said that with the app.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.860]   That goes back to the fundamental question, is it a
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.060]   platform or a phone?
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.140]   And I'm choosing to think of it as a phone.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.220]   Yeah, but Steve says it's not a phone.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.860]   I mean, he says it's three different devices.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.180]   So suddenly, oh no, now it's a phone in this respect.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.660]   Well, he's going to have to get an old episode of "I Dream
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.260]   and Jeannie" and get some help.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.820]   Yeah, I'm buying a BlackBerry.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.340]   That's really--
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.060]   Honestly.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.180]   And I think that it's mostly because, yeah, I have third
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.460]   party apps on this hacked cell phone and I have a standard
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.140]   cell phone.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.460]   But I want that freedom.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.060]   And what's taken Apple so long?
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.980]   What's the hold up here?
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.180]   I mean, I hope--
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.820]   I'm articulating this properly.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.540]   I mean, you can buy there are now at least two different open
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.540]   source cell phone platforms.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.580]   And the problem is that both of them kind of suck at this
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.060]   point.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:03.820]   I mean, they work as phones.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.580]   They have kind of limited, nice Windows Mobile 2005 style
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.100]   apps on them.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.940]   But they're not exciting.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.700]   They're not interesting.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.580]   And then to me, they're not particularly useful.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.100]   An iPhone out of the box is more useful and more
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.940]   interesting than any open source phone that I've used.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.860]   So I'm not saying that we should all make sure that we
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.020]   mannequil ourselves to whatever terms that Apple wants.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.860]   I'm saying is that the goal is not to have access to any
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.940]   software we want.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.900]   Everybody's goal as individuals is to have the software they
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.020]   want to use.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.620]   So if Apple, again, if they're like Dr. Doom, and Dr. Doom,
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.700]   as he was written by John Byrne the good years back in the
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.500]   80s, where every single--
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.540]   he's a dictator.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.300]   He's a tyrant.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.300]   But everybody who lives under his rule is absolutely thrilled
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.940]   to have him as a governor because they're well-fed.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.820]   They're well-taken care of anything they want to do.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.740]   Doom will make sure that there's a way that they can do
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.380]   what they want to do.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.460]   All they have to do is acknowledge Doom as their one
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.580]   royal ruler.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.460]   I need a bell to ring for the first comic book
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.780]   reference in every episode now.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.220]   Sponsored by DC Comics.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.980]   DC Comics.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.500]   Count on.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.060]   Now, issue 28.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.060]   Will Sue Dibney come back from the dead to rescue Wonder Woman?
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.020]   What else is there to say about what happened?
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.940]   Have we covered the topic?
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.100]   Should we move on to the really big story, which is the new
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.260]   AOL desktop for Mac?
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.940]   Let's move on.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.140]   You really want to talk about the AOL desktop for Mac?
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.380]   No, but I think there are a couple other things to talk
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.660]   about.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.860]   Yes, there are, including the AOL desktop for Mac.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.940]   But we'll move on from that.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.580]   There are a number of updates, by the way, went out for iWork
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.820]   and iLife and new firmware.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.740]   For a lot of the computers, you certainly should run your
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.260]   software update.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.260]   I was surprised, boy, almost all the iLife apps.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.700]   I think all the iLife apps were updated, weren't they?
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.100]   Yeah, there are about seven updates all together, depending
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.140]   on what computer use.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.980]   And I installed all of them with no problem.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.540]   Everything works.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.820]   Apparently iWeb needed it, right?
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.180]   Yes.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.540]   There was something wrong with--
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.540]   I don't use iWeb, but people were saying there's a real
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.540]   problem.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.620]   By the way, one thing that was introduced with 111, which
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.940]   is probably a bug.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.700]   And I read this in Apple Insider.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.460]   You can keep the sound coming out through your Bluetooth
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.380]   headset.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.580]   It's a complicated hack.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.540]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.380]   But basically, if you go to voicemail, you select your
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.340]   Bluetooth headset--
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.340]   I don't know if you have to listen to the voicemail or not.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.500]   But then go back, everything coming out of the
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.540]   computer, out of the iPhone, including keyboard clicks and
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.860]   music, goes to your wireless headset.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.140]   I don't know if that's A2DP.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.140]   It's probably not stereo.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.700]   But at least you can now use your wireless headset for
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.500]   music.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.940]   How long the Apple fixes that?
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.900]   Breaks your headset.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.140]   Breaks your headset.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.460]   I clearly a bug on their part.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.700]   I don't think that's an intentional.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.860]   I think that--
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.420]   seriously, so many times I've gotten to the root of some of
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.980]   these so-called bugs.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.180]   It turns out that it was one engineer at the company who
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.500]   wanted this to work.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.380]   And so he just basically decided not to put it
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.580]   into something or decided something that he would know
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.900]   how to do, but no one else would.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.820]   Well, it was discovered pretty quickly.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:11.140]   Hey, whether this is Jermaine or not, Steve Jobs is now the--
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.260]   actually he's slipped a little bit.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.260]   He is now the 56th richest man in the world with an
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.620]   estimated worth of $5.7 billion.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.940]   You're looking at--
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.260]   I'm really sorry to see that there are 55 below me.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.100]   This is Leopard Month.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.340]   Are we excited about Leopard with all this attention to the
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:32.700]   iPhone?
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.460]   Let's not forget.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.540]   Leopard's supposed to come out in October.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.420]   I thought it was supposed to.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.540]   Well, I think supposed to--
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.860]   I thought the other thing that was interesting was the
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.700]   announcement related to bootcamp expiring.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.460]   Bootcamp expiring, yeah.
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.220]   And it's coinciding with Leopard's release.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.220]   Apple is going to shoot a warning to bootcamp users.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.460]   Beta software is on track to expire this month.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.300]   It expires.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:56.660]   Break everything!
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.860]   Break in that beta!
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.700]   Break it all!
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.460]   Break it all!
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.340]   But what they are saying is it expires when Leopard becomes
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:03.780]   available.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.180]   So in a way, this is a back-handed way of saying Leopard
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.820]   will come out this month, right?
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.740]   I'm really concerned about that.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.660]   I've not seen stuff happening here that makes me think that
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.860]   Leopard is--
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.500]   I don't know.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.300]   Maybe they've got all the good stuff done.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.340]   It's like the last launch of Apollo before they put men in
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   the vehicle, we had a lot of problems.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.340]   But they felt they understood what the problems were, so
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.660]   they launched Apollo 6 as planned.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.460]   But I'm just not seeing a really good, stable, shippable
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.620]   operating system at this point.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.780]   It looks like the last update was what, about a week ago,
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.900]   Friday?
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.100]   Yeah, the 21st.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.300]   We've seen a commercial that makes us think it's going to
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.060]   be late.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.580]   What did the commercial say?
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.980]   It says Leopard, the new Vista.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.460]   I'm wondering if Leopard's going to come out and people
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.900]   are going to be disappointed if they're going to say, well,
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.540]   there's a lot of pressure on Leopard
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.940]   to be of Vista, a big upgrade.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.900]   We should point out it's not 11.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.620]   It's 10.5.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.620]   I don't know that that's really true.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.460]   Apple has certainly rolled out lots of really cool new
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.380]   features, but they haven't really been banging the drum about
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:16.740]   it.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.700]   I don't know whether that's because it's been drowned out
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.740]   by bigger stuff, namely the iPhone.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:25.380]   But I just don't get a vibe from Apple that says that they're
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.380]   prepared to say to the world, oh my god, if Jesus Christ
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.660]   comes tomorrow and takes your soul to heaven, you'll be pissed
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.700]   off because that means you'll only get to use Leopard for 48
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.420]   or 40 hours before you go to heaven.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.140]   That's the ad I want to see.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:39.940]   I should work for Apple.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.500]   Foy would be so more.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.860]   All you've got to do is bring Jesus Christ into it.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.780]   And do it in a way that might be biblical in nature, and boy,
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.700]   will people be on your side.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.780]   That's how America works.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.260]   So we go from the Jesus phone to the Jesus Big Cat.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.020]   Yeah, but I do think that people have expectations
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:54.780]   of the Leopard in it.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.180]   Not because Apple is doing it, but a lot of it is partly due
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.540]   to the delay.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.220]   It was supposed to ship in the summer.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.580]   And now they say, no, no, no, we're
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.460]   going to wait until October because we need these resources.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.500]   However, people would then say, OK, well, you've
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.860]   had these extra months to really do something spectacular here.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.060]   And although we can't talk specifically about stuff
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.980]   that we've seen in the beta, if we need, we have, the stuff
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.180]   that we have seen on the web, for example, people
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.220]   are having a real hard time with a lot of these interface
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.220]   things.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:24.180]   And then you barbing sort of translucent.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.420]   And the doc has just sort of gotten
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.140]   strange because the analogy doesn't work anymore.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.340]   You put it on the side and what?
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.540]   We've got a shelf on the side.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.460]   And what's--
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.940]   Everything's falling off.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.500]   Yeah, what's it doing there?
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:35.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.100]   We have issued an advisory that says,
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.420]   if you try to move the spots around on leopard,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.100]   it will brick it.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.700]   Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.900]   So I'm a little worried.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.020]   I am a little worried about all the software I'm running
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.260]   and how compatible it will be.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.500]   I've seen some updates of software to work with Leopard.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.780]   And presumably, developers have had a lot of time to work with it.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.100]   But I'm sticking with OS9.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.260]   Well, I'm wondering.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.740]   Gosh, the temptation is going to be great to install Leopard
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.780]   right away.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.900]   That happened in here.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.740]   Really?
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.220]   I'm in a production environment, so I can't--
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.980]   You can't even think about it.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.900]   We have a permanent window sticky note on the monitor.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:18.260]   It says, do not install or run any OS updates without permission.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.100]   Well, I can tell you that I have a separate Mac that's
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.620]   designed for Leopard.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.140]   And at least twice in the past two or three months,
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.300]   I've gone from having a working thing to a not working thing,
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.780]   where it's like, OK, fire, wear our disc mode.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.660]   You're a start all over again.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.260]   Well, I'm with Chris.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.660]   I think that whether rightly or wrongly, people
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.500]   are expecting a big, big update, I think there's a lot of eye
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.140]   candy.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.580]   Is there a lot of stuff under the hood?
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.620]   Alex, you're probably looking at this pretty closely,
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.420]   that you think is going to make a big difference, big updates
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.860]   to Core Audio or Core Video.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.380]   No, I have to admit.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.900]   There's Core Animation, which I don't think
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.700]   is going to make any kind of real effect on what we're doing
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.740]   tomorrow.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.620]   But it's going to do a lot of the same things
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.980]   that Core Audio and Core Video have done to--
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.980]   in Core Image have done to other areas.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.340]   I mean, the things that we're seeing, like Acorn and Pixel
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.620]   Nader and everything else are partially
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.260]   a result of Core Image and a lot of the stuff that they're being
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:13.740]   handed.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.820]   I know for a lot of stuff that we do,
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.540]   when we're developing stuff to the underlying layers,
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.180]   the great thing is I don't have to figure out
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.460]   all these different pieces that I'd have to figure out on a PC.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.460]   I just say, well, just go get me the video.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.100]   And then I'm going to do this work on it.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.740]   And I think that that's going to make a lot of things easier.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.380]   To be honest with you, as far as the user features go,
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.060]   I haven't really been paying much attention.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.740]   I'm pretty happy.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.060]   I think the problem that I have is that I'm pretty happy
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.420]   with the operating system I have now.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.060]   I don't have this--
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.820]   there hasn't been a lot of what I've seen from--
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.300]   except for spaces, maybe.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.420]   There hasn't been a lot that I've seen that I go, oh,
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.140]   that'd be really something that I need to have.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.700]   And I think that's the interesting thing for me,
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.140]   is that I'm not--
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.620]   for the first time in a while, I don't think I'm not really
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.700]   just waiting to update.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.140]   We'll probably update sometime in January.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:02.580]   Can I see?
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.460]   I can't wait to update.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:04.820]   Chris Breen--
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.460]   I can't afford to.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.140]   I mean, I understand you don't want to risk it.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.580]   Chris Breen, obviously you'll update some machines.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.300]   You have to for real.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.420]   Yeah, I'll have to update some of the machines.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.980]   And I'm looking forward to it.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.340]   But again, my production machine's not going to be updated.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.900]   I'll certainly play around with stuff.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.940]   I want to check on compatibility.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.740]   I'll be the guinea pig.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.620]   I'm going to put it on every machine the day it comes out.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.460]   Really?
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.460]   Just make sure that your computer is not
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.940]   connected to any network.
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.020]   Because we could have a Skynet sort of situation
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.820]   if we could just be as big as we could be.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.180]   I am the voice of user control.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.340]   You are mine.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.140]   It would be instant there at a 410 PM.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.260]   Right, so you're going to be recording Macbreak weekly,
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.300]   then through telephone.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.260]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.020]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.820]   I record it on a Windows machine anyway.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.660]   So I'm so--
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:50.660]   Oh my god.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.500]   Oh.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.380]   Shocking, shocking.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.220]   My pitch, my lovely, lovely audio pitch.
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.340]   I'll tell you if being touched by Bill Gates, I'm done to prove.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.620]   I done to prove.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:04.300]   I may just run out and buy this Gateway 20th anniversary, Mac.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:04.940]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:05.620]   It's the one.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.580]   What am I saying?
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.460]   What was I thinking?
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.580]   Gateway's got an all-in-one computer called The One.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.060]   Are they still a business?
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.940]   They were bought by Acer.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.380]   So this is really an Acer.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.380]   Interesting.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.940]   The number of people have said, oh, it's an iMac.
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.660]   But really, if you look at it next to the 20th anniversary, Mac,
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.860]   it looks a lot like it.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:31.980]   Does anybody still have a 20th anniversary?
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.820]   I had one.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.220]   I should have picked one up when they were cheap.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:35.980]   I wish I'd had one, yeah.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.860]   Look good on the never-
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.140]   I should have if you're long enough to know
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.660]   what the last one was.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.100]   That was the-- do you remember that one?
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.260]   That was one of the speakers on the side.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.860]   It was flat.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.420]   It only had-- looked like, I don't know what, 12-inch screen.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.580]   It was a tiny little screen.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.660]   But yeah, they released it very much like the iPhone.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.060]   They put it under glass at Expo.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.500]   So you'd go around and steam up glass and look at it.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.100]   But you'd not catch on it.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.380]   It was not a popular product.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.660]   That was horribly expensive when it came out.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.300]   Tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.940]   I do think that I know the market for this Gateway, the One.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.780]   If you look at a picture of it, I
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.660]   think that Apple should buy one of them for every Apple store,
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.220]   spray-painted red, put a new plastic face plate on it
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:14.980]   because the exact same screen size
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.820]   and proportions as a new iPod Nano.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.420]   They should use them as jumbo demonstrator nano's.
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.100]   You're right.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.780]   It's red.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:23.860]   Well, you know in the--
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.140]   The color details on it, you've got a little pusion--
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.380]   little pusion user interface.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.540]   If you crash the iPhone demo at the AT&T stores,
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.340]   guess what comes up?
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.100]   Windows.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:33.580]   Oh.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.940]   It's not running on an app.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.900]   The fact that you're capable of crashing it, kind of--
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:37.180]   There you go.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.500]   That shows you right there.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.340]   Well, it's been brick now, so it won't even run.
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.820]   Let's break the demo, see how they feel.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.540]   Let's see.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:51.540]   Apple's OS X market share up according to Net applications.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.540]   The way they do this is interesting.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.780]   They actually look at browser uses.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.180]   And assuming the browsers aren't lying,
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:05.340]   Apple's worldwide installed base rose to 6.6% last month.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.740]   A lot of new Intel systems out there.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.780]   Safari also showing healthy share gains,
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.460]   which means I would guess that a lot of these new Macs
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.300]   are new users.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.260]   They're new to Mac, and they just use Safari,
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.420]   because that's what it comes with.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.740]   Are they tracking Safari on Windows use?
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:20.860]   Or did they separate that out?
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.140]   Ah, that's a good question.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.220]   Maybe they are.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.740]   Let me see if I can figure that out from the article.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.740]   I'm reading the article from Apple Insider,
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.700]   which has got pie charts.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.100]   Oh, well, that's--
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:31.620]   That must be--
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.060]   They look like they were done in open office.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.020]   I have to say.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.260]   There's no way this is numbers.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.300]   Net applications.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.220]   Net applications uses a Safari browser up.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.620]   It showed the largest share gain of any other browser
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.780]   during September.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.500]   Still, it's 5%.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.220]   But I have to tell you, when I see these graphs,
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.340]   you need an explorer on this one is 77%.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.580]   And then I look at the graphs on my website.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.980]   Internet Explorer is the trailing fourth well
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.180]   behind Firefox Safari, even Opera.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.340]   It just shows you, if you look at the overall audience
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.780]   versus a tech savvy audience, is it possible?
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.620]   It shows you the difference between the power of what
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.900]   comes pre-installed on a machine versus something
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.140]   you have to go out and get.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.700]   True.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:15.980]   True.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.780]   True.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.260]   Net applications doesn't tell us how it does its methodology.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.300]   So it's not clear whether it's Windows or--
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.420]   I don't think-- can you think there's widespread adoption
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.700]   of Safari on Windows?
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.980]   No, I don't think so.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.660]   I can't see.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.700]   People probably played with it.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.020]   And they said, oh, good.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.060]   There's somebody playing with it.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.500]   And that counts.
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.660]   We'll check in that column.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.500]   Also, to be fair, Firefox is much prettier than Safari.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.140]   If features aside, Firefox looks more appealing
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.900]   than Safari on Windows.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.180]   Because it works great.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.300]   It works fast.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.860]   But they seem to have shoehorned the interface a little bit
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.740]   to make it work as a Windows window.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.660]   And I'm just not sure if it doesn't have that curbside appeal
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.140]   that Firefox has.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:02.300]   How are we feeling about the Amazon Store one week afterwards?
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.140]   And we didn't get to ask you about how you feel about it,
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.700]   Chris Breen.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.180]   I've been using it.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.020]   I love it.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   I absolutely love it.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.180]   I think it's wonderful.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.500]   I don't care if it's Universal's plot
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.620]   to take over the world and destroy iTunes.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.420]   It makes it very easy to do this.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:22.220]   It integrates very nicely with iTunes.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:24.740]   I like being able to buy stuff cheaper without DRM.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.660]   And so--
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.020]   Yeah, I'm a sucker for it.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.260]   It is a lot cheaper.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.380]   I mean, if you include the DRM price for iTunes,
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.900]   is what, what, buck 29?
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:32.260]   And most--
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.540]   Buck 29 and most single-tracer 89.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.580]   So you're saving $0.40.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.100]   $0.40?
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.100]   That's a lot.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.500]   Buy a couple of buying album and you'll
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.460]   be able to buy a lot of thing.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.580]   Yeah, and some of the albums by the way.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.780]   But then we'd be in a Starbucks.
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.820]   And my god, I have to use the iPhone and oh no.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.380]   I have to admit that I am finding myself looking more often
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.820]   like, oh, I really want to get that album.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.420]   And I go, well, maybe I'm going to go to Amazon
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.740]   and just see if it's there.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.820]   Because I'm really--
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.300]   And they cut the--
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.820]   Go ahead.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:00.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.740]   No, it's just that I really--
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.500]   it's the DRM thing and being able to get 256 DRM is--
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.220]   the money doesn't really--
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.020]   I mean, it's not like money doesn't matter.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:12.380]   But the difference between the price and the songs
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.820]   doesn't really matter that much to me
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.020]   if I'm looking for something.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.540]   But what really does matter is that, oh, I don't have--
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.380]   it's a much higher quality track.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.580]   And I'm not going to have to go through any kind of process
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.220]   to do DRM.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.460]   Right.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.460]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.460]   What were you going to say?
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.900]   I was just going to say that I'm not sure if Apple is
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.300]   doubly unhappy about this.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.620]   But I find myself using iTunes to look for music
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.060]   and to sample the music.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.020]   But then my next step before clicking the buy button
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.340]   is to go to Amazon.com.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.100]   See if it's available there.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.620]   I go back to iTunes if it's not available on Amazon.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:45.100]   I have to say--
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.900]   And I think, though, as a test case, I ask my daughter.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.140]   Because I think we do that.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.260]   And I told my daughter about it.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.220]   And I said, oh, please, before you buy anything,
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.140]   I'd really appreciate it if you would go to Amazon
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.060]   and check to see if it's there first.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.700]   Because then you can get on a protected version.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.100]   We could put it on all our computers instead of just five of them.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.900]   And she said, no, that's too much trouble.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.260]   And I think she might be a reasonable test case, actually.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.060]   So I think that is.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.380]   Because I think iTunes definitely still
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.580]   has the advantage that it's much more convenient.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.740]   You can find things very easily at the iTunes store.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.260]   If you go into Amazon, you're still
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.460]   using that Amazon web browser interface.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.900]   So it's not as easy to find stuff.
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   And she doesn't, unlike us, she doesn't buy a lot of stuff.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.260]   I don't think she buys any stuff on Amazon.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.860]   So she's not familiar with it.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.980]   She just said that she rejected it out of hand.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.380]   She said, no, I don't care.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.860]   It gets back to a universal problem.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.380]   It's not going to be really a problem.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.060]   It's that we're not normal users.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.820]   And for normal users, they hit a real glass ceiling
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.460]   when something becomes good enough for them.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.540]   Yeah, once they've figured it out,
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.660]   they don't want to learn something new.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.860]   Well, not necessarily that.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.500]   But if it takes five minutes to give somebody 90% of a topic,
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.220]   such as downloadable digital and digital music,
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.420]   that's usually good enough for them.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.540]   But if you're going to say, look, if you have another hour
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.340]   to give-- I can give you that extra 10% that will make it
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:00.820]   so much bigger and more wonderful for you, they'll say, no, I'm good.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:01.460]   I got 90.
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.300]   90's all I need.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:02.820]   Yep.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:03.500]   Well, I think you're right.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.980]   I think that's actually a good rule of thumb.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.660]   All right, I think we've covered all the stories today.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.460]   I'd like to get our picks going.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.740]   Chris Breen, I won't start with you because I'm springing on you.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.060]   So think for a moment.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.340]   Let's get Andy and not go.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.100]   Oh, before we do the picks, before we do the picks,
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.180]   let me do my audible pick.
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.540]   The show is sponsored by audible.com.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:28.260]   As it has been for some time now, we do thank audible.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.020]   It's a great way.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.540]   And I know a number of us use audible.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.660]   It's a great way to listen to books instead of reading them.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.500]   And boy, there's always downtime in the car or in the garden
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.340]   or in the gym when you can listen to a book and just learn
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.100]   so much.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.140]   45,000 titles growing all the time--
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:48.860]   nonfiction and fiction, business, humor, radio shows,
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.180]   all sorts of stuff.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:55.060]   But we wanted you to give it a try by going to audible.com/macbreak--
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.820]   audible, a-u-d-i-b-l-e.com/macbreak.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.740]   You get a credit toward a free book when you sign up there.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.540]   And there's no cost or obligation
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.140]   if you decide to drop audible.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.420]   You keep the book.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.780]   But we also want to remind you, you
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.020]   can get a free chapter of the new Chopin manuscript,
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.140]   which is Audible's first original production, a book written
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.260]   by 15 different thriller authors, one chapter after another.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.340]   It's a great idea.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.300]   And you can hear that first chapter written by Jeffrey
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.460]   D. We're absolutely free.
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:21.000]   Now everybody can stream it, but we've
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.900]   got a special place you can go to download and put it
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.500]   on your iPod.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.540]   That's audible.com/freechapter--
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.940]   audible.com/freechapter.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.580]   And don't forget if you want to sign up for Audible.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.140]   You don't have to get that free chapter.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:34.100]   But if you decide you want to, I think you will.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.540]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.140]   I use it.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:37.820]   I love it.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.460]   I think you will too.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.220]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.460]   We thank them for their support.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:48.100]   Now time for Andy and Ako's pick of the week.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.340]   Audible or Mac--
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:49.700]   either.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.060]   Do you have a book you want to mention?
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.100]   I have a book.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.500]   I have a Mac pick that I'm just tingling.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.860]   I think it's so great.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.220]   Do the Mac pick.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:58:59.860]   Well, you know what?
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.260]   I'm not going to tell you what you do.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.780]   You do whatever you want.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.060]   OK, I'll save the Audible pick for next week,
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.660]   because I tend to hog the Audible picks.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.940]   But there is-- I have found what I feel
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:16.100]   to be the best iPhone online app ever.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.540]   It might be the greatest online app I have ever seen.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:24.660]   And it fills a huge gaping hole in the iPhone user experience.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:25.860]   I think I know what you're going to say.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.860]   But I'm going to write down my answer
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.620]   and put it in an envelope right here.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.740]   And I'll open it after you make your pick.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.100]   OK.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.500]   Sis-boom-ba.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.620]   What is the sound a sheep makes when exploding?
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.180]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.940]   Your character!
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   Go ahead.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:43.380]   You're a pick.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:46.260]   After that buildup.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:50.220]   We have seen-- like the first day the iPhone was available,
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.580]   everybody who had some sort of 2.0 portal,
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:56.420]   who wanted to get some ink, would announce that, oh, well,
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   we have an online app for the iPhone that will let you create
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.540]   and edit Microsoft Office documents on the iPhone.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.060]   And it's good.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:03.860]   And it's wonderful.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.700]   And it's completely Microsoft Office.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.900]   And you say, OK, that's cool.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.900]   And you go visit it.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.460]   And you find out that they've had this existing web-based
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.260]   version of Office.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.860]   And all they did was they changed a couple of style sheets
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.500]   to sort of make it kind of work on the iPhone,
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.420]   but not really because they didn't resize the screen
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.020]   so that it fits on the iPhone screen.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.780]   And stupid things like you can open up a spreadsheet,
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.340]   but you can't edit anything because nothing can
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.820]   cause the on-screen virtual keyboard to come up.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.300]   Two weeks ago about this version of Edit Grid
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.820]   came online for the iPhone.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.780]   You can see the desktop version of this spreadsheet program
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.620]   at editgrid.com, E-D-I-T-G-R-I-D.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.460]   But they've also now created an iPhone edition of Edit Grid
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.540]   so if you point your iPhone then to iphone.editgrid.com,
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:58.300]   what you have is a real sophisticated, fudgy, nougat-centered
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.140]   version of a spreadsheet application for the iPhone.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.700]   When you see the interface, you will
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.100]   think it's a native application that's running
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.300]   because it has a very, very mature interface with pop-ups
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.580]   and push buttons and all that of the kind of cool stuff.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.620]   Not only that, though, it's so well designed.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.780]   It's designed for humans.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.540]   For all those buttons that are on there,
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.860]   it's really clear and it's really, really easy to use.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.340]   You can upload existing spreadsheets to editgrid.com,
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.380]   use it on the desktop, use it on the iPhone.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.060]   You can create brand new spreadsheets.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.300]   Those spreadsheets are live documents
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.900]   so that if you want to do recalculations,
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.380]   if you want to add new information,
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.620]   if you want to sort on tables, it'll do that.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.860]   It does charts.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.300]   It will do small spreadsheets.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.380]   It'll do huge ones.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.220]   Not only that, but this is what I love.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:44.060]   I love when I see an application where somebody stopped,
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.500]   stopped all the development and said, look, guys,
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.900]   we have to think about how this is going to actually work out.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.660]   If we stop for 30 minutes right now and plan this out,
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.340]   we can make it 40 times better.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.900]   And this one feature they have,
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.220]   when you open up a spreadsheet,
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:01.260]   the first question it asks you is, okay, look,
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.020]   we can open this in one of three different ways.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.500]   If it's a huge spreadsheet,
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.020]   we can sort of cut down on all the touchy-feely interface
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.260]   to make it work faster.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.100]   However, if it's smaller and more manageable,
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.660]   we can make it look a lot cooler
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.620]   when you're actually using this,
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:13.660]   when you're scrolling around.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.740]   But it's up to you, we're not going to make that decision for you.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.500]   And for us, Rachel, we're going to simply give you these options,
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.100]   just tell us what to do and we will do it.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.700]   It's wonderful. You sign up for the service.
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.140]   It's free, like most web-based services.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.980]   It's free up to a certain point.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.740]   If you want to put loads and loads and loads of spreadsheets on there,
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.180]   and if you want to share it with lots and lots and lots of people,
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.020]   you can do it that way.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.340]   But in terms of having an ability to build lists and sort lists
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:42.100]   and put databases on my iPhone and add and sync those databases,
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:47.340]   editgrid.com needs to be in every single person's desktop and iPhone bookmark folder.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.820]   I just found out about this like four days ago,
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:54.460]   and it's been an open tab in my Safari browser on my browser,
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.420]   both on my desktop and my iPhone, ever since.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.380]   It's wonderful.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.820]   It's pretty impressive. I have to say.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.980]   It actually looks a lot better than Google Spreadsheet.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.900]   Google Spreadsheet looks terrible compared to this.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.340]   It's not even the best online spreadsheet program.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.740]   This looks like something you would pay 50 bucks for as a downloadable app.
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.180]   You can't see where this is an online thing.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:12.980]   It's beautiful.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.100]   Very cool.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:19.980]   That is editgrid.com, and there is a version available for the iPhone as well,
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.900]   if you want to use it.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.660]   And by the way, no hack required.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:25.860]   Yes.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.660]   When you start to talk about an iPhone app, I thought, "I've got to run an iPhone app."
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.740]   I thought, "Oh my God, it's iPhone.Editgrid.com."
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.020]   If you're on an iPhone right now, listening to us and you want to try it out.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.020]   Alex Lindsey, your pick.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.580]   I have one. I'm pretty sure that I haven't recommended this in the past.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.860]   I was going through picks of the week.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.900]   I can't remember.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.380]   I'm using it so much right now that I felt like, "Oh, I should really talk about this."
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.460]   Because I don't remember. I was looking through Mac break picks of the week.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.540]   By the way, this is a great site.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.620]   I haven't been to it before.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.700]   What would be really great is someone we had a list.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.140]   Just the list instead of descriptions.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.580]   Because I can't.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.180]   Oh, come on.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.580]   Just use the search.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.860]   There's two of them. There's mbwpics.com and there's mbwpicsoftheweek.com.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.380]   They both have a search.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.980]   There's the search.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.580]   I don't know how to use a web page.
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:14.100]   We talked about this. I'm a little broken here.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.980]   The one that I'm using a lot in it, and if I haven't set it before,
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.020]   even if I've set it before, it's been a long time ago and I should say it again,
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:23.020]   is have I talked about Google Sketchup?
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.340]   No, I don't think you have.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.340]   OK.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:30.220]   We've done that. We've covered it so much on the TV show.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.220]   You've talked about it.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.820]   We've covered it, of course, on Mac break.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.580]   But I don't think we've ever talked about it on Mac break.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.220]   As far as I can tell, we haven't.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.700]   And it is such a fun application to work with.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.060]   Now, this used to be a company called At Last,
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.460]   and they were out of Boulder, Colorado,
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.020]   and they got bought by Google a while ago.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.820]   And Google's really used it as a way for you to build content in the Google Earth,
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.540]   which I do think we've talked about, and it's an amazing application.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.540]   Kind of have to have it.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.780]   And so what you can do is you can-- now there's two versions of it.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:02.700]   One of them, I think, is the Google Sketchup, there's one that's free.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.980]   So then there's Sketchup Pro.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.980]   And Sketchup Pro is mostly used by architects and people
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.660]   who are doing pre-visualization for film and people who are just sketching out ideas.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.660]   And they actually want to build it as part of a larger pipe.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.380]   But Google Sketchup, the base version, has all the features,
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.660]   except it just doesn't export to other 3D applications.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.140]   It has limited rendering.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.260]   But outside of that, you can do all this modeling.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.980]   And the modeling is not really hard.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.820]   I know a lot of people think of 3D modeling, and they're like, oh, I don't know what I can--
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.060]   you know, I don't know where I'm going to go with that.
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:35.180]   With Google Sketchup, what you can do is you can actually--
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.420]   you draw it like you would.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.020]   You just draw little lines, and you, oh, I just want to make these a little higher,
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.460]   and then you just draw a window in and pop it out.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.700]   And then you draw a little roof, and you pop the middle of it up.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.260]   And it's very, very straightforward.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.660]   There's great tutorials that will actually play in the application.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:54.100]   So you can play them for a little while and stop and play with it a little bit.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.980]   Really, really well thought on application.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.860]   And if you just want to play with a little bit of 3D,
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:03.740]   and what I use it for is doing-- we're working on doing some--
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:08.060]   putting together a little theater slash booths and everything else at Macworld.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.580]   And so I'm planning out how we're going to do all of this stuff.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.140]   And I'm just able to pop these little models out.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:18.260]   Now, I have a lot of other 3D applications at my disposal.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:22.860]   And this is the one that I'm choosing to use because I can do it really, really fast.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.100]   You know, I just move things around.
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.260]   And now, there's a lot of things it doesn't do that I like to do with the other 3D applications,
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:33.420]   whether it's Moto or Cinema 4D or XSI or any of the other ones that I use.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.780]   But this one is a great one if you're just kind of sketching things out.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.860]   And I just kind of want to block things out.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.500]   And you can build a lot of detail into them.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:45.220]   Now, if you go the next step, you can build, for instance, a model of your house.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:50.140]   And we've talked about this on Macbreak and on the lab.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.820]   You can go into Google Earth and say, I want to build-- you know, you find your house on
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:54.980]   satellite.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.860]   And then you can hit Send That to Google SketchUp.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.860]   So if you have Google SketchUp, it'll send that image that you can see there in Google
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.860]   Earth to Google SketchUp.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.220]   And so now you see your house.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.100]   Now, if you build it in the same scale-- so if the outside of your house, for instance,
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:12.620]   or any building you want to have fits the outline on the satellite-- you can build it
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.620]   up.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:16.020]   You can use photographs to just kind of do what we call photogrammetry.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:20.220]   So you can take a couple of photographs from the ground and use them to help model your
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.300]   little building.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.380]   And then you can-- from Google SketchUp, you can say, send that back to Google Earth.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:31.460]   It will send that model back and place it in the world exactly where it needs to be.
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:35.500]   And you know, in there-- now you can then, if you want-- now that's just for you.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.260]   But if you want to, you can then send that to what's called 3D Warehouse, which is something
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.580]   that anybody can get ahold of.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.380]   And if you load it, there's lots of people who are posting stuff.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:51.580]   I mean, you can get everything from the towers in Toronto, the CN Tower in Toronto to-- I
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.980]   mean, there's buildings in Harari, you know, Zimbabwe.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.860]   There's almost all of Kampala.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.380]   Uganda is built out in 3D models.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.380]   That's interesting.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.380]   I wonder why that is.
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.780]   Is that because of you?
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.780]   No, it's not because of me.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.540]   The only reason I discovered it is because I was using Google Earth to figure out how
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.380]   to get to a meeting while I was in Kampala.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:14.700]   And suddenly, I just-- you know, I have this thing that's always downloading the 3D Warehouse
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.700]   stuff.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   And suddenly, this whole 3D model just popped up of Kampala.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.980]   It's an herbal stuff.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.340]   It's a terrible stuff.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.380]   It's funny talking to the guys who-- because our-- our Pixel Go members are actually building
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:33.300]   the buildings in Harari, because they do other work for Google Earth.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.860]   So they build other models, you know, from all over the world.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.700]   And-- but the-- so-- but more as for fun they're doing it there.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.380]   And the big sensitivity is, yeah, you can-- you see lots of models of business buildings.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:47.540]   You just don't see any models oddly enough of the government buildings.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.420]   You know, you got to keep those things out of hand.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.020]   But-- but there-- it's a-- it's a really, really fun application.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.420]   If anyone has an-- if-- I now really say if people want to get started, if they just
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.380]   want to start playing with something in 3D, they just want to start thinking about what
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.380]   that is.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:09.020]   It's a free-- something free that they can just start-- just start hacking out little models.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.580]   I would highly suggest downloading it.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.780]   It doesn't cost you anything.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.180]   And well worth the time.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.580]   And we have a couple of Mac breaks that talk about SketchUp, including a couple of interviews
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:22.100]   with the folks from school who do a great DVD for a learning SketchUp if you want.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.620]   It's the best training you're going to find on it.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:29.580]   So I mean, school, you know, and that's Alex Oliver and-- and-- and a couple of guys too.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.060]   And I-- I'd like to give them a plug.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:37.340]   So SketchUp and if you want to learn more, school makes the great DVDs for SketchUp.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.380]   I'm going to mention-- a program I probably mentioned before, Red Sweater Software at
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:49.020]   Daniel Jaikut's company has picked up Mars Edit, which is a really handy blog editor that
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.780]   I'd used before when it was still with Ranchero software.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:57.900]   And I was really kind of glad to hear that Red Sweater had bought it because frankly,
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.060]   you know, Ranchero wasn't keeping it up today.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.020]   And-- and there was a lot of potential there.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:07.300]   Well, the new 2.0 version of Mars Edit has come out and well, well worth it.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.020]   I use it-- I have a WordPress blog now.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.060]   And Andy, I know you're going to WordPress.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.740]   It's something to look at if you want a client that will post to WordPress.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:18.100]   WordPress actually has pretty good posting capability, web-based, cook-based posting capability.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:24.020]   But it's really nice to have the ability to script your posting, to add pictures from
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.220]   Flickr, to put HTML tags in and-- and all.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.580]   And I just-- I just really love Mars Edit.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:35.860]   And so I wanted to give Daniel a little bit of a plug and point people to red-sweater.com.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:40.460]   They do a lot of stuff, but Mars Edit is the one in particular that I think is well worth
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   looking at.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.340]   You can download and try before you buy if you decide you want to keep it $30.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.340]   Well worth it.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.340]   That's how I do all my blog posting now.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.580]   And it's really increased my output quite a bit.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.300]   Off to Scott Born, who has a pick, no doubt.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.220]   Yes, I do.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.780]   I do some consulting here and there.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   And I charge by the hour.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.580]   I've tried various pieces of software to track my hourly time.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:09.660]   And somebody sent me a link to this thing, which I just started using a couple of weeks
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:13.260]   ago called On the Job by Stunt Software.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.260]   And I have to tell you, it's pretty brilliant.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.340]   It's only $25.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.780]   And it lets you check your time on a job if you're doing consulting.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.620]   You start a clock, so to speak.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:26.100]   And there's a lot of programs that do that.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.660]   But what's cool about this one is that it will automatically create an invoice for you.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.780]   So you just-- when you're done, you get an invoice and it comes in any form like a PDF,
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.780]   whatever.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.340]   And you can customize the invoice.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.420]   And if you forget to turn off your clock, which I sometimes do, it's got an idle time
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.300]   checker that reminds you when the last time you did something was.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.900]   So you can approximate when you actually were done working for that person and doing that
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.260]   consulting job.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.900]   And it's from a company called Stunt Software.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.100]   And it has a free trial.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   It's $25.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.100]   Very good.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.060]   Very good.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.060]   Check it out.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.220]   I don't work for anybody, so I don't really need it.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.300]   And you don't have to use this in that format.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.420]   I mean, if you wanted simply to be able to use some sort of time tracker to see how much
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.100]   time you're spending on something like how much--
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.100]   How much time--
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.100]   --dane should be using this.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.020]   Well, you should be using it to check your time on Halo 3.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.900]   Ha, ha, ha, ha, wait too much.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.340]   I don't want to-- truth is, I don't want to know.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.020]   That's the real problem on that one.
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.700]   So that is, I don't know, one 20th of an Alex.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.140]   Yeah, it's a pretty cheap pick for me.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.580]   Expensive pick.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.260]   By the way, I wanted to clarify that Mars that it isn't just WordPress.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:36.740]   It's also Blogger, TypePad, Mobile Type Live, Journal, Drupal, Vox, all
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.140]   of the different blog platforms.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.540]   It's very compatible.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:43.380]   And by the way, Andy, it was an edit grid that I had in this envelope.
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:47.260]   I thought you were going to mention Navazon, which is an amazing third party app that
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.420]   does, in fact, require a hack of the iPhone.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   But it adds--
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.260]   It kind of adds-- you've tried it, so I'll get your impressions.
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.860]   It doesn't work in Petaluma because, unfortunately, you can't add points.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:01.100]   But it's using Wi-Fi access points, known Wi-Fi access points, and known cell
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:05.580]   towers to pinpoint you, in urban areas, at least where I've tried it, including Vancouver
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.660]   and San Francisco, it does a great job.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.300]   But there's no way to add these points.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.020]   I'm sure the clients and other phones let you add points.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.820]   How does it work in Boston?
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.260]   It's very, very spotty.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:21.220]   Unfortunately, the place where I downloaded it was in my house, which is not, like, on
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:25.260]   the sticks, but it's about a 20-minute drive in Boston, and it didn't find nothing.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.260]   Petaluma either.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:33.300]   And I think way before we've talked about this, that the first user experience, the first-click
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.660]   experience, since it defined how to react to it, I didn't really launch it again, even
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.460]   though I'd had it in the back of my mind that, well, gee, I'd bet if I go downtown, I'll
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.460]   have a better--
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.500]   I think it probably would work downtown, yeah.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.940]   And the problem is you need to be able to edit and add these points.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.820]   And for some reason, the iPhone version doesn't let you.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:51.260]   They claim 80,000 downloads of the iPhone version, which is interesting.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.260]   That might--
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.260]   You should taper off.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.260]   That'll take about now.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   Slow down.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.500]   Good job for the first couple of weeks there, guys.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.500]   No, it's a awful stick.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.260]   Get a good real job.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.220]   Moving on to Chris Breen and our final pick of the week.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220]   Hey, Chris.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.220]   Hey.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.220]   Yeah, I have one, but I have to check this.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.220]   I didn't listen to last week's show.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.180]   But did anyone mention Radio Shift last week?
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.180]   No.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.220]   This is brand new, though, and I'm glad you're mentioning it.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.220]   This is from ROGA Meeba.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:24.140]   It's called Radio Shift, and the idea is it's Tivo for Radio S-word of kind of.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:31.100]   And it's a $32 program, and the idea is that you launch this thing, and it goes into a
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.700]   database of radio programs.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:37.460]   And this database is provided by a company called Radio Time, which had a Mac client last
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.460]   year.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:41.580]   I wrote about it a lot last year for Playlist because I liked it.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:44.700]   But they never really got a Mac client that was very stable.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.860]   So it was sort of useless.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.820]   And finally, it was a subscription service for $39 a year.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.820]   I liked it enough.
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:51.820]   I subscribed.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.020]   Then I got to notice a few months later saying, you know, we just--
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.140]   we're not keeping up with the Mac side of this thing at all.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.940]   So you can have your money back.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   Nice.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.940]   Well, that's nice.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.100]   Yeah, that was nice.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.740]   But ROGA Meeba then got into talks with these folks, and they said, you know, I think we
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.100]   can build an interface to this thing that is going to work out.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.300]   And the result was Radio Shift.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.220]   So you can go in and you can search for program by the call letters.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.260]   You can also search by content.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:22.660]   And it will pull up pages that will come up with various hits.
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:25.540]   So if you're looking for NPR stuff, for example, great.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.660]   It will do that.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.420]   But it will also find much more obscure stuff.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:32.300]   Anything that's basically being streamed over the web in real format or Windows Media
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.500]   or QuickTime, it will pick this up.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:39.940]   So I have a local station here that plays a program on the NPR station called Soul Shack.
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.140]   And it is the best two hours of soul music you've never heard.
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.180]   And unfortunately, it happens during time when I usually can't listen to it.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:52.500]   Well, now I've got Radio Shift set up so that it automatically records it at 192 kilobits
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:53.820]   per second, AAC.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:57.820]   And then it drops it into iTunes so that I can listen to that stuff later.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.140]   It also works with Griffin Technologies, RadioShark.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:04.940]   So if you're trying to record local programming, it will do the same thing there.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:10.260]   And again, Radio Shift is made by Rokamiba, the same people that bring you audio hijack
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.980]   and a station.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.180]   So yeah, they do good work.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:18.340]   I was really excited to see this thing come out because I do like radio time and the idea
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.460]   of being able to time shift radio.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:23.660]   One thing it doesn't do is you can't record live programming.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:28.180]   So I can listen to a program live, but there's no record button there.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:33.180]   And I've talked to Paul over at Rokamiba and he said, "Yeah, not in 1.0, but we're certainly
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.780]   looking at that kind of thing."
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:39.460]   And also more Teevo-like functions where you can be listening live and then you can go
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:43.220]   backwards in time or you can pause and then skip forward.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.420]   That's not there yet, but again, that's something they're looking at.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.500]   Would you do me a favor and search for Tech Guy in there?
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.500]   I just want to...
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.500]   We're in the data.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.500]   I bet we're not.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   I will look.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.500]   It's on my other computer.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500]   I bet you anything we're not.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.420]   But maybe I can urge Radio Shift.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.260]   Love, love, love, love that program.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.260]   Let me tell you how I found it.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.500]   I sent Paul the most angry, spittle-filled email, which I hope he understands.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.940]   Thankfully he understands the sarcastic.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940]   No.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:15.220]   Because I have a chapter in the new iPhone book about how to...
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.460]   The theme of the book is how to get anything and turn into a form that you can keep on
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.460]   your iPhone.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.700]   And one of them is here's how to get the streaming radio broadcast.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:27.980]   And so I've wrote the chapter about a month ago and so, okay, the final pass.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.300]   I've promised this to my editor today even though we're down to the wire.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:35.340]   Now I'm just going through, okay, Audio Hyjak Pro, $32.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.060]   I better double-check that price.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:43.020]   And then I hit the web page and see just 23 hours earlier, this awesome program got written.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:46.020]   Oh, really?
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.020]   But no public beta, no preview.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.020]   And I wrote it a letter.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.020]   I wrote it a email to Paul right away saying, "You son of a son."
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.020]   So you knew how busy I am.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.020]   You knew I've only had like one shower in the past four days.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.020]   I'm working on the book so much.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:01.020]   So this is the least you can do is send me a damn unlock code you bastard.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.020]   That's very funny.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.020]   Yeah, he got the...
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:07.020]   I sent the email at like, I don't know, like 12 o'clock.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.020]   I got an instant message from a friend of mine at 1202.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.020]   He's like, "Paul wants your home phone number, should I give it to him?"
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.020]   I thought we had a nice cover stage, but yeah, it's an awesome one.
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.020]   What I love most about it is that if you want, if you don't know what you're looking for,
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.020]   you can just throw up a map of the world.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:25.020]   And you can say, "Yeah, I wonder what's going on in Costa Rica?"
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   And there's some green dots over Costa Rica.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.020]   So you click on the dots and now you're looking at everything that's available in Costa Rica.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.020]   I love this.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.020]   I wasted so much time on this just looking for cool stuff.
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:39.020]   I mean, because on top of everything else, I'm a big addict of BBC streaming programming.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.020]   And just the ability to grab everything that I like from the BBC.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:49.020]   I used to do it with audio hijack, but the ability to simply search for when book at bedtime on.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.020]   Cool, just record it for me. Don't make me have to type numbers.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.020]   Yeah, that's... I mean, that's... I wonder how many shortwave radios are sold any more these days.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.020]   I mean, you can listen to everything on the internet with devices like this.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.020]   I mean, programs like this just makes it so easy.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.020]   I have to try it out. See if you can tape the tech guy with it.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.020]   That would be nice.
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.020]   All right, that is from erogomiba.com.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.020]   And that one is... How much is that? Did you say?
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.020]   $32.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.020]   $32.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.020]   Good price.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.020]   Well, thank you, everybody. I think we're going to bring back Mac wines in the next few weeks,
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020]   because we haven't done a wine in a while.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.020]   And...
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.020]   Actually, all we did was wine today.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:25.020]   Yeah, I guess we wine a little bit. We had a big wine fest.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.020]   I don't have my phone anymore. I don't have my software anymore.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.020]   You need it.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.020]   Andy and I...
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.020]   I'm going to...
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:35.020]   Is working on his new site, but until then, it's still at cwob.com.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.020]   And of course, you can catch him in the Chicago Sun times.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:41.020]   Regularly talking about all things tech.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.020]   Alex Lindsay is at the Pixelcore.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.020]   Pixelcore.com.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:49.020]   If you'd like to join the Pixelcore, it's a great troop, a guild, a multimedia artist who
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:52.020]   learn and get work together.
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:57.020]   Pixelcore.com and Pixelcore.tv is the home for all of their various productions.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.020]   Don't nundere call them podcast.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:04.020]   Scott Born has a few of those shows on his site.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:09.020]   It's applephoneshow.com, iLifeZo.com, pudango.com.
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:13.020]   And he's always a welcome and much beloved figure here.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:18.020]   I'll share this with you. I probably...
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:21.020]   I should ask you for permission, but Scott sent me a note after the last one saying,
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.020]   "Do you want me to quit this show? Do you want me to leave?"
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:26.020]   I said, "Scott, what are you talking about? What do we do without you?"
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.020]   You're the best part of the show. You're the fun part of the show.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.020]   So, no, we love someone.
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.020]   It's the 25 death threats every week that really...
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.020]   And pause.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:39.020]   So, Scott says, "I want to be known for something else. Have you picked something else?"
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:42.020]   Yeah, I'm going to start talking a little bit more about photography.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.020]   We're doing some photography. So, I mean, I'm still...
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.020]   Look, I can never shed the iPhone.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:52.020]   In fact, I just signed a deal with our good friend Andy's publisher,
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.020]   Wiley, to do an iPhone book on my own.
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.020]   Oh, great.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:21:00.020]   And so, I'll be talking about the iPhone in perpetuity, but I got another stuff.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:03.020]   You're a great photographer. And, you know, after Merlin's conversation last week
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.020]   about the 50 millimeter lens I went out and bought one,
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:08.020]   and I'd love to do more photography stuff.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:11.020]   Well, and we got a new site coming up called photo diary.com
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.020]   where we go on photo walks.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.020]   Oh, that's really tough fun.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.020]   And you can come with us if you want.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:17.020]   I would love to. I would love to.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.020]   Alex, you can come too.
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.020]   I'm coming.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.020]   We actually have...
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.020]   This show has more good photography.
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.020]   We should be talking about photography, not Max.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.020]   I mean, Andy's a great photographer. Alex is a great photographer.
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.020]   You're a great photographer.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.020]   I know Chris Breen's a great photographer.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.020]   So, next time we'll do more photography stuff.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.020]   Okay.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:37.020]   Photography of the air next week on Matt Breen's...
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.020]   More pictures.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.020]   Sort of red, and there's a duck in the foreground.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.020]   He's kind of out of focus.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:46.020]   Just, you know, look at Andy's diner photos, and you'll know what I'm talking about.
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:50.020]   Chris Breen is a part of the folk, the crew at Mac World Magazine.
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:55.020]   He does an Apple or Mac 911 column for people with Mac emergencies.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.020]   You can also read many of his books. Just go and go to the bookstore and say,
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.020]   "You got any of that stuff for that Breen fella?"
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.020]   Yeah, they'll point you to the shelf where they keep the Breen, the good stuff.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:08.020]   And of course, there's a regular on Apple Phone show, another podcast.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   And I'm proud to say it regularly now on Mac Breakwick. Thank you, Chris.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020]   Thanks very much, Leo.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.020]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   Here's to your brick.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:21.020]   I hope you, you know, send us your ideas, creative ideas for what to do with that brick, the iPhone.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.020]   And maybe you'll get that iPhone vest after all, Scott Horn.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.020]   OK, who knows?
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:29.020]   I'm Leo LaPorte. Thanks for joining us.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:31.020]   Another Mac Break is broke.
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:46.020]   [Music]
