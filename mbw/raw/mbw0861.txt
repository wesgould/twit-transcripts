[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.160]   He has a lovely piece in Macworld we'll talk about about the M3 processor.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.680]   He is also on the Mastodon. I'm happy to see it. Zeppelin.flights/ at Jason Snell.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.120]   Yes, indeed. The Mastodon. I have my own
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:17.520]   Air-
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.360]   Yeah, I have too cool for school, right?
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.680]   Too cool for Mastodon.social. I got my own.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.960]   Yeah, you got the real deal. I decided I was going to be there for a while. I had actually
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.780]   set that up back in 2018 and then taken it down. But in the
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.240]   metaverse, it just stayed as if it existed. It was a ghost Zeppelin.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.080]   Yeah. I just brought it back and figured I might as well park all of my professional stuff.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.160]   We launched social in 2019. It was me and another guy for three years.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   It was really cool. It was like five euros a month to Masto host to host it.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.160]   It was so little that I forgot I was paying for it. I thought it was free.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.400]   Because it was coming out of PayPal and I never even noticed.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.920]   And then all of a sudden, November 2022 happened.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.200]   And wow, it got quite quick.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.000]   There's more people now.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.800]   Now there's more people.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.720]   And the Enocho is also with us. GBH in Boston.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.560]   Enocho.com. Yeah, I'm on American Alliance Masto time since is that a bad?
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.360]   I think it's great. There's actually some cost me $30 a month.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   It's retro now. There's some real concern in the Fediverse, as we call it,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.600]   because Facebook has announced that it's going to in some way, we're not sure how it's
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.040]   integrate. And there are people in Mastodon who immediately said,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.800]   every every administrator should block all Facebook domains.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.240]   If they decide to join, block them. Because that's what the open free internet is all about.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.400]   Exactly. Hey, Mr. Alex Lindsey has his own assignment,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.320]   you know, which means he's probably at the White House or something, but knowing Alex,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.480]   but hey, we're glad to say Zach Holl is here from the estimable nine to five Mac
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.760]   and the nine to five Mac happy hour podcast.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.640]   And I'm glad you hear Zach because you're a musician. Clearly, you play the classical guitar.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.680]   Play the classical guitar. Have a lot of metadata involved with that.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:23.120]   Opus 43 G minor Zach Holl because we were just talking about last week.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.240]   I was pitching and moaning that. Last week Leo every week, every week,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.080]   every week since they killed prime.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.680]   Fonic and you have been there. We were the two prime.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.440]   Fun. Yes. And we were. Is that the classical up yet.com to be to be fair Jason. Like Apple
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.760]   was the parents who said that, well, we're not going to open our Christmas presents on December
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.000]   24th. We're going to wait till December 25th. And then we couldn't open them in January.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.720]   Then we couldn't open them in February. They were promising us something special and not giving it
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.840]   to us. Sure. So right after a show last week, they are going to finally launch Apple music
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.960]   classical, a standalone app available March 28th. Although now what I do every day is I wake up and
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.880]   I open the app to see if I have it because it could come earlier. I mean, you're able to download it
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:26.000]   as like a pre thing from the app store, but nothing has happened yet. Five million unique
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.560]   tracks, thousands of exclusive albums. And everybody everybody asks, well, why do you already have
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.680]   all these pieces in Apple music, don't you? And I don't know actually doesn't sounds like maybe
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.720]   there'll be more stuff than as an Apple music. But the real issue is, as you said, Zach metadata.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.080]   You said, I think last weekend, the best thing is going to be that you could say, I want to hear
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.840]   box be minor mass. And then you can see 20 different versions of it by different orchestras.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.120]   Yeah, because because some with with classical sometimes it's, I just want I just want to hear
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   the be minor mass or I want to why do you want to hear this recording? Is it because it's a box
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.600]   recording? Is it because it's this orchestra? Is it because it's this conductor? Is this because
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   it's the soloist? And it becomes really, really hard to really drill down on what you like or even
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.920]   or for the algorithm to figure out what is it that you like about this? I'm still I'm still
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.080]   in the Spotify hole where the fact that I listen to so much classical and opera,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.920]   it keeps giving me like, Hey, suggested albums. Here's a compilation of sweet sounds of the 60s.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   I get a lot of that music music to play paddle ball.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   Yeah. This is now unfortunately, Apple in the app store preview. And you can see you could pre
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.200]   order it doesn't have an iPad screenshot as far as I know that worries a little.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.720]   It seems like it's coming out for iPhone. It's not on the Mac and I can see it on my iPad too. So I
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.120]   suspect it'll run, but I think it's going to run in like the little iPhone window thing instead of
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:13.040]   hard apple apple. You had 18 months you're almost a $3 trillion company. You have
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.680]   billions in the bank and you can't get an iPad version of this.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.120]   Oh, also also remember that when they bought the when they bought the company to get classical,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.000]   that company had an Android app, but they're saying, Oh, we're going to be supporting Android
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.560]   real someday. Yeah. I mean, they could they could also have not like it is, at least they said they
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.800]   will support it. And quite frankly, they haven't said that about the iPad of the Mac. So I would
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   take it as a win Andy. It's it's better than radio. I'm not I'm not complaining. No, I'm not complaining.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.880]   Yeah. And one of the things that I liked about Prime Phonics, they had some really excellent,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.560]   believe it or not podcasts, excellent shows. Yeah. And I don't see those in this, but this is just
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.480]   screenshots that apples put up. So who knows what Apple will end up doing. Yeah, I mean,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.920]   one of the greatest one of the great things about Apple music when they launched was that they did
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.560]   have real human beings like curating and making recommendations and having their own shows
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.680]   just like the one of the great things about the app store is that they have editors who are
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.560]   not just going by metrics, they're simply saying, Hey, here are really here are eight really great
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.960]   apps that take take advantage of Apple pencil. I think a lot of us have worked with people who
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.320]   are now working at Apple and doing those editor things, whereas they used to do them at on websites.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.520]   So I'm hope I'm just hoping that they put the same amount of energy into this as they would
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.760]   any project that they actually take seriously. I hope it's not something where we've done it.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.600]   We acquired it because we needed every advantage we could possibly get against Spotify. But oh,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   gosh, we had to take some people off this project because of other priorities at the company.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.880]   That would kind of stink if it's kind of died on the vine. Even the desktop version of Apple music is
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.200]   I mean, it's a great Swift project if you're on at summer school learning how to program and
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.680]   program for Mac, but it's not really a great app. Yeah. Well, anyway, we'll find out maybe before
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.360]   March 28, but that's the official release date. And Zach, you didn't weigh in on this in any
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:21.520]   form or fashion. I have a few things in mind. Yes. Okay. So one, no iPad app. You can do the
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:28.080]   iPhone app on the iPad. It's nicer than ever with stage manager, the incredible multitasking feature.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.720]   You get your background. You can run it next to other apps, even though it's an iPhone app. So you
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:38.640]   could have like classical next to Instagram next to, you know, you name it and it'll all work together.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.080]   So maybe they're just giving up on iPad apps and this isn't the future. That would be bad.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.320]   The other thing is somehow I doubt that, but okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.000]   And a few other things. I know that a lot of the employees that were at Primphonic are on the
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.360]   music team or on the data. Are they that's actually good insight. So they kept the team
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.520]   and they're still there. That's a good sign. Right. Yeah. I would say like 75 or 80% of the people
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.360]   that were there are still there. I did a LinkedIn exploration one time and saw that.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.400]   And then last thing is with Primphonic, they would pay for the song based on
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:23.200]   minute played instead of stream played because you can have a three minute pop song and pay for
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.320]   the play, but you have a 30 minute or three hour classical performance. And see, pay for the minute.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   That was a big part of why Primphonic existed in the first place was to make that sustainable.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.600]   I guess with it being Apple, they don't have that problem, but I am curious how that if that
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.320]   changed or not with Apple because you'd imagine even though Apple can support the classical
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.480]   service on its own, subsidize it with Apple music and the iPhone, then you'd still want the artist
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.160]   behind the performance. I'll be watching Herbert von Carreon's Twitter account to see if he says
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.720]   anything about this. Because if he has a jewelry upgrade, it starts to start working around.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.960]   That's an excellent point because one of the things I do like about Apple music is that they pay
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:16.400]   creators a lot more than like YouTube plays, pays creators garbage. Right. Amazon too. But it's nice
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.960]   to know that not that streaming is helping to make up for the loss of album sales. But you'd
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:31.600]   like to think that they're being compensated as much as possible. There's more to this story
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.400]   than meets the eye. Thank you, Zach, for filling this. I'm glad you're here.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.800]   For those who are not super into classical music, Jesse Char who has worked at Apple and
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:53.280]   has a cellist and had a design company. She did a great Twitter thread that explains it in short
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.200]   detail of the challenges compared to the music app we just designed for Pop Music. So her example
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.280]   is you open the Nutcracker and literally you can't tell what the tracks are because the track
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.600]   names are so long. You can only see the beginning of it and you can't really see when it was
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.920]   composed and when it was recorded. The fundamental thing is Zach said metadata. Ironically, it's
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.800]   like the App Store. The App Store is a pop music service because they just took it from iTunes.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.880]   When you apply a pop music sensibility to other data sets, it doesn't always map very well.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.000]   Classical is just a great example where that interface doesn't work for classical music.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.120]   And so that's the reason there's a separate app and that's the reason why people like Leo and Andy
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:46.320]   and Zach are excited about this service because I don't know. I know how cranky Beethoven was.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.520]   I've seen it on the day. He loved and lost Jason already.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.200]   He did. He was just a very grumpy guy. And I recalled yesterday that when I was taking
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.320]   piano lessons as a kid, I would get little plastic blasts of classical composers as rewards for...
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.880]   So it's like, "Oh, you got show-pand this time." I'm like, "Oh, it's so great." So they're like
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.320]   Funko Pops except classical music. That's so hysterical. So anyway, there are lots of reasons why
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.160]   this makes sense and it being its own thing. And that's why people like Leo and Andy and Zach are
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.520]   excited about it. Yeah, there's a reason. Sorry, Ludwig.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   I'm so angry.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.320]   Oh, why?
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.360]   I'm so angry.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.600]   They, you know, well, you made a good point. Like I was getting Rock Me Amadeus every time I
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.760]   asked for Mozart. That's not what you want, right?
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.560]   That's what I want. I mean, Falco.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.200]   You want? Falco is a treasure.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.160]   I know.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.720]   Austria's treasure. You know, that's the first non-English
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.960]   song to hit number one in the US was Rock Me Amadeus before LaBamba and Despacito.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.640]   There came Rock Me Amadeus.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.160]   It was a wallbreaker, a ceiling...
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.960]   Falco.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.920]   Oh, yeah, he was.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   Oh, Falco, fella. Jesse
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.800]   said she hates the icon. So maybe they'll improve the icon.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.080]   She says that's a bad clef. She says that's a terrible, trouble clef.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.720]   It's awful. I think laughably bad.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.240]   I don't like white background icons and this has got a color background and there's even
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.200]   some difference in the...
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   A struggle.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.760]   A struggle.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.400]   Exactly.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   You can tell it's got to it.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.800]   On an Apple scale of icons, I think this is wonderful.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.640]   Okay. Yeah. I mean, I'm no magician.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.480]   Magician. So I don't know. And Jesse doesn't like it.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.080]   So that's, you know, she says, I'm not one to jump on the icon,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.560]   criticizing bandwagon. But this is actually like church choir, clip art,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.480]   bad and hilarious.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.920]   Well, it got approved.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   Okay, fine.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.040]   Okay, fine.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.240]   I love that everybody is an legitimate expert and can give you informed opinions on something
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.200]   that you just absolutely did not notice. And I'm not being sarcastic at all.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.240]   I'm saying that there are people who absolutely know what they're talking about.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   This is their area of expertise. And then you suddenly, well, damn it.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.560]   I didn't think that was horrible, but now I kind of smell so forever.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.480]   She tweets, I'm a classically trained,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.320]   cellistic composer, former Apple employee and CEO of a design studio that specialized
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.720]   in icon and UI design. So I, yeah, I think she has standing on this.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.800]   Yeah. It's it's it's thick in areas. It shouldn't be in the actual icon itself is pretty elegant.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.480]   So they took some liberty.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.120]   This is a good sick burn. She says, it's the musical equivalent of curls,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.800]   the font curls. It's technically legible. It just looks extremely goofy.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:51.040]   It's just it's the wrong, the wrong message to be sending. So curl stands, I think, is what
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.400]   we're looking for. Curls, sands. Yeah.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.520]   Is there a girl's sands? I don't know how you would do that.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:04.560]   Curls all about the serifs. All right. Enough of that. That's a silly story, a light story.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.360]   But I just wanted to take a little victory lap. Andy and I are very happy about that.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:15.600]   Look forward to it. Yeah. Can't wait. And maybe more people will listen to classical music because
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.800]   of it. I don't know. And the discord chat is telling us that some people like that treble clef.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   Here comes treble in the words of that is what modern family guy.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.080]   Modern family. Yeah. I just did a jeopardy thing out of that.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.480]   Modern family guy. All right. Moving on to the real story, the big story, which I am
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:52.240]   very interested to get your opinions on this. Who was it? Who was it? Had the story initially
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:17:06.560]   that it was Tim Cook's decision to override the engineers and the design team and release the
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:15.360]   Apple VR goggles this year. Jeff Williams, the COO apparently said, no, we want it out. The
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.240]   design team and the engineer said it's not it's not ready. It's not ready. We don't let's wait till
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.880]   we have the real deal, the AR thing. And then Tim weighs in and says we're going to we're going
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.600]   to release it. Is that you think an accurate assessment of what really happened? This I'll give
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:41.440]   credit to the financial times who had this. Oh, yeah, it was the FT. Yeah. So what the FT says is that
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:49.280]   the design team told the executives that they shouldn't release a mixed reality product at all
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:56.640]   and wait for the lightweight imaginary glasses that don't exist and won't exist for many years
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.280]   and only ship that. So that that was apparently their story. This is a real, you know, again,
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.120]   there are degrees here, but that one just blew me away because that was like, come on, they're
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.200]   not living in reality. Like they're literally just just no, no, let's just wait and not ship
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.920]   anything in this category for many years and then we'll invent something new and then we'll ship
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.240]   that and it'll be great. Whereas I think that Apple is very much on the tack that they have to
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.160]   start shipping something and there is a bar that they have to clear, but you have to ship something
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.640]   that's viable that you can also start to iterate on in public, right? You can't just keep it on the
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.880]   inside. It's going to be flawed. It's going to have issues and they're going to get that feedback
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.480]   and then they're going to work on it out in the open, but you got to ship something at some point.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.200]   So the idea, like I would take it with more credence if it was like, look, it's been delayed
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.800]   several times. Clearly, there have been lots of times where they've gotten to the point of like,
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.400]   should we ship this and they're like, no, no, no. And Mark Gurman keeps on reporting like, well,
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.000]   they wanted to do it last year, but they're pushing it back. Well, they wanted to do it this fall,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.520]   but it's going to be the spring. Well, they wanted to do it in the spring, but now it's going to be
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:03.280]   the summer at WWDC. So that process is happening. But the fact that there are apparently former
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.840]   designers who are now belly-aching to the financial times, they shouldn't ship that
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.960]   product at all and should just sit on the sidelines, which strikes me as just being, I mean, that's
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.280]   the kind of thing if you're the CEO or the or the COO, you say, no.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.480]   Let me let me read to you a little bit from the FT story, Patrick McGee and Tim Bradshaw writing.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:34.400]   Apple's operation team wanted to ship a version one product, a ski goggle-like headset that will
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:40.240]   allow users to watch a immersive 3D video, perform interactive workouts or chat with realistic avatars
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.080]   through a revamped FaceTime. But Apple's famed industrial design team had cautioned patients,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.920]   wanting to delay until a more lightweight version of AR glasses became technically feasible.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.120]   Most in the tech industry expect that to take several more years and deciding to press ahead
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.840]   with a debut this year, Cook has sided with operations chief Jeff Williams, according to two
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:07.200]   people familiar with Apple's decision making and overruled the early objections from Apple's
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.000]   designers to wait for the tech to catch up with their vision. Does this comport with what you're
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.480]   hearing, Zach? There's a few things that this made me think about. One is the narrative that
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:26.320]   is being pushed. That operations is overpowering design and that do you really want your operations
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.080]   team designing products when you've got a design team for that, especially to Apple.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.600]   I think something that's important here is that the operations team, you can call it that,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.520]   but it's really the executive level. It's Tim Cook, who comes from operations and Jeff Williams,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:44.000]   who is operations, but he's also a lot of other things. The top executive is making the decisions,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.560]   not just letting the design teams dictate what's going to happen. Another thing is the article
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.800]   framed this as the first thing from Tim Cook, a meeting AirPods, saying that the Apple Watch
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.200]   was a Steve Jobs product. I'm not sure to what extent history says about that. I'm curious what
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.920]   you think about that, Snow. Then the other thing to make a point that Apple did not replace Johnny
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.280]   Iva is the chief design officer. I wanted to say that Apple's not, they don't care about
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.080]   design as much because they didn't replace that role that was. In reality, made up to satisfy him
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.680]   for a few years. Then he was the first, he was the last. They could have mentioned that the actual
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.600]   hardware lead for design is leaving with no replacement, but they didn't mention that.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.080]   I like both of the pores. I respect both of them. I think there's a story here, but there were some
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.040]   things that if you just know Apple, you're pretty good about it, then you'd see as red flags about
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:44.240]   the general story. That was kind of the source. The real thrust of it wasn't so much that they're
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.800]   going to release these headsets, which we knew. But that design, which had previously really ruled
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:57.760]   the roost at Apple, even before Johnny was made the chief design officer, Johnny Iva and Steve Jobs
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.960]   certainly were the two power tent poles at Apple. Their point is now Iva is leaving
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:13.520]   and they haven't replaced the chief design officer as you say, a new position, so not a surprise.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.800]   It sounds like they're saying, the FT is saying, yeah, this is a big power shift at Apple, but you
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:26.080]   don't think that's the case. This is the same narrative as Trip Knickill's book, Apple, after Steve.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.320]   And I strongly suspect a lot of the same sources involved, which is sources who are people who
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.880]   used to work in that group with Johnny Iva and aren't at Apple anymore, and they want to paint
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.440]   a narrative that everything they did was in the right. And now Apple has gone in the wrong direction
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.400]   because nobody's listening to the designers. And Zach makes an excellent point like, wait a second,
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.080]   the Apple Watch, when it was released, was being accused of not having that Steve Jobs magic,
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.440]   because it was such a Tim Cook product. And now suddenly it's at Steve Jobs product and Johnny
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.960]   Iva product. And Tim Cook doesn't get any credit for that. He will give him AirPods maybe, but
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:09.040]   I don't know. I mean, everybody's going to have their own bias when they're relying on these
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   sources. And I get the same smell from this story as I did from the Trip Knickill book, which is
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.680]   that he got a lot of people who have left the company from Johnny Iva's design group to talk.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.760]   And there weren't necessarily the other side of it would be people who maybe are still at Apple
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.080]   and aren't going to talk to him about it. And so you end up with this narrative that is a really
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.360]   easy, fun, broad narrative, which is Apple used to be a design focus company. And now they're run
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.520]   by engineers or they're run by bean counters. And while there is, I think at its core, some truth
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.040]   to that, I think that's a lot of these stories just completely blow it out of the water and
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.680]   overplay it. And that's why that moment where they're like, we don't even think they should
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:55.200]   ship a VR product and they should just wait for that AR product. Again, to be clear, that technology
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.960]   has to be invented. It doesn't exist to make a spectacular thing that you can wear like a pair
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.680]   of glasses that does augmented reality at a very high level. Like that product doesn't exist.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.080]   It's not going to exist for years. People have to invent and advance the tech to get there, right?
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.800]   And so for them to say, let's just sit on the sidelines and not ship a product. It's a
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.280]   bizarre, it's a bizarre report, honestly. And it's the kind of thing you get from,
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.720]   I think, a bunch of people who have sour grapes and have left Apple and think that as most people
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.760]   do when they leave a job, it hasn't been as good since I left. It just hasn't.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.880]   - Although it does bring up some interesting questions, though. The Apple Watch and the iPhone
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.240]   are two interesting examples of products that you could argue weren't ready, but they shipped
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.000]   anyway because the moment was right. Famously, I think the Apple Watch, they just had to put it
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.520]   out there. They had to, they had, they could design a really cool looking fashion watch.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.600]   They decided that, hey, let's demo it by telling people that you could
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   not only open up your garage door from your watch, but you could watch live video of your garage
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.680]   door opening. That was the big demo that was going to get people to fork over $12,000 for a solid
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.400]   gold gadget watch. It took a while for them to realize that, okay, this is a fitness watch
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.760]   that also has really good phone features, but we're going to sell this as a fitness device.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.600]   The iPhone also, a 2G phone that doesn't do cut and paste, doesn't have apps in a world
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.320]   in which every phone, the best phones have 3G. All of them could do cut and paste.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.960]   All of them had app stores or ways to side loads apps on them. There is an interesting
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:37.360]   metric here where Apple also here has a product where there is not even something to copy from.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.240]   There is no successful version of this product unless you want to, unless you want to count
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.360]   a game headsets, which you could definitely do, but I don't think Apple is interested in
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.160]   creating a $3,000 product that's just for watching movies and playing, and playing really cool
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.480]   lightsaber games on. And so there is, there is the argument to be, to be made of what point do we
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:04.080]   say that the time is not right. We, the ground has not been, we need to, we need to spend a couple
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.800]   years preparing the ground to plant this seed before we can actually do anything with it.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.200]   But I do think that it's a good idea to create, create low expectations, say,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.400]   if they announced this by saying that this is not a consumer product yet, this is just for
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.640]   developers and our partners who are going to need some time to get their, to wrap their
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.320]   head around the idea of a virtual reality app, so to speak, so that you can hit the ground running,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.560]   get a great piece of hardware. And if you're, if you're in enterprise, if, and you want to create
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.280]   custom apps specifically for your business, we would love for you to use our $3,000 goggles to do
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.440]   that. They're going to have to start sometimes. So long as they don't say we're, as long as it's
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:50.400]   as long as Tim doesn't come out and say, we're here to change the world. We think that the intersection
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:56.000]   of humanity is, no, no, you're creating a $3,000 thing for people looking for a $3,000 thing and
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.200]   want to develop the first generation of things for the $3,000 thing. That would be a success.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.760]   John Gruber on there in Fireball also points out that the financial times left out the 1000
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.720]   person strong AR/VR team under Mike Rockwell, who might have an opinion on this. And Greg
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:23.360]   Jazooay X product marketing division. And so the real question, in my mind, yeah, I understand
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:31.040]   these designers, you know, who don't work there anymore, have an opinion. Maybe they would say,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.800]   I'll defend them. Maybe they would say, well, we don't want Apple to release a dead on arrival
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.840]   product, especially at $3,000. And I have to say that is a legitimate concern, isn't it? I mean,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.560]   VR is not exactly taken the world by storm.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.680]   It is well, I mean, it is a legitimate concern. I think I would say that from the designer's
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   perspective, you know, obviously there's the conversation about the VR product and then there's
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.720]   the conversation about the AR product. And the FT's report says that they specifically said just
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:06.000]   don't make a VR product, which is, I mean, that's a take, right? But I think if you're,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.280]   if you're any other part of Apple, the way that they viewed this category is that if they if they
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.000]   want believe that an AR product is going to be the future, they have to start iterating on this
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.960]   technology and get it going. And that they think that there's enough in the VR product to make it
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.640]   viable. Now, again, they'll do that in secret, right? Normally, Apple, I mean, the car to a point,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.200]   they're they're going to go. Yeah, they're going to get to as far as long as they can without releasing
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.560]   a dud product. I mean, they don't want to Google glass on their hands.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.360]   They don't right, but I think they may look at AR and say that is where we want to go. And we
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.120]   can't just start with AR, we have to start now and we have to start inventing this stuff and getting
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.640]   the software to be better. I think Andy made the great point, like, is it going to be there? I
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.080]   think their greatest risk right now is that they've got a product that isn't going to appeal to
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.120]   almost anybody. And if it's going to cost what it does, and that they're going to have to spin
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.200]   that in a certain way, and I'm not sure Apple's ego will allow them to spin it in that way. And
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.120]   then that's when you say this will change the world and we are going to market it to people.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.920]   And then they're going to get the sticker shock of actual price. And there's a risk that people
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.320]   go, well, that's Apple. There's their entry. And there's no chance for the AR. And I think Andy,
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.360]   you and I, as we've talked about these AR spectacles, are very much in favor of them. But that's a
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:31.040]   very different thing from VR goggles. And far away, and far away, and not even technology doesn't
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:38.480]   even exist yet. Yeah. Yeah. As Jason said, just the technology for combining real your actual
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.920]   vision with an overlaid graphic, there is not even yet a component maker who can deliver that.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.920]   Their best that we can get is that you can get a little you can get a little Google Glass sort of
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.880]   thing where you can get an overlay of monochrome, basically text, which is not useless. That could
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:01.360]   be a very, very useful thing to put into pair of glasses. But even then you have the problem of,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.800]   okay, now it's going to be great. So long as you're only inside, what if you go outside on a cloudy
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.680]   day in late afternoon, where there's very little sunlight outside and suddenly nothing works.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:18.240]   And even it works perfectly. Have fun with your 100 degree field of vision, where as soon as you
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.720]   turn your head, like it has to keep up with you because there is no peripheral vision whatsoever.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.480]   This is by this is nowhere near a solved problem. So this is one of the reasons why I'm kind of
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.960]   encouraged by Apple saying, let's make what we can make now. Let's not plan for something that we
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   don't even know can exist for another five years yet. You can do virtual reality because you can't
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:46.320]   have a fully immersive, goggle experience. I think that the only thing that will constitute a failure
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.200]   for me with Apple is if they did manage to have a successful product, but everybody agrees. The
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:58.080]   only reason why they sold out even their short million unit run was because it had an Apple logo
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.680]   on it, it had a certain cache about it. There were a lot of people who wanted to be the first to
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.200]   have these things. But when push come to shove, just like Google Glass, after initial few weeks of
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.400]   excitement, it winds up being in a drawer. That would be a massive failure for Apple.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.560]   Gruber points out that the Financial Times chief argument, which is that Tim Cook is forcing this
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:25.680]   to seal his legacy is actually completely wrong. Tim Cook's legacy is intact. And actually,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:35.040]   this is a risky thing to do. This could be the Newton to a capper to his tenure as CEO, not
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:42.880]   the iPhone. So Zach, are you going to spend three grand and run out and buy a lovely
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.360]   Apple mixed reality? They're calling it mixed reality, by the way. But let's just face it.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.680]   It's VR. Yeah. I hope someone spends the three grand on my behalf.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:32:00.240]   You're not dying for one, huh? Do you do any VR at all? I've done PlayStation VR.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.720]   And that's the extent of my VR. I guess, unless Google cardboard, I've done that as well,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.640]   which is more economical. There you go. There you go. That was a great idea. Yeah.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.000]   Yeah. Yeah. That was good. Good.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.200]   The bottom line on the FC article for me is that at least Johnny Iver, people close to him
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.440]   there. And they're not there anymore. Don't want their name on the product. They don't want to
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.360]   take credit for it. They're not. We understand that. And then there's something I'd rather take credit
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.120]   for the thinnest, lightest keyboard Apple's ever made, the fabulous butterfly keyboard.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.840]   That's my legacy, says Johnny Iver. I mean, there's no question that the design team has taken some
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:42.480]   bad turns under Johnny Iver. Right. I mean, as a static object, that is a beautiful keyboard.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   That's something you simply regard from a distance. That is an achievement.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.160]   Or using a completely spotless, clean white blue.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.880]   No white room. Yes. We're Johnny Litz. Yeah. Yeah. I have, by the way, thanks to Mark
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:02.560]   40 sent me even more of Johnny's red noses. So John, this is Johnny, you should never have
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:08.080]   released the red nose. It wasn't ready. I'm telling you that aluminium is really rough on the skin.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:14.400]   This is also powder powder powder. There's definitely a you're reaping what you so kind of
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.360]   thing happening here, which is when Steve Jobs died, Apple was really, really concerned about
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:26.240]   maintaining a view from the outside of stability and that Apple would continue to be great. And Johnny,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.160]   you know, Johnny was burned out. We all know that we've read all the books about it. Johnny
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.800]   basically was done and they paid him a lot of money and gave him an exalted title and put him
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.320]   in charge of anything that he wanted to cars, software, you name it, because for a while after
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:47.040]   Steve Jobs died, they wanted to project stability. And then after that time passed, they were able
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.560]   to disengage from Johnny Ivan, let him go on his way. And you know, it's the long goodbye, right,
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.400]   where it was first he's a consultant. He's not doing much consulting and they're not listening to him,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.040]   but he still we're paying him and we'll say he's there. And then finally he goes away. So like,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.320]   this is the, this is the reaping of that, which is now you've got people on Johnny's team and the
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.000]   design team who are like, aha, you didn't listen to us. But you know, I think it was a good idea for
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.720]   Apple in that period to build him up in order to reassure people on the outside. But you know,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.040]   now they have to pay for it when the designers throw rocks at them.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:27.280]   And I have to, as long as we're excoriating the financial times, I really have to take issue,
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   Umbridge, if you will, with this egregious chart, Jason, Jason, you should have added
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:39.360]   and would have added some colors to this chart. This thing is horrific. First of all, three shades
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:47.200]   of blue. What the hell? And then I don't even understand what this is. It's just all mishmosh
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   together. It's a gist is that subsequent versions of iPhone, Apple Watch and iPod have done better
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.760]   than the original versions, but it's hard to tell that you really have to get better as they go. I
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.680]   see. Yeah. And I have a point on that too, which is if you look at that chart, the newer
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.080]   iPhone does better than the earlier ones. That's awesome. On the headset, it won't be that way,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.320]   because with the phone, last year's gets replaced with this year's, which is about the same price,
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.240]   and it does even more. With the headset, we're not going to see a $3,000 version this year,
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.040]   and then next year's see an even better $3,000 version. We're going to see a more affordable version
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.440]   than the $3,000 one that doesn't do you play as much? Just, you know, makes some decisions that
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:33.120]   makes it not as expensive, but we're not going to see headset two replace headset one.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.160]   That's a good point. In the same way that we do with watch and iPhone.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:41.200]   Yeah. So there won't be that growth. It'll just be one seller and then nothing.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.360]   Right. So it'll be cheaper. But yeah.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   You know what, Zach, I'm with you. If somebody else buys me that headset,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:55.760]   but I, you know, because I have to figure out, because nobody's going to buy it for me,
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:02.640]   I have to really figure out whether I should buy a $3,000 VR headset. I foolishly last year
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:08.160]   bought the Oculus Pro that Facebook put out for $1,600. And I've, and I had to,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.280]   I felt like I was wearing the sucker hat the whole time. I think I might not buy this,
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.640]   but we have to. Jason, well, you'll get a review unit. That'll suck.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.160]   That might, yeah. Let's like, yeah. Yeah.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.040]   More on review unit. Bring it in, baby, because otherwise I got to pay for it out of my own pocket.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.160]   Yeah, because we have to take the yellow one.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's, and the truth is, if you're in this business, like,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.880]   the truth is, if that's the only way I can get one and write about it, I will spend $2,000 on it.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.400]   But again, I'm not a good model because this is what I do professionally. I'm not the,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:46.240]   don't be like me kids. I am tired. I really wonder, I don't know if developers are going to be so
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.360]   all in on this concept that they're going to spend three grand to develop something for a
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.040]   dudgy audience. For a tiny audience of people who would buy the $3,000 product. That's the thing,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.320]   developers, honestly, a developer will spend $3,000 on an expensive developer kit of a brand new
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.000]   Apple platform that they think has potential. The problem is what's the potential market?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.880]   And that's where it comes back to Andy, saying, oh, with a $3,000, we're changing the world.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.080]   And the developers are like, guys, you got to make a version that sells millions and millions of
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.880]   units. Otherwise, why am I putting in my time here? And that is the, that's the real question,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   is how they frame that. Because all the reports say that, you know, in a year, there'll be a
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.840]   cheaper version. But that's a long time to wait if you're a developer waiting for revenue to come
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.360]   in from this platform. And did you want to be our Jim Kramer and say, it's a, it's a no buy.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.960]   I don't know. Is it guaranteed to be the wrong advice? Because that's
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.760]   Jim Kramer, the guy who's selling you to buy Silicon Valley bank.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.440]   Those are in Valley Bank two weeks ago. Oh boy, opportunity, opportunity. Yeah.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.880]   It's, yeah, again, I think, I think that a lot of people who, who are really motivated to have
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.600]   it are going to have a good time with it. Because there are some of them. I, I, I'm always here to
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.320]   defend Google Glass because I always liked the way that Google proposed it. They said that this
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.160]   is an experiment where not only that, but something very, very clever that I'm sure was based on the
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.760]   rate at which they can manufacture them. But I think it's something that Apple could copy.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.840]   They were like, no, here's, there's not an ordering page, you'll get it in two to four weeks. It's
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.840]   like, no, there is a, we're open, we have, we're opening up another thousand buying slots. And
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.760]   if you basically said that, no, this is not something you go into the Apple store and you even try out.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:36.080]   It is, we have another 10,000 that are ready to go. And maybe, and tell it, and at least fill out
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.960]   a form to tell us why you think you need one of the, you need one of these units. And even if it's
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.800]   even, oddly enough, even if it's just BS, even if they're not actually looking at these things and
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.280]   actually pass failing people, if it really is something where, no, it's not something that the
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.800]   general public is being encouraged to buy, that is something good. Remember Google Glass, they
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:01.440]   was always framed as an experiment. They spent the entire demo after the sky, after the skydiving,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.920]   live skydiving video streaming via Google chat, they were saying that we, they were saying that
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.080]   we don't understand what wearables, how wearables are going to fit in. We don't understand how
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.800]   the general public is going to react to wearables. And we, and by that, we don't just mean the people
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.560]   who wear them, but the people who interact with those who wear them. So therefore, as an experiment,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.640]   where you were putting this out to collect data on this sort of stuff, and we fill as a
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.720]   we'll learn a lot by that. So that's why I don't, that's why I'm hesitant to call it a failure,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.880]   because I don't think they ever really made it, they really presented it as a commercial product.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.480]   If Apple does the same thing with this first iteration of their goggles, I think that that
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.400]   will set them up for greater success later on. And yes, I will, I will, I will disagree with you
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:52.160]   on that. Google Glass damaged Google's reputation and killed that. I think people understood it.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:58.240]   Yeah. I mean, Robert Scoble taking a shower with it. It was, it was a nightmare all around for
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.800]   Google. And I don't think anybody at Google would characterize glass as well. No harm, no foul.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.680]   It was not a good thing. Well, no, at least at least they did the right thing. But and by the way,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.640]   I loved my Google Glass. I think, I think that if they, if all they did, if all they did was remove
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:18.400]   the camera and simply say, here is just simply a heads up display that that response to voice
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.600]   commands. I think that would have been a completely different story. Yeah. And had it been accepted,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.440]   and had Robert Scoble not showered with it, maybe they would have released version two. Well,
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.000]   not, but they did not only, not only that, but let's say, but how about if Robert Scoble, like,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.040]   if given, if given like the first position in line for Q&A with Larry Page, say, Hi,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.680]   I'm one of the original glass holes, like, oh, let's let's also give Google some credit here
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:49.280]   for the death of glass, because Google is famously a company that just abandons things. Yeah, right,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.640]   when they when there's the first whiff of stink, they just are out of there. And I would say,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:01.440]   Apple shipping this product, assuming they do it, I think they're committed, right? Like, I think
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.920]   if they ship it, they are committed to having this platform for for a long time. It might be the
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.640]   first thing since the new, the Apple socks. Yeah, but this is a platform Leo. This would be like
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.840]   the Newton, you'd have to go back to the Newton for this, right? And if if it is that big a flop,
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.480]   then I mean, there'll be a legacy for Tim Cook, but I think Apple has so much money,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.160]   they can afford to iterate on this for a long time. So the alternative is Google, like,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.880]   Google Glass didn't get laughed out of the market. It got laughed at, and then Google just dropped
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.280]   it like a hot rock, like every other project that Google drops. Yeah, we don't know what the
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.880]   real, you know, I have to say, you'd be nuts to pay 3000 for this in June when it's announced.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:48.720]   Wait six months, it'll be 2000, right? I mean, or buying on eBay after the after all,
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.880]   after everyone who bought it just for review as an out desperate to free up that capital for
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.040]   other things I need to write about. Here's the problem. What do they do next year? Do they do
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.760]   something next year that's a consumer? That's what the rumor says, right? All the all the reports
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.600]   are that this is Apple reality pro and that's going to be their high end model and that there
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.720]   will be a consumer-ish model. Although we say consumer model, but when the high end is three grand,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.320]   the consumer model might still be more than a thousand dollars. We don't know.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.760]   Like, where is that bar? And that again, if I was a developer thinking about investing in this
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.840]   platform that is going to be very different than all of Apple's other platforms, I would have
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.080]   questions about like, will this ever be a high volume product in the next two or three years?
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.320]   Or is this Apple saying like, oh, no, but in 10 years, it's going to be great because I can't,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.000]   you know, feed myself on sales from 10 years from now if I'm a developer.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Yeah. And realize that app store fortunes are made with in-app purchases on games. They're not
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.520]   people who are buying on the outliner by subscription. And so that's going to be a sticking point.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.960]   But if this is also going to be an experiment for them to realize that this is the, if this is the
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.600]   pitch to the angels version of it where we're not going to care about how much this costs,
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.400]   we're going to be pitching this as a developer edition as a first generation thing. It could be
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.640]   that one of the things, most important things they learn in the first year is that, okay, we thought
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.360]   you needed 19 cameras. It turns out that only six of them are giving us data that's really
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:25.600]   significant. We thought we needed 320 frames per second. Actually, 240 is just fine. And when
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.080]   you realize that there is absolutely no way in hell, even with the greatest app that has totally
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.200]   changed the world and caused dogs and cast to love one another as God intended them to,
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.480]   people are not wearing this for more than two and a half hours for love or money.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.520]   Okay, so now it's all the slick things that we did to make sure that you'd be able to wear this
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.720]   for six hours. That's not relevant terribly relevant either. And then finally, you get to the point
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:58.320]   where people are willing to, people who would be bokeying at a $600 Oculus set might say that,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.200]   well, look, this is an Apple product. I'll pay $800 for it. I'll pay $1,000 for it. Not just for
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.080]   the Apple tax, but because I'm used to spend, I've been conditioned to spend a little more for that.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.600]   It is desirable to me and it's worth the extra money. I want to take a little break.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.400]   Anything could happen when we come back, though, I'm going to ask all three of you
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:23.280]   your predictions for this. But I also want to give a little shout out to Jason Snell,
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:29.840]   who after last week's episode went out, found yellow everything and made a video
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.520]   yellow iPhone. I had to. I wish I had a banana and a lemon in my house.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.480]   The yellow is video I've ever, ever seen. You're not adjust yourself.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:45.440]   Yeah. I mean, really, because what else was there to talk about Leo? It's just a yellow
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:51.680]   iPhone. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's yellow iPhone with tennis ball and, you know,
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.560]   where'd you get the barrel of monkeys? I've had that since I worked at Backworld. I've had a
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.840]   barrel of monkeys barrel and a day it's yellow. So it's like, yo, you win. You're yellow. You get
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.480]   to be in this video. You've had everything yellow, including a hat shot shirt. Well done.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.920]   In depth. And I did. I did some ratings. If you haven't seen the video, I did some ratings of
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.160]   yellow. I talked about his pros and its cons. I think I gave it four out of five, maybe three
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:19.360]   out of five. Like it's a good color, but it's not like orange. It's not that good. So like,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.640]   it slides. It's versatile because like the banana and the lemon tastes nothing alike. So obviously,
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.680]   yellow has got some versatility. But you know, again, very nice. What else am I going to say?
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.160]   Very nice. You did a great job doubling down on the yellow.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.600]   We'll have more with our special guest from nine to five Mac, Zach Hall, Jason Snell,
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:52.160]   Andy Anacoba. First word from our sponsor. Express VPN. Using the internet without Express VPN is
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.440]   like one of those people on an airplane, you know, on the cell phone call talking, real loud it.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:06.880]   It's a get right. Sell that S V B sell sell. It's it's not exactly private. And everybody in the plane
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:14.000]   can hear everything you're saying when you're not using a VPN, your internet service provider,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.440]   as somebody sitting on your Wi-Fi network can see what you're doing your most private sensitive
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.880]   information. So don't be that person on the plane yelling into the phone. Use Express VPN.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.680]   Now I'll tell you, there are three reasons people choose a VPN security. Of course,
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.840]   privacy is another one and the ability to watch shows anywhere in the world, you know,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:44.240]   to eliminate geographic restrictions. That's great. But it's important to understand you've
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.400]   got to choose the right VPN. And this is where people often go wrong. They say, well, I'm going
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:55.440]   to choose it by price. And the free VPN. Well, let me put it this way. If you are not the customer,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:01.040]   then you're the product. And if you're not paying for it, your privacy is just as at risk on a free
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.280]   VPN. Express VPN does it differently. First of all, it's not super expensive. I'm going to tell
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.800]   you get for less than seven bucks a month. But that money is well spent. They do a number of things
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:17.840]   to make your VPN better. First of all, privacy. They run something called trusted server. And
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.480]   this has been audited by the third party. In fact, there was a great article in Bleeping Computer
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.880]   about how Express VPN works that was fantastic, independent review. Their trusted server technology
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.000]   runs in RAM only. They wrote it specifically for this and is sandboxed. You can't write to the
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.440]   hard drive. So when you push that button on your Express VPN app on iOS or Android or Mac or Windows
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.440]   or Linux or on your router, you're spinning up your personal instance of the trusted server.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.640]   No one else is using it. And then when you're when you hang up, when you're done, when you turn
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   off the VPN, it goes away. And no trace of your visit remains. And if that weren't enough,
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.000]   they also use a custom Debian distribution for all their servers that wipes itself every single
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.920]   day. They complete fresh start. So their servers have no information. They save no information
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.440]   about your usage. I think that's really, really important. In fact, if you even want to be more
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.240]   anonymous, they take crypto for payment. So you can, I mean, you can really protect your privacy
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:25.200]   with Express VPN. And secure absolutely. They they they have written the best trusted VPN servers
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:33.440]   out there that they're widely used by others. And and and their privacy policy been vetted by
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.720]   third parties is continuously vetted by third parties. And and can you can be reassured they
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:44.960]   follow it exactly. Number one rated by the Verge by Business Insider is the only VPN I use is the
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:51.200]   only one I recommend Express VPN. Now I said I was going to get you a good deal. You could secure
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.160]   your online activity today by going to Express VPN dot com slash Mac break. When you sign up for
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.040]   one year package, you're gonna get three months free. That's a big discount. Gets it down to below
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:07.520]   seven bucks a month Express VPN dot com slash Mac break runs everywhere. You can actually they
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.200]   have they sell routers or you could put it on their number of routers. You can see at the website
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.960]   that you could put it on. So your whole house could be protected. And it's so fast you won't know
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.400]   you're running VPN. Oh, that's the other reason you want one that there's actually other reasons
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.440]   you might want to get a paid VPN. One is they buy enough bandwidth for all their servers so you
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:29.120]   don't feel like you're slowed down bogged down to they rotate their IP addresses. So it so,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:35.360]   you know, you're coming from anonymous IP address that's changed constantly. Express VPN dot com
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:41.760]   slash Mac break. That's the URL to get three months free with a one year package Express VPN.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:51.440]   Don't make me spell VPN. Expr ESS VPN dot com slash Mac break. These are the guys.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.240]   And we think of so much for support Mac break. You support it right back when you use that address
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:07.360]   Express VPN dot com slash Mac break. So I think it's legitimate for anybody working for Apple to
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:13.280]   raise their hand and say, you know, I understand we spend a lot of money developing this product.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.240]   When we thought of it several years ago, just like when Mark Zuckerberg started calling
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:26.880]   Facebook meta, it seemed like a good idea. But it's it's not it's obvious. Nobody wants these
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:34.080]   things they make 11% of the population nauseated in the first 10 minutes. Maybe this is a bad idea.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:40.560]   Jason, you think Apple should or should not do this? Well, if I'm Tim Cook, I say,
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:48.320]   I hear your point there. But this is Tim. I hear your point. But we also have 120 or whatever
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:53.040]   billion dollars in cash in the bank. And then my number one goal is the CEO is to make sure that
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.160]   the iPhone is never replaced by some other technology. And I feel like AR glasses are the
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.120]   one thing that could maybe do that. And I can spend a few billion in over the next 10 years
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:08.320]   every year in order to reassure that if there if they are glasses or everything, we're there with
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.760]   the best product in that category. But is this necessary to develop the AR glasses?
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:17.200]   We start. You think this is? I think it is because I think yeah, I think it is because they have to
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:23.520]   the system. I have to we have to get the software out there. We have to understand what users issues
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:29.440]   are. We need to start building our our reality operating system now so that when we get and so
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.920]   that we can start developing the technology that is going to get us to that future because I believe
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.640]   if I'm Tim Cook that I can I can lead us there. I think that that would be their argument.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:46.320]   If you're asking for my prediction, my prediction is that this one will be have very limited sales
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.440]   that they will probably cut its price that they will say no, no, no, next year is the real one.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.920]   And that in the end, in like two or three years, they will find some niches where people really love
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:02.560]   it. But it will not be a broadly accepted consumer product for quite a while. And that and that
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.880]   they will you know, they will keep pushing it because I think the prize is something that you
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:13.680]   can wear in public outside and that they just have to get there. So my guess is I don't think this
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.160]   is going to be a flop, but I also don't think it's going to be a hit. I am I will buy these
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.200]   spectacles. If they ever solve that problem, I will buy the spectacles. I don't think this puts
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:27.920]   them in a better position or worse position to make the spectacles. And I kind of agree with
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.200]   whoever these leakers are that Apple should just forget it and wait till the specter work hard on
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:39.200]   the spectacles. How about you, Andy? I think that they can make it a big success if they are
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:45.440]   concentrating on like the HoloLens market. If they're saying if they are selling this to enterprise
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:51.120]   or selling it to the military, they're selling this. Can I point out that HoloLens is for all
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:57.440]   intensive purposes dead. The military has backed out of that deal and Microsoft fired the team.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:04.640]   Don't you already have a signal? That's a bad idea. I think that Apple though can sell to these to
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.680]   basically when he come to Apple has a cache that a lot of other companies don't have. Microsoft
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.480]   is really good in that they can basically bend over backwards for an enterprise market. Apple is
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   really good in that you can basically tell a community of architects that we will create the
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:24.240]   the greatest visualization tool, the greatest demo tool, a tool where once you once your client comes
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:32.880]   in to your VR space and you hand them a $3,000 pair of Apple goggles, that's not going to seal the deal
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.920]   on creating the addition to your public library, but it's going to help. I think that they can,
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:43.040]   for a limited product, they can have some success. They still have an uphill battle to simply say that
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.560]   virtual reality is for anything other than watching movies and playing games at this point. They're
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.880]   going to have to create that market. I think if anybody can create it, it's probably going to be
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.840]   Apple, possibly because they've got some of the most wonderful mutants in the developer community
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   at Apple. I mean, the people who are just going to just going to find the awesome in this product
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.480]   and in these APIs that Apple never imagined and if Apple is smart enough to follow where an
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   independent developers lead, they really could go somewhere. But this is unprecedented. Apple has
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.600]   its true $60 billion in cash. It's no longer 120. They've been doing a lot of buybacks lately.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   But still, that's more than couch cushion money. And they are the company that can keep,
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:36.000]   even their definition of we've created a failed product is, no, no, no, Apple TV, it's a hobby.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.520]   It's a hobby that we're spending a lot of money and a lot of development on and we're keeping in
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.320]   the price list and we're still shipping. But it's a hobby. So they could continue this as a hobby
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:50.560]   for a number of years until display technology moves up, until mobile processors move up,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.240]   until a lot of things move up. And until again, third parties tell them,
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.000]   here's what this thing is actually for. Again, I keep coming back to Apple Watch.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.160]   They didn't set out to develop a fitness watch, but everyone told them, "Hey, that's a great
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.960]   fitness watch." And Apple said, "Yes, we are geniuses for creating this wonderful fitness watch."
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.280]   Yes.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.800]   Zach, what do you think?
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:13.840]   Hit or miss?
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:20.320]   I think that developer adoption is going to be virtually non-existent because
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:27.600]   you've had the success of the App Store for the iPhone, the early success for the iPad,
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:33.280]   and then kind of a pullback on the iPad in terms of apps, the utter failure of the App Store on
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.680]   the Apple TV, on the iMessage App Store. So I don't think there's going to be a lot of developer
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.680]   enthusiasm there, and just because of the price is like the big reason. But it's not something
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.400]   that I think the lower is going to want to invest in and risk. But it doesn't mean there won't be apps
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:56.800]   though because the apps that will matter are developer partners Apple does now before it's even
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.040]   out, which is you want to make sure that you've got big game makers, you want to make sure that
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:06.720]   you've got all the video streaming services that as many as you can come on board. And that
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   reminds me of something that I guess I was so forgettable I forgot, but I tried a meta quest
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.920]   too, which I think is four out of three hundred dollars, and this is 10 times that. But anyway,
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:25.040]   I spent about a day and a half with it. I tried, I literally didn't know what it was for. I didn't
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:30.480]   know what people were buying it outside of the curiosity of a new gadget. And what I learned
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.520]   pretty quickly is that it's really a gaming console, and it's not the best gaming console. You can get
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:40.160]   better ones for the same amount of money, but it is a gaming console and like gaming consoles,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:45.680]   you've got not just games, but you've got the streaming video apps. And there's that. And I watched
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:56.240]   Netflix on the Quest 2, and it was like a virtual TV and like a ski lodge. And it wasn't fullscreen
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:02.560]   immersive. But I had an issue where I was wanting to lay down. I was watching it, but it was like
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:07.200]   relative to where I was. I couldn't quite get it right and like reset my reference. So it was
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   much harder than watching a TV on the wall. And bottom line, I think that experience sucked.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.920]   And if there's one thing Apple can do, it can look at a market, a category and say,
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.320]   you know, this exists, so there's obviously interest in it. It's not gone away yet. But we can actually
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.240]   do a good version of that. And I think they will do that. I think it'll be a really good
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.760]   maybe gaming device, maybe communications device, but definitely a good way to watch TV, watch movies,
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:41.040]   watch sports that they bought. They bought next VR a few years ago. And that was an actual service
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:46.640]   that you could stream NBA basketball games among others and have a virtual experience,
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.880]   you know, viewing of it, of course, I'd seats without being there. And in that pit, just,
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.600]   you know, it's more compelling. But it's I think it's got to get a lean heavy on entertainment.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:04.320]   And games. And I'm not sure that the communication stuff, you know, is it going to be a better
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:08.720]   face time experience than just using your phone in your hand? I'm not sure the AR stuff. They've
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:14.880]   already built that up for years. So they've got that to work off of. But you know, AR for one.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.920]   And then the entertainment stuff is going to be a big one, I think. So I agree with you so
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:29.040]   strongly to this day, the best thing I like about about VR glasses are simply an app that puts you
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.920]   again, this is making sounds so boring, but an app that simply puts you in the best seat
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:42.800]   in a really good movie theater with a huge screen. I mean, my favorite, my favorite movies is 1776.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:49.600]   And my Blu-ray is like 235 to one, like the really, really wide screen aspect ratio.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:55.040]   I have never seen it in a theater. And the first time I just randomly grabbed and popped it in.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.480]   And I'm looking at the I'm looking at the cinematography and how these things were set up.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.840]   And for the first time I realized that there's a there's a shot in which John Adams is checking
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:08.080]   John Adams and Ben Franklin are checking in to see how Jefferson is doing, like writing the
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:13.760]   Declaration of Independence. And of course, Ben Franklin just he's an old band. So he immediately
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.040]   like goes to the back of the room, gets into bed and starts napping while the two guys in the
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.160]   foreground are talking. And because I've only ever seen this like on a TV in my living room,
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:27.600]   as soon as I saw that in the virtual huge theater, realize that, oh, you clever bastard.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   I'm because I'm I'm supposed to be looking at these two guys in the foreground. I'm not supposed
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:36.160]   to be really paying attention to Ben Franklin at all. He's supposed to be in my peripheral vision,
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:40.480]   but I've never had to be I've never been able to see this with something my peripheral vision before.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.720]   So a lot of people, if this is going to be their first virtual reality experience,
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:50.400]   that could I don't think it'll be $3,000 worth. But once they get it down to $1,000 inside the
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.360]   Apple store and they can test it out, that that's the sort of thing that gets people at least puts
[00:59:55.360 --> 01:00:00.240]   the product on their radar. Maybe not I'm going to buy it now, but hey, I've got tax refund coming
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.680]   in four months. Maybe I'll use some on mad money for one of these.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.720]   So I have a quest to and I don't think it sucks. But I do think it points the how shall I freeze
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:15.760]   the zag? It points the way to where it could be better. I enjoy it. But like and like I have a
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.520]   skybox, I think is the name of a good the good movie playing app on the meta quest. And you know,
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.960]   it's grainy because it's a low resolution screen, but you can sitting in that theater watching
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.480]   something, it can be an actually good experience. And I always had that thought of like now imagine
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:38.080]   it with spatial audio and at actual high resolution that you're sitting in a movie theater. Also,
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.440]   I'll say 3D movies, which are really lousy in a movie theater because they cut the brightness in
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   half when you put the glasses on on a set of VR goggles 3D movies actually look good because
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.880]   their full brightness in your eyes and and at high resolution, those will look great. So I think
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.440]   Apple because they've got a movie a video service and a movie store and all of that like I think
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.960]   that they're going to lean in on that and I think that that will be good. And then games, I would
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.000]   only throw in on top of games that the gamification of fitness has actually been very successful.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.160]   And that's why you see meta trying to buy like Beat Saber and then Supernatural and like they
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.680]   know what hits on their platform and and that's Apple will learn the same thing if they are all.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.640]   I mean, they're already taking tips from what meta's learning. And so like fitness is already
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.160]   an Apple thing, right? So fitness in VR and I know it sounds kind of weird, but the truth is,
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.960]   and I hope it's sweat proof, but the truth is sometimes, you know, exercising where you can be
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.360]   in an immersive environment where you don't have to think about exercising that can that has shown
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.760]   already to be successful. So there are there are niches. It's just not going to be like every,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.160]   your mom's not going to call you up and say, I'm getting this VR thing, right? Like I just,
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.600]   I think it's going to be some very specific niches. And I hope Apple satisfied with that because
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.000]   they're going to have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah, and three grand is in the
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.400]   crazy amount of money to spend on a home theater setup. Especially if you look at, you know, you
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.320]   live alone, you buy a TV and a home theater setup. So it's just for you. Well, this is just for you
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.920]   as well, but it's even more just for you and it's portable. So that's pretty good. And we know that
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.640]   Apple's doing VR content already with TV plus they've got that worked out. We know that they
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.520]   wanted VR rights for NFL. And that was why they walked away. Oh, I didn't know that. We didn't
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.840]   know that. Oh, yeah, I was really excited out that that that was sort of the breaking point for
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.920]   the deal to have Sunday ticket was they wanted right to things that exist yet, i.e. virtual reality
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.880]   streaming rights. So take the next VR NBA scenario and apply it to football. And the NFL wanted to
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.400]   sell that separately and understandably. So so this is kind of surprising to me because honestly,
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:53.840]   maybe people like to watch movies and football games all by themselves. But it's a social thing
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.200]   for me when I'm watching football, especially, I don't want to sit on us couch with three other
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.040]   people wearing headsets. No, but it will get you a social thing with your friends who are not
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.000]   local, right? And there are a lot of people who are more isolated. I mean,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.080]   the idea is sitting all in that ski lodge watching the football game to watch in the football game,
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.440]   and you'll be able like you're sitting next to each other, you'll be able to talk to each other
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.880]   while you're watching it. I think that that I think there's some potential there. It's not for
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.400]   everybody, but I do think that there's some potential there to watch a movie with your friends
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.880]   who you might not be able to see a movie with otherwise. And the other cool thing is when they
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:33.280]   shoot live events like in 360, the ability to direct your attention to whatever end of the court you
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.520]   actually want to focus on. Again, when I first positive experiences with VR was actually with
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.600]   Google cardboard, because they had some sort of a what was lip sync challenge that that Jimmy Fallon
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.480]   was hosting or whatever. And so they did like a 360 and they put the 360 camera just at a random
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:57.120]   place like in the audience. And it really taught me a lot because because the audience was it was
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:03.440]   like a it was like a music audience where everybody was no seats, everybody was standing up. It was
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.360]   kind of crowded so you couldn't move around. But that makes it perfect for virtual reality,
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.640]   because that means that you're not going to be walking around doing things you can't do,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.400]   you'll be always there. And I was doing this without even thinking about it. I was doing the same
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.040]   things I do whenever I'm at a live performance where yes, I'm paying attention to the performance,
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:24.400]   but I'm actually want to actually want to see look at the edge of the stage to see like I want to see
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.520]   the tech guys who are like trying to solve a problem. I want to see the host who's going over
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.800]   some notes. I want to turn around and see where the lights were the cameras. And that really does
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.680]   put you in a place where I'm not simply passively watching entertainment. I feel like I'm actually
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.040]   there. And so Jason's right. Like if you had a situation where you're going to create essentially
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.080]   virtually four seats at a stadium where you can be talking to telling your person through your
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.080]   friend five or miles away saying, Hey, look, look at what the coach is doing over there. I think
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.920]   he's signaling for a change over there. It doesn't matter that the camera operator is not looking
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.440]   there. The fact that you can change your point of view and look there. A lot of really cool things.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.400]   It's it's going to be hard to change these really good first experiences into something that
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.600]   makes you forget how much money you spent on this thing. I am going to go on the record saying,
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.560]   no, that's compelling in the least to me. Nobody wants to wear these things for more than 10 minutes.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:23.200]   A certain percentage of the world gets sick, which is never a good thing for a consumer product.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:31.120]   I just think this is a massive flop for Apple. And of course, when you say that, then the first
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:36.800]   that, you know, I'm now the Steve bomber on the iPhone guy. It should have a keyboard. Where's
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:43.440]   the keyboard? But I have to wonder what is it that Apple could do that would make this thing
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:50.080]   better than all of the things we've already seen PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive and the
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:57.360]   Quest and Oculus is what are they going to do that's better? Is it I mean,
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:02.720]   I think it's licensing bills. I think it's partner deals. I think if you can have this thing that
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.360]   has Apple music live concerts that you can attend from anywhere in the world, that's compelling.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.120]   And it's not something that you see. You won't see places to do it. You don't see meta doing it.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.680]   So it's Apple's ability to have partners in media and entertainment that they already have
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.760]   relationships with. And if they can bring that to the headset, I think that's something they can
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.240]   do that others don't do or haven't been able to do. Yeah, they can also they can also leverage the
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:31.120]   iPhone into VR basically, make every iPhone into a VR in a 3D capture device. I mean, the things
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.640]   that are being done with neural radiance fields right now, that if just by virtue of the fact that
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.600]   you have an iPhone, you don't maybe even get your own an Apple VR headset. But the fact that you
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:48.400]   were shooting shooting someone's birthday with an iPhone and you knew and you pushed you on the
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.680]   on the camera carousel. Now there's there's a nerf panel on there that through whatever
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.360]   alpha magic they would do to make this happen. You're now as you move around is capturing more
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.960]   details from there. And now when you share something, either by FaceTime or just via
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:09.600]   via Apple Photos, you get this new experience. There's a it could really let's just say it could
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:16.400]   make the green bubble even even more small, even more nasty, even more egregious saying, oh,
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.840]   you can't you can't you can't join the VR chat. Okay, that's fine.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.920]   Enjoy your emojis. I also will caution people
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.480]   that one of the things that happens with these every time people put them on for the first time,
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:37.520]   they get so excited and so, you know, jazzed and this is the few it's like the segue is this
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.640]   the future is the future. And then wait a month and see if they're still using it a month later,
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:49.520]   because in every case, in my experience, a month later, it's like I'm back to watching the TV.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:54.880]   Oh, one other caveat as long as I'm being cranky, those of you history buffs who are running out
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:03.840]   now to download 1776 should probably be made aware that Andy is talking about a 1972 musical version
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:13.520]   of the history that that you know, I haven't seen it Andy. So maybe it is the best movie ever made.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.040]   I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite. I wouldn't say it's the one of the best movies ever made.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.760]   Yeah, you have to get around the fact that it is a singing and dancing musical about the founding
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:32.240]   fathers. But yes, it's it is intense. I'll I'll the 32nd thing I will promote with is that
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.080]   they got the original cast from the Broadway production that did like hundreds and hundreds
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.920]   of performers performances. Each one of these actors knows this role and has dug into it.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.480]   And by the time we get halfway through, you're wondering, is this America thing ever going to
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.800]   happen or not? Oh, wow. So it's really good or more. Also, is this America thing ever going to happen?
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.640]   If you're if you're a friend of if you're a fan of friends, you'll recognize the fountain
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:05.120]   from the opening credits of friends there. You will actually see Ben Franklin, John Adams,
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.760]   and Richard Henry Lee, like doing a big number around that fountain. Oh, well, that makes it worth
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.880]   the worth the price of permission. I will be watching it tonight, because you've mentioned it before,
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:22.240]   and I've always meant to and thank you for reminding me. And also to to Zach and everybody at nine to
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:31.840]   five, Mac. Well done. Not falling for this. The tweet that says first real world look at Apple's
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:39.680]   mixed reality headset parts from a Twitter user with a protected account who has Mac rumor says a
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:45.200]   track record for sharing accurate information about Apple components. Although somebody in the
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.360]   comments here at Mac rumor, it's points out that this picture of the microphone in the so-called VR
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:58.800]   headset looks suspiciously exactly like the picture of the microphone in the home pod. I mean,
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.040]   maybe they would reuse the part. Why would you make a new microphone? But I don't know if we've
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.720]   learned anything anyway from these pictures. So there you this is around the time where if they
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.960]   were if they were if they were started to manufacture hardware, this is around the time that at least
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.200]   we're willing to entertain the notion that we're starting to see products leak from the
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.880]   somebody in China will have taken a picture and put it on their protected Twitter account. And so
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.600]   and my understanding is that the hardware is done. So that would be that that absolutely
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.920]   seems to be the case. Yeah. Okay. We have been told that you will have to carry a battery in your
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:41.520]   pocket. Right. It's it's plugs into a separate battery that that'll make me get a special shirt
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.880]   with a battery pocket. Apple have accessories. They'll have a sock version. Oh Lord.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:53.120]   Battery sock. Your neck warm. Right. Battery belt. I don't want to be that guy. But I think I am
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:59.040]   that this thing is two book edition is destined to have as version of horrible. I mean, you you
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.880]   might be right, Leo, but I will say, I mean, you talk about people getting sick, but you know,
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.760]   part of that is the lag. And if the Apple does a good job with the lag, they might not make people
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.080]   sick. And the weight of the battery, like, I think that having a battery thing snaking off of this
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.760]   thing is super in elegant. And I kind of can't believe that that's really going to be the case.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.560]   However, the counter argument is they tried it with the battery on the unit and it made it so
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.680]   miserable to wear. Nobody wants to wear it. And they when they took it off, the the average length
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.480]   of time people could wear it really increased, which would address your whole nobody wants to wear
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.560]   it for more than 15 minutes. So maybe that's a sign of them making a good trade off, which is,
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.600]   it's it's less elegant, but it's more usable. Who knows? Yeah, that's it's an interesting design
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.160]   problem where once you once you start off for the first thing you write on the whiteboard after all
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.760]   if you get all the data from R&D saying, okay, we're free. There is no way for anybody to wear
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:56.560]   this and look stylish, dignified, elegant or anything. So we can make it big, we can put antennas up
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.520]   there, we can have wires hanging off it. None of it matters because if anybody had dignity with this,
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.840]   they would not be using this outside away from a power outlet anyway. I will I will point out that
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:11.760]   the segue, which was in fact very useful, fun to ride died because you looked like an absolute
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.600]   on it. And then I would submit Google Glass probably died for the same reason. So let's not
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.920]   deprecate. Well, also because you had to walk around with a camera with, we didn't have a light
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.480]   on it to say, Oh, by the way, I'm actually I could be recording only use your VR headset in the
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.120]   in the privacy of your own home. No one knows. Nobody knows your look like a dummy. Yeah, please
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.680]   wear pants. I cannot stress is enough. Put on some pants. Well, they're
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.280]   reminds me of a matter they've avoided this. You don't have legs. So is no issue. Right.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:45.360]   So it reminds me of an iPad keynote where Steve Jobs read a note from a customer who said I was
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.200]   sitting in a cafe with my iPad and it got a girl interested in me. And that's what I call a magical
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.600]   device. I don't think it's gonna happen with this. No, that's not you. Women is not a it's not a
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.440]   chick magnet, as they say, although if Apple would offer chip, chick magnet stickers to put on the
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.760]   front of it, that might help. The only problem is you may not depending on how like they get these
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.720]   external cameras running, it's possible you're not even gonna know when like, generation Z people
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.280]   and zoomers are making fun of you and posting tick talks about your expense.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.800]   Or you can miss the connection. Yeah, you missed your love of your life. Well, because you're in the
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:26.960]   army, Mr Star Wars boy is coming back, baby, and he's wearing a headset. All right. Okay, I think
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:34.320]   we've talked about this enough. We have till June. I've been thinking about because we talked last
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.200]   week about this rumor that the M's there'd be an M 315 inch MacBook Air and so forth. And you
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:45.440]   made a really good point, I think was Jason, that Apple's not gonna clog up WWDC. If they're
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:51.120]   gonna release these, they're gonna spend all the time talking about these headsets. Yeah. And
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.080]   laptops will be somewhere else. So that's why that's why there these rumors that maybe
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.240]   there are M through MacBook Air is coming sooner than we would think. If you combine it with the idea
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:06.080]   that that the old air last year, which came out in July was announced in June was actually really
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.600]   late, and that they may already be on to the next cycle. You know, I always thought that that
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.560]   was a little bit wild as an idea. But you probably, if you've got that product, you probably either want
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:23.120]   to, you know, introduce it after WWDC or before WWDC. Because I have a hard time imagining
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.920]   if there's a new headset at the conference that there's gonna be room for what is basically a
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.560]   consumer product, right? Maybe the Mac Pro could be announced there, but MacBook Air, there's got
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.240]   to be a better venue for it than that. Yeah, you had actually a great piece in Mac world about this.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:45.920]   And it sounds like you think that it's probably Apple's gonna go to now it's gonna be a TikTok
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:52.400]   yearly cycle for the M processors. You know, Mark Herman made this weird statement that Apple
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:58.320]   has declared they want to be on an annual cycle for the chips, which I don't think Apple's ever said
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.360]   anything like that. And there's been no evidence to that. But at the same time, they do it for the
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.040]   phone, right? And so I could see them saying we also want to do this for the M series. And
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:15.760]   and my thought was maybe the M base model M series comes out every year, but they take the desktop
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:20.400]   computers and they sort of like interleave them where like each of each of the set of desktop
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.840]   computers that the pro and the max and ultra chips, those get updated every two years. But the air
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:31.840]   gets a new chip every year. And certainly the M3 feels like it might be a bigger step forward
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.360]   than the M2 was because of the TSMC is going to do a die shrink down to three nanometers,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.240]   which means you're going to get the energy efficiency and the speed boost and all of that. And then
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.360]   also they're going to skip probably a generation of the A series or, you know, we may see that they're
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:53.040]   not going to always debut their brand new chip architecture with the phone. They might actually
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.240]   do it with the max sometimes. And there's no reason that they couldn't they couldn't do that. In fact,
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.280]   who's to say that in the end they even use? I mean, they would like to use the same cores in all their
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.360]   products. But like if they've got a GPU core that's a little hungrier, maybe it goes in the
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.680]   Mac and it doesn't go in the iPhone. There's a lot of possibility there. And we just haven't seen
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.400]   enough cycles of this for us to know exactly what Apple's trying to go for. And it all got
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:23.920]   muddied by I think the pandemic and the factory showed shutdowns and things like that. But M3
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.480]   sooner rather than later, I'm kind of getting into it now. I think I think it's going to be a big
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.000]   step forward for them. I loved your piece. Apple is about to unleash the full power
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.280]   of the Mac. We're going to see what the Mac can really do when it's finally set free.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:47.120]   Set my Mac free, please. I don't write those headlines, but I like it. That made me happy.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.720]   I'm excited. I keep changing them too. There's SEO going to look. Mac world does what it's going
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.800]   to do. I don't I don't work there anymore. I'm just like those Apple designers who left is like,
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.600]   I don't know. I don't know. I write some words. They put a thing on top. That's all.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.720]   They put a thing on top. Yeah. I read a more many conscripted conscripted A B headline testers.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.960]   Yes. So they've changed. They've changed. You know, I was searching for it and I couldn't find it.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.280]   I guess that's because they changed the headline. Yeah. I keep changing the headlines. It's wild
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.640]   stuff. That explains it. I was going to. Where is I know I read this. I know. All right,
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:26.240]   let's take a little break. Zach Hall great to have you nine to five Mac. Appreciate your being here
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.840]   with your Falcon heavy. And I'm talking about the rocket that's sitting on top of his Mac
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:38.400]   classic. That's a good combination. I like that. Is there isn't there a launch, John today?
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.520]   There's always a launch now. They're doing a three supply day of the week. Yeah, every day of the
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.160]   week. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what's not every day of the week. It's pie day. Happy pie day,
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:58.640]   everybody. 3.14159. A knowledge. That's all I could say. I should have brought to you by zip
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:05.280]   recruiter. Oh, we know intimately here at Twit what it's like when you get you get notice from
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.600]   an employee. They said, well, I'm moving on to greener pastures. It's been great. Thank you very
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.520]   much. Bye bye. And then and then we look at each other go, Oh, we're gonna have to fill that
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.560]   position. Oh, we're all gonna have to work extra hours to get this stuff done happen most recently
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.960]   when our wonderful Ashley left. She wanted such a long commute. She found somewhere closer to home.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.440]   We had we needed somebody in our continuity department. And what do we do? We went immediately
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:35.200]   to zip recruiter. Zip recruiters where we do all our hiring. And it really works. And I'll tell
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.800]   you something, but you know, Lisa gets the email and we're at breakfast. She posted on zip recruiter.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.440]   What first thing that happens is it goes out to all the job boards. Oh, 100 plus job boards,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.560]   plus all the social media. So your post gets seen everywhere. What's nice is you don't get inundated
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.840]   by responses because all of the calls and the emails and the resumes go into the zip recruiter
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   interface. So you can you can go there when you have to moment and scan through it. You can have
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.680]   actually automated screening with true false questions or multiple choice or even essay questions.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.440]   So you can get rid of people that just, you know, don't fit the bill. And then zip recruiters
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.120]   does something remarkable. They already, you know, a lot of job hunters come to zip recruiters. So
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.400]   they have a million plus resumes on file current resumes. They actually scan them, look for people
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:27.440]   who fit your needs and then send them to you and say, Hey, I got I got 10 people here who might work.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.400]   You invite them to apply and I have to tell you, when you invite somebody to apply to job, it really
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.800]   makes a difference. They they wake right up. They respond to you immediately. They show up for
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:43.600]   the interviews. It's a really great experience for them and for you. So as Lisa posted in the morning,
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.280]   an hour later, she says, Oh, because we're worried, you know, we're sweating. What are we going to do?
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:52.400]   She's oh, here's a good one. Another hour. Oh, here's a couple more good ones. By lunchtime,

[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.520]   on, keeping the staff working and keeping new shows launching. Thanks to club, Twitch members.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:57.200]   We just relaunched home theater geeks in the club. We've got hands on Mac, hands on Windows.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.920]   This week in space started in the club. And as soon as we got a big enough audience and got
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.640]   some advertisers, we're able to make it public. It's now got video as well. What do you get? For
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.600]   seven bucks a month, I think it's a great deal. You get ad-free versions of all the shows. You
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:18.000]   get access to the best darn social network in the world, the club twit discord. And that, I tell
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.680]   you why it's I realize why it's good because everybody paid seven bucks a month to be there.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.960]   So nobody's going to mess around, right? It's a very exciting, fun place. The other reason is
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:33.200]   great. It's all people like you. You're it's friends. You also get the twit plus feed with shows we
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:40.560]   don't put out in public and titled Linux show and the Gizfiz and Stacey's book club, lots of events.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:47.360]   Twit.tv/club to it. It would help us immensely if you'd become a member of the club. And we'd love
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:56.240]   to have you there. Seven bucks a month. Twit.tv/clubtwit. Thank you, Jason Snell, for pitching in with
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.680]   an animated GIF. That's that's what makes the club what it is. Do it. Do it. Do it.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.360]   I know the rules. I've read the room. I know what it is.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.000]   That is the only bad thing about the discord is so many animated GIFs. Like there's not there's
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:21.680]   not enough room for text in here. All right. All right. Yes, by the way, Patrick
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:29.440]   Della Hantie, our engineer says the GIFs inside our epic. So come on in. Anyway, I just wanted to say
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.000]   thank you to all of our members. We really appreciate your support. Thank you. Clubbers,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.360]   I need a name. I don't want to call you twits. Need a name. Twitters? No, can't do that.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:49.520]   Hmm. Jason Calicanis, maybe I had some mixed feelings about having them on
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:56.080]   Twitter on Sunday to talk about Silicon Valley Bank. Others shared that. And so we didn't put
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.680]   them in the main show. We put them on afterwards. But one of the things I wanted to ask him,
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.560]   you might remember when Elon first bought Twitter, he started calling himself Chief Twit.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:12.800]   A moniker, which I've had for more than 12 years in many of my socials and so forth.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.840]   It's on my business card for crying out loud. And I just, and then he stopped doing it a few days
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:24.080]   later. He just dropped it. And I think I just, I thought maybe because Jason was in the room
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.480]   that maybe he said something to Elon and I asked him, he said, well, I can't talk about that.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:35.360]   But I think maybe I owe you Jason. So there you go. Debt, debt fulfilled. Thank you for getting
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:41.440]   him off of my handle. Shareholders meaning this, you know, they do it every year.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:47.520]   The shareholders were meek mild. There were no, as far as I know, there were no rebellious
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:54.240]   shareholders. And you might look at the headline here saying Apple shareholders approved 40% pay cut
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.640]   for Tim Cook and say, well, that sounds pretty rebellious, but he wanted it. He asked for it.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:06.480]   Right. Zach, this wasn't, this wasn't a surprise. That is correct. And it makes sense. You know,
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:12.880]   we praised Andy. I think you praised another CEO who instead of firing people took a cut and pay.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.160]   I think that's kind of what's going on, right? Is it rather than letting people go,
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:26.000]   one way to be fiscally responsible is to take a pay cut. Also, you're making a lot of money with
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.760]   your, with the value of the company itself. So it's, it's not nothing. But the fact that there's so
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.960]   many CEOs that are not even willing to take a symbolic gesture that they are so disconnected
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.400]   and $50 million, that's a lot of salaries that could be protected.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:49.680]   And got $50 billion last year from Tesla just to put this in perspective. Yeah. Cook got in 2021
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:56.320]   and 2022, $100 million, which is an awful lot of money. So when you say you got cut by half,
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.640]   still 49 million ain't bad. He's still, he's still buying the name brand cereal, the kind of
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.480]   comes in cardboard boxes, not the kind that comes in plastic bags. He's not clipping coupons.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:12.160]   Right? Not yet. I mean, he might, but only because he's, it's fun for him, which actually that does
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:16.880]   sound like Tim Cook. I think he's probably a coupon clipper. I guarantee you, he's a, look how he
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:24.080]   dresses. He's, he's definitely a coupon cutter. Yeah. Remember, that is off the rack from Coles,
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:30.000]   I swear to God. Steve, Steve, remember how Steve Jobs is a famous story about how he delighted in
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.080]   scamming the cafeteria out of like that they take it out of my pay, but my pay is only a dollar of
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.000]   dollar a year. It's like, I don't know where the money's coming from, but it's great.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.560]   And of course, it's a charming story. And of course, the reality is, is that there's somebody
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   in the accounting group who actually monitors all of Steve's things and was like, Oh, jeez,
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.400]   and was counteracting and like adjusting and like doing all this work. And Steve's like,
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.520]   ah, it's a joke. He probably was making hours of work for some poor accounting person.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.840]   Undoubtedly, it was not just one of these situations where just nobody knows where the money went.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:08.080]   Like somebody knows somebody is working on that very hard. Oh, can you transfer that money out of
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.000]   payroll and put that over to? Yeah, I can see that. So, Jason, you're saying that they,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.240]   that they were passing the cost onto us, the consumers that we were helping to pay
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.920]   that man's burritos. I think they went to the couch where they kept their billions in cash.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.400]   And then every now and then somebody would go in there and pull out a, you know, a large number
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:34.080]   bill and then just apply that to Steve's, uh, how much cafeteria could the lunch have been,
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.480]   you know, really seriously. Yeah. That's like a micro second of interest on their,
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.640]   right? You know, he did, he did, he did ask for the extra guac and that is enough.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.120]   But you know, isn't that, isn't that the way I mean, the bill, a billionaire founder who gets
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.920]   off on the idea that he's getting away with free pudding. I love that idea. But at the same time,
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.520]   like you don't become a billionaire. This is the thing about like the baseball owners are
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.480]   complaining that players are getting paid too much by other owners, right? And it's like, boy,
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.800]   yeah, never get between a billionaire and any amount of money that they could be cheap about
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.520]   because that's why they're a billionaire. Yeah. The cheapest people I've ever met. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.480]   Yeah. So Tim Cook, I mean, I also think Tim Cook is just that guy, right? I have never met him.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.240]   I've only seen him like, I've been near him, but I've never met him. But you just, you get the sense
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.040]   that he's kind of a sensible guy. Yeah. He's probably like, yeah, I don't want the best thing.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.120]   Give me the like the the mid range of a thing and like, can we save a little money there?
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.040]   That it just seems like he's that guy. Yeah. And he's already said what he's going to give
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:41.040]   some of the money to his nephew, right? And then the rest will speed a charity. Yeah. So it's not
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.720]   like he's, I don't mean it's not like he needs it. I mean, honestly, I could live in four million
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:52.800]   easy a year. Sure. Yeah. One tenths. Couldn't have that in cash. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So I
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.240]   don't know this is from Bloomberg. And I don't know if it's cause or concern or not. Apple's new
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:05.600]   challenge, a wave of key executives leaving the company, Mark Gurman writing last week,
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:13.440]   an unprecedented wave of executive departures, about a dozen high ranking executives, most of them
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.680]   not SVPs, but just below senior vice president, many of them vice presidents.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.280]   Some of the most german says some of the most important figures at Apple responsible for day
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.720]   to day operations in industrial design, the online store, information systems, cloud,
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:37.120]   hardware, software, privacy, sales, subscription services, procurement,
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:43.280]   a far higher amount of turnover than we've seen in recent memory cause for concern or as he just
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:50.160]   people want to spend more time with their money. I think that there's there comes a time, especially
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.760]   at Apple, when you realize that you've gone as far as you're going to go, there are a lot of people
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.560]   whose brains are wired up such that it doesn't matter that they have this amazing position at
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:04.000]   one of the most influential and famous companies, tech companies in the world. It's that I'm never,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.520]   I'm never going to be able to run. I'm not going to be running a show at this point. And sometimes,
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.520]   there's so much cross pollination inside inside that culture that it's like, I could spend,
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.200]   I could be making just as much money sitting on the boards of other people's companies
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.040]   than I can actually having to deal with the argument about whether or not we should actually
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:28.240]   be shipping VR glasses. And I'm now I'm now 43 years old. I would like to be able to play with
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.760]   my Legos that been boxed a boxed up in my closet on made. I don't think this is a really big deal.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:41.600]   It wasn't it wasn't german's newsletter, not as like a feature article, which as our friend
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:47.200]   Renee Richie pointed out that that's he's a great source for all kinds of stories. There's a reason
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.840]   why he's put some stuff in the newsletter and some stuff as like feature articles. He's speaking
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.240]   more as an analyst here than he would be as a reporter. But it's but it is interesting. It's
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.600]   not it's not it's not as interesting as what's happening at Google where you have like, I can't
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   remember her name, but 20 one of the earliest employees at Google finish her career as the CEO
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.760]   of YouTube. I'm sorry. I'm kidding. I'm just kidding. Thank you. Susan. Thank you very much.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:17.360]   That's that's then you get you have a problem where she's only spent the last nine years at
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.800]   YouTube. She's just such an intellect, but also some someone who understands how Google works,
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.440]   understands what it's good at what it's bad at what its priorities should be, what its priorities
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.680]   could be. So when you have when you someone like that leaves, that is a brain drain.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:37.200]   Even when you're replacing it with somebody who's been at Google since 2007, 2009, I think
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.720]   that's that's a brain drain and Apple is really hard to do because the people who make it up to
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:48.080]   the very, very top levels, those the people that have been born, they were born and bred in the
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:54.800]   apple petri dish. They they were raised and trained in the apple culture that that Steve created,
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.880]   that Steve groomed Tim Cook for, they're making sure that there's always a legacy plan so that
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.920]   whatever it is that makes apple apple will continue through changes in leadership. So this is not
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:11.440]   something to really be worried about. There's kind of a scale. It's heavy hurdle. This person's
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:19.040]   name before. If not, can you find past references to them and in press? If not, then you know,
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:24.160]   it's it's maybe just normal churn. I don't have a lot of data to compare to other years, you know,
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.760]   but I think as a writer, you do want to make what you're writing sound like it matters.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:36.880]   So there's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. It is not. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:41.280]   Apple stock price, he says, I don't think this is accurate, but he says Apple's
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:50.160]   stock fell 30% last year following three years of major gains. I don't follow Apple's stock price
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:56.400]   really closely, but that is one reason we talk about that because employees are often compensated
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:05.520]   in stock. I think 80% of Tim Cook's compensation will be stock. So the stock price becomes extremely
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:12.400]   important. I'm with Zach about these lower level people. I'm not sure whether this is normal churn
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:18.080]   or not, but I think that we've we've been saying for years now that brain drain is a potential
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.880]   killer for Apple. And because as Mark, I think really pointed out very well,
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:28.720]   separate from these losses is an executive team that's all about the same age. They've all been
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:36.160]   there for 20 years. They are all incredibly rich on Apple stock at this point, right? And you do
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.360]   wonder, all right, well, what's the next generation of leadership? And the risk is if you've got people
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.240]   who are all in there, like in their 50s and 60s, and they've made a lot of money and they've been
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.720]   there a very long time and they're very senior, not only are they not going to be there that much
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:58.800]   longer, but who is coming up behind them? And if they feel stifled inside Apple, and they've also
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.760]   made a lot of money, maybe they get out of there. And that's the real risk because the other factor
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:10.960]   here that we all have seen happen is Apple is such a very particular culture that you kind of can't
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.520]   import. There's some jobs that you can, but there are a lot of jobs you can't just import a senior
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.480]   executive from somewhere else in the Valley, or even somewhere else on Planet Earth. You kind of
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:26.720]   need to bake them inside of Apple, at least for a while, if not for decades. And so if you're losing
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.360]   your top level, just because they're going to age out at some point, and then the level down below
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:37.120]   them, there's this question of like, are they ever going to be given the reins? And you risk a
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:43.520]   scenario where you lose a lot of your best people, and you can't replace them, or you have to go
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.600]   outside to replace them and risk damaging your corporate culture that you work so hard to build.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:52.640]   I do think they're a victim of their own success, essentially, but I think that that's true, that
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:35:00.320]   it's a major risk. And I wonder if they're new ahead of people who also is not an Apple person,
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:05.920]   somebody brought in from the outside, if that's job one for them is retention, because at some point,
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.800]   you will lose your stars if you can't give them more to do.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.400]   Yeah, I think but with what's happening in retail, where they hired in some people who were superstars
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:20.880]   like at Burberry and other organizations, the question is, do these people find themselves
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:26.560]   wanting to live out the rest of their careers at Apple, or do they serve a certain purpose at Apple
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.880]   until Apple has assimilated the knowledge and expertise they have? Did they get this thing launched?
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.960]   And then at some point, they realized that again, there's not a whole lot left for me to do.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:44.160]   I'm fully vested. I've completed the terms of my stock dividend. I can just simply leave here
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:51.360]   and with $50 million in my pocket. It reminds me to be interesting to follow up on what really
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:57.360]   impressed me when the first news broke about Apple's car project was the number of high profile
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:02.720]   executives at other companies that Apple managed to bring in. I mean, the slide deck they must have
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:08.080]   presented to say, I know that you are one of the top people at BMW. We would like you to abandon
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.800]   this career track. You've been on this one company for 20 years and start a secret project that we
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.280]   cannot even that may not even turn into an actual product. Would you like to join us?
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.400]   How much? I know that they've showed a lot of those people, but have they managed to create
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.280]   a world in which people who have experiences and perspectives that were not grown at Apple
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:33.040]   can find themselves productive and listen to at Apple. Or once again, we're just here to tell
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:38.560]   us where to buy tires. Once we've got a source for tires, you can go. Well, Apple will be telling
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.960]   you which iPhone you can get soon. They've introduced something called shop with a specialist.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:51.920]   You can connect directly to somebody who will say, you should buy the most expensive iPhone.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.400]   They must think that people are a little confused. Or maybe this is because people don't go into
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.840]   the store anymore. They don't like it. They can't go into a store. They don't like the service that
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:12.240]   the third party carrier stores are providing. Maybe Apple says, well, we should make a better
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.960]   way to buy a phone at home. You think that's the reason for this?
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.920]   It's going to be a really good experience with the headset when you go to buy iPhone.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:30.240]   Oh, maybe that's it's all for VR now, right? So if you go to Apple.com/shop/buy-iPhone,
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.560]   then you can just I'm not going to click this because I don't want to embarrass myself.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:44.400]   What's that? It's the yellow phone faster. You can get some pics. What do you think? I don't know.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.920]   Zach, come on. You're a reporter. Call these guys. Find out what they tell you. Do they just
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:56.560]   unilaterally universally recommend the iPhone 14 Pro? Or they sometimes say,
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:03.440]   an SE would be right for you. There are reports that the iPhone 14
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.600]   non-proversion isn't selling as well as maybe expected, especially the plus version.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:14.160]   A little bit reminiscent of the iPhone XS and XR cycle where they needed to improve sales
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.800]   way unexpected in terms of what they were seeing, way below expected.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.920]   And they did a number of things in the store and online and elsewhere.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.200]   It was like we've got six tricks we've been waiting to do to roll out. We're going to do
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:33.680]   all at once to improve sales. This reminds me of that, but it's just one thing. So it's something
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.080]   that they probably haven't mined anyway, but a pretty good time to roll it out if they are trying
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:44.000]   to improve sales of lower end phones. They must have some data about how many people are going to
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.240]   the online Apple store, but leaving something in their cart or spending a lot of time with
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.440]   new models, but not closing the deal. I thought reading the press release from Apple,
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.520]   I think it's significant that they are specifically mentioning this, that this is something for
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:04.000]   people, for customers in the US. There's no even hint as to at any point even expanding it to
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.360]   Canada or other countries. If so, it would be an interesting data point about how they realize
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.640]   that they're not going to have Apple stores all over the world. They want to make sure that they
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:17.920]   can give like white glove, not sales pressure, but at least that sort of Apple store experience
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:23.920]   everybody. So I think Zach has a point here. They've seen where there's something where they're
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.360]   just not closing the deal and they're thinking that it's probably not that expensive to get this
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.400]   up and running and see if that helps any. Personally, I would be terrified to use this service.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:39.280]   It's just not a comfort zone. What I do like is Apple's business chat feature,
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:45.200]   where I messaged essentially with companies. That is awesome. I talked to my phone carrier
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.520]   through that service and it's always a great experience.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:55.680]   So that's interesting for Apple. Oh, you didn't do it on the Apple page to your carrier. You went
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.600]   to your carrier page to talk to your carrier. I go to spotlight search on the iPhone, I type
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.960]   in T-Mobile and then there's a chat icon and I talk to it's basically their chat support,
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:14.480]   but you view it through Apple's I-misses service essentially. Apple uses that as well,
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:19.600]   which is pretty good. You can say, well, what's after that video and you could see maybe them
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:23.920]   doing this for at least for their own stuff and elevating the chat experience to be video
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.120]   experience. It's still the thing I wouldn't want to do, but I could imagine family say,
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:32.720]   you know, use their service. Don't ask me these questions. Ask Apple these questions.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.920]   Yes. And they'll help you out.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:41.920]   That's who really loves this. Us. Don't ask me. Just call Apple. Maybe this is a
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:50.000]   kind of preparatory to a VR experience where you could kind of walk into an Apple store.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:57.920]   I doubt it. I mean, $3,000 before you can even start shopping. If any company is going to do that,
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:03.280]   it would be Apple, but I don't know. You're not walking out with an $8 per iPod socks.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.040]   I have to say, with that transaction,
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.720]   Microsoft released the HoloLens for a long time in the Microsoft stores. Remember those?
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.800]   They would have a HoloLens tryout thing that you could go try them out. I am sure Apple will do
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.240]   something like that with the VR headset. Yeah, you can go to the Apple store. Yeah.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.320]   Yeah. I would also say separate this from my phone cells currently. You can look at this as
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.040]   they're you're about six months away from the next iPhone iPhone 15. And so this is the time
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:32.160]   you want to release this not then. And then they'll have this as an option when the next iPhones
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:36.080]   come out because it'll be. Work out the bugs when sales are low. I mean, I don't know all those
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.600]   yellow iPhones that they're going to be pushing now. That's really important.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.440]   Actually, I'm sorry, you joke, but right here in the right here in the headlines of customers.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:51.040]   There we go. Right in the right in the sub that Apple who uses shop with a special
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.600]   sold video, customers in the US can now connect with an Apple special sold videos,
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.160]   shop the iPhone line line up, including the iPhone 14 14 plus available today in an all new
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.520]   yellow. Yeah, marketing 101 right there. Remember, by the way, I just I find it
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.040]   charming when Apple actually makes an attempt to try sales things because there was a time
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.840]   not that long ago, like four years ago, where iPhones just sold themselves.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.320]   And you know, Angela, Aaron's was entirely she brought in for Burberry to sort of make it an
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.160]   experience and we're going to plant some trees and it's going to be a community space. And then
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:27.280]   they had that that drop off after the brand new iPhone, you know, went really big the first year,
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.000]   but then it started to tail off. And and since then and anybody who works in Apple retail can
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.720]   tell you this, but since then Apple's been like, Oh yeah, sales techniques. Let's try that. Let's
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:42.400]   actually try to sell our products. Can we push products and get and since then it's just amazing
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.080]   to watch a company that came so far just on like laying their products out and saying have added.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:54.240]   And now is actually making an effort to find ways to boost sales. But they are the last four years
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:00.640]   has really been Apple's retail arm trying hard actually like working to sell product in a way
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.320]   that they never did before. And good news, you don't have to put your pants on because you will
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:13.520]   not be on camera Apple reassures you that don't worry. And it looks like the whole idea of this is
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.240]   that the salesperson can share their screen so they can they can say, well, look at this,
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.640]   look at that. So there's, you know, it's kind of an interesting idea. If somebody does this,
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:28.960]   call in and let us know and I'd love to get your experience. I can't really do it on the air because
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:32.880]   I'd have to say ahead of time, may we record this and all this stuff and
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:39.840]   you know, I just, by then, you know, they say, well, you need to talk to PR by and I don't want to do
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:47.600]   that. Good. You know, another way to buy an iPhone, not a bad thing. Of course, because I just
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.800]   bought the new big HomePods, Apple is now rumored to be working on new big HomePods with their own
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:44:01.600]   display, which I would actually have preferred. But okay. Ming Chi Quo says the display won't be
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:09.040]   here till next year based on third party supply chain companies such as Tian Ma, Chinese display
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:14.160]   manufacturer, it wouldn't look like the existing HomePod would feature a seven inch display,
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:20.000]   kind of more like a Nest hub or an Echo show. Yeah, which I think is smart.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.960]   Yeah, it's a good category. I've won the one for a while. I actually just retired my Echo show
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:29.200]   because I got tired of Alexa saying, by the way, I can do this thing. I'm like, shut up.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:34.560]   I'm talking about upsell. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And believe it or not, Google much. So I switched to a
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.840]   Nest hub and it's much more pleasant. But all the while I'm thinking to myself, I really would
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.440]   like Apple to make a product in this category because there really is value. I mean, I don't
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:46.800]   think it's going to sound like the big HomePod. It's probably going to sound more like the HomePod
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:51.520]   mini. But I think this is a great category. I love having a little smart speaker in my kitchen.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:56.240]   I use it to add things to my shopping list. We use it for named timers when we're cooking.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.280]   You can do it all hands free. And you put Apple TV on it. You can have, I mean,
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.000]   that's how I will watch the news in the kitchen is I'll put it on the
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.880]   edible device. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Right. So there's a lot of application for these things,
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.280]   either by your nightstand or in your kitchen or whatever. And I'm surprised Apple has
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.880]   taken so long to get here because the first time I use the first Echo Show, I was like,
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.440]   oh, yeah, there's value in just showing some data. And Apple has built like they've got watch apps,
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:28.160]   they've got widgets, they've got TVOS, they've got so many different ways to show you little
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:34.240]   bits of information on top of just Siri that it's like a screen would really help here, right?
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:39.920]   Like even Siri on the HomePod, it's sort of like it's it's it's hobbled by the fact that
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.480]   on the iPhone, it can like say, why don't I show you this thing? And on the HomePod, it's like,
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.320]   sorry, I can't do it. I give up. And so having a screen to display stuff on it just, it's a good
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:56.320]   category. I wish Apple had been in it for years, but I'm very hopeful about this product because I
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.960]   do like the smart speaker with a screen. I think it's a good thing. Yeah, I'm with you. It does,
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.120]   it does, it does change your relationship with it too. Like if you have just the speaker that you
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.840]   can just put anywhere, that's fine. But it's this disembodied voice, which means it's very easy to
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:16.960]   ignore that you own this thing. Whereas if you get into the habit of if I have a Google smart screen,
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:22.640]   like on my kitchen counter, when I get in, or when I'm making breakfast, I will be looking at it all
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.440]   the time just to get the time, you know, and just to get the weather, not the I'm not the most
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:32.560]   critical part of my day, but it is a touchstone to remind myself that this thing exists. And as a
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:39.040]   result, I use it a lot more. And just as you say, Jason, the ability to to get information via
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:43.840]   audio, but then I will give you more information if you look at the display. But I'm not going to
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:49.200]   talk for three minutes explaining about what the air quality index is that there's a cold front
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.160]   that's approaching from Buffalo that we expect a dusting to truth. No, but if I tell me, I tell
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.760]   me I'm going to need a jacket. But if I want to look at the three day forecast, I can just turn
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:03.680]   over this way. Atlas do something, I think, to make the HomePod more relevant to make it more of a
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.520]   again, it feels it feels like a hobby right now. They've there's a lot of opportunity for them to
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.360]   make it into a real product. Zach, are you a screen fan?
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:18.160]   I would like this to exist in the pitch of it's like an echo show or Google, excuse me,
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:23.200]   into Facebook portal. But with FaceTime, that's a pretty good pitch. Yeah, actually, I used to
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:27.520]   FaceTime my mom every every week. She's 90. She liked doing it on the iPad, but was a little
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.760]   complicated. She had to get the iPad in the right. She always answered on the phone by accident,
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:38.720]   etc, etc. So I got her a nice big echo show with a nice speaker. And now we just call that way. And
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:44.400]   she far prefers it. And Apple's missing a beat here because they could easily, this would be a
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.040]   great FaceTime device. Right. And they could solve the problem of when you talk to your grandma
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:53.680]   in FaceTime, usually you get like you don't see your face on FaceTime because of the way they're
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:59.120]   holding good, you know, the app. You got to thumb on the camera. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, this is
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.600]   next. This is in her bedroom. It's next to her bed. It's right there. I can also, they have things
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.600]   like drop in, which FaceTime doesn't have where I could say, Mom, wake up, are you there? So I
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:13.440]   could talk to her directly. There's a lot of nice features. And I think Apple could really take
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.000]   advantage of this. It is odd that they haven't done it yet. One thing I'd love to see Apple do.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.320]   And honestly, I'm kind of amazed that Google and Amazon haven't done this yet, which is add some of
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:31.520]   the chat GPT like AI features. And Siri could be so much smarter. I understand Apple doesn't want,
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:38.640]   you know, Siri to start saying crazy, hallucinatory things. But that's an opportunity for Apple to
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:45.440]   kind of reactivate Siri who I'm sorry to say, it seems like the numscall next to Google Assistant
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:56.560]   and Amazon's Echo. Yeah, there are never times that Apple tells me to, I will look that up for
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.800]   you on Google. Like, okay, I could have done that. Yeah, that's not helpful. Yeah. Here's what I
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:06.320]   found on the web for that. That's not why I asked you. Siri's very good at things that Siri's very
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.400]   good at. Yeah, which is very limited. But yeah, she does what she does. I don't know. I don't want
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:18.640]   to hear Rock Me Amadeus anymore. I mean, it does sound good on those paired home pods in my
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:26.480]   living room. There is actually a story. Big, big week for Falco. Big week for Falco.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:31.120]   It's good. Big week for Falco. There is a story in town. There is a story in digit times
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:39.680]   that Apple is in fact, trying to build its AI chops. One of the things that happened when,
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:46.160]   you know, chat GPT took the world by storm is all the other companies,
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.200]   meta and Amazon and Google all said, hey, we got that we could do that. And of course,
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.800]   raced to release at Google's are just about to release its own version of chat GPT.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.360]   They've released it to developers and scientists already.
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:07.040]   Meta didn't want to release theirs, but it was leaked out and 4chan got it. Now you can play
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.920]   with that too. Do you think Apple is like everybody else has been doing this? I mean,
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:17.200]   they've had some really good people working there. Yeah, absolutely. And a few years ago,
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.240]   they enhanced their own recruitment by finally allowing these people to publish papers on their
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:27.200]   work, which was part of if you're a researcher, you're not going to get your next job if you don't
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:30.960]   have lots of published papers. So that's I think the difficulty that a lot of these companies are
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:36.000]   having Google included is that I mean, they're they're kind of flustered by saying, no, no, we
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.240]   didn't do chat GPT, but we have we've been doing AI for years and years and years. There are so
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.720]   many features in your phone right now that are powered by artificial intelligence. Just the
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:50.720]   one of my favorite examples is just the the smarts behind getting that getting your your
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.960]   iPhone keyboard working to figure out that no, you didn't quite hit that letter T.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.960]   But did you did you did you intend to hit a Y? Did you intend to hit the letter below it?
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.880]   And it's not just simply doing statistics on the number it's basically predictive text,
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.400]   which is chat GPT, essentially an extension of the basic technology there. All of these
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.600]   companies are saying, look, we've been doing this all the time. We just haven't done this half
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:22.640]   big chat app that goes nuts and starts doing so doing things. They're so ridiculous that it
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:29.760]   becomes a week's worth of inventory for late night late night talk show monologues. So I mean,
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:33.760]   Google, I think today just announced that they're putting a whole bunch of AI. It's encouraged
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:39.520]   them to put some take to move a lot of these AI features out of the lab and into practical products.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:45.920]   Google just said that they're putting a bunch of AI coding tools into their cloud product.
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:52.400]   They are rolling some more AI tools into Google workspace. And I hope that that's the way things
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.560]   work. I don't think Apple needs to get into the game where they're saying that they have to say
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:02.160]   that here is our chat client. I think what they need to do is next year show off that we've got a
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:07.600]   major new version of Siri without mentioning any technology behind it, but saying that we don't
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:13.440]   have to simply ask the question it will answer, like have a conversation and it will figure out
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:18.000]   as you go, as you both figure out what it is you actually need to know, and then give you actual
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.480]   practical results. They must have technology. Maybe they're chasing though by seeing how
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:28.240]   it's badly it's gone in some respect. Here's a somebody a a comment or a Mac rumors asked chat
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:33.840]   GPT to write a press release. This is what it came out with Apple today and asked that Scott
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:39.360]   Forestall has returned to the company as CEO, replacing Johnny Ive who would replace Tim Cook
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.520]   just three months ago. The decision to bring back Forestall was made by the board of directors who
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:48.480]   were dissatisfied with the direction the company was taking under Ives leadership. When you can get
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:54.480]   a AI to give you a controversial information like that, I think Apple might think twice.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.120]   We don't want Siri already has a bad reputation. We don't want her announcing that Scott Forestall
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:09.760]   is back as CEO. There's too many half-baked people who feel as though we're nobody if we don't have
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:18.400]   an AI product out on the shop floor right now. It's kind of a galling is not the right word, but
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:22.960]   Google has been laying the groundwork for hey, we think that we might have something interesting
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:27.520]   in our new large language models that we might be able to roll into a real product.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:32.000]   We're going to spend two or three years showing you the basic research because we're trying to
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.840]   figure out how well it works be what the problems with it are what are the ethical biases are with
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:44.400]   it. Then finally, what are people going to be what's the best way to implement this in a
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:51.680]   feature that's going to be relevant to people as opposed to let's have a robot write your Babylon
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:58.640]   5 Star Trek fanfic for you. It's like they've been doing this time. Google did an entire 40-minute
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:03.920]   press event on their AI just basically saying here's something we're doing, but we are doing
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:11.280]   this slowly and responsibly. We want to slide with with unfactual information on it saying that
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:15.120]   the James is going to discover an exoplanet done 12 years earlier.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:23.600]   Oh, big egg because that wasn't that wasn't just oh, we did a live demo and it said something
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:29.760]   wrong. It's like no, we created a slide that we looked at. We could approve red and we chose
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:35.520]   to publish it anyway. That is, let's keep walking around this yard till we find a rake and then
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:44.480]   let's jump on it with both feet. It could conceivably bring Siri back into the race.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:50.080]   Right now, she's so far behind. I don't think she's considered a front runner in any respect.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:58.880]   One of iOS and macOS's biggest and least publicized features is its automation tools.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.120]   So imagine if they were to hide all of this, again, they're not going to say it's based on chat.
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:06.960]   Oh, here's our large language model. They just simply say if there's something you would like
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:12.160]   the Mac to do for you, describe it, you will have a conversation via text or via voice.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:16.800]   It will basically show you what it thinks it can do. You can make corrections to it. And then
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.800]   if you really, really like it, it will add you can upgrade your own operating system to an extent.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.400]   Write your own Mac software. If you can simply have a conversation with with slow mo and we'll do
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.800]   it for you. That's from your absolutely right. You're smart. Don't say it's artificial intelligence.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.920]   Don't say it's chat GPT. It's a new feature.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:39.680]   They've also got a feature that is voice control, which is an accessibility feature that's really
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.640]   powerful where you can actually do functions on your Mac without touching the mouse and keyboard
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.320]   more than just doing an individual Siri request went off. I think as we've been on
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.480]   AirChat, GPT-4 has been announced and it does pictures now. So there's that. For me, with Apple
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:04.800]   though, Apple hired John Gene Andrea, a former Google AI expert several years ago. And you haven't
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.760]   heard much from what's come out of that. We certainly haven't seen it. Early on, there were
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:14.800]   reports that John Gene Andrea's team, he wanted Siri to focus less on getting trivia right,
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:21.120]   annoying facts and expanding its domain, this database is of knowledge, and more focused more
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:27.680]   on just having a wider, re-architecting how Siri works in general and being able to,
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:34.160]   instead of adding new domains every year, instead broaden serious capabilities in general,
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:40.400]   sort of rework how Siri works in general. We just have not seen that yet. And it seemed,
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.680]   every year for WWC, it's kind of a feeling of, oh, is this the year we're going to see that the big
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:52.240]   Siri overhaul that's based on those years of work. And it's not even rumored. The next big thing for
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.560]   Siri is to be able to activate Siri by just saying Siri and not saying, hey, before that.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.480]   That's a bad idea. That's a bad idea. That's a bad idea. That's a bad idea. You already wakes up
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:06.400]   way too much. It's not about John Gene Andrea was hired to do. Look what I've done. I've cut the
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.480]   number of words in half. Yeah, no, that's not it. So separate from chat, GPT and everything. There's
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.560]   got to be something in the works for Siri in general. I think so. Yeah. You're right. That's
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:21.360]   a very good point. He's senior vice president, machine learning and AI strategy. The other thing
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:28.400]   to remember is Apple now builds into all of its hardware, iPhone and Mac, a neural linguistic
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:34.880]   processing unit. So they've got AI and they've been spending quite a few
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.880]   transistors on putting AI into all their devices. They should they completely plan to use it.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:47.440]   Right. That's their big advantage. And when we say what should they be doing with AI,
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:50.720]   one of the things that they've already started to do because we've seen it with
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:56.640]   some of the visual models is make an effort to either help people or just do themselves
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.600]   the work of taking some of the, for example, the open AI models and putting them on the neural
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.240]   engine because that neural engine that's in most modern hardware to a certain degree,
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:11.280]   they keep increasing the cores, they keep increasing the speed. Like that is their silicon advantage
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:16.720]   for all of this stuff. So if they can give everybody a leg up to make sure that there's a version that
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:23.120]   is optimized for Apple silicon, then all of that ML stuff is going to run so much faster and better
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:28.640]   on Apple hardware, which is just a huge boost for their hardware. Even if it's not their software
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:32.480]   that's running, it's running on their silicon. And that's a big, that's a big deal.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.720]   And it's going to be an even bigger deal if they can get compact versions of those long,
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.320]   large language models that will run completely on device but having to connect
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:45.040]   to a cloud service because if Apple's brand continues to be very, very aggressively, hey,
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:51.520]   we put privacy first, we put security first. That's something that Google wants to do,
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:55.280]   everyone else wants to do. But if they simply, if they say that, no, this is our priority that
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.800]   we will not put AI on our device, if it has to connect to a cloud service and send your data off
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:04.960]   the device in order to do it, that is something that they could argue very, very strongly. Of course,
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:10.960]   the question is just going to be, I think that most people, if you give them a cloud-based AI
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:15.360]   service that transforms how they use this device, they're not going to care if it's on device or not,
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:20.240]   so long as it is responsive. So yeah, it ties into their hardware scheme, it ties into their
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:25.520]   software scheme, and obviously ties into their OS scheme. Yeah, and to Jason's point about,
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:30.800]   they've got the hardware there, they did tune the neural engine to work with stable diffusion.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:35.440]   So that was something that was very topical and they did the work. I think somebody was very
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.680]   interested in doing that, but they were able to optimize the neural engine for stable diffusion.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:45.520]   I've been using Whisper to do podcast transcripts and it runs okay on the CPU cores,
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:51.120]   but I'm using this excellent C++ version that somebody's done. But somebody at Apple ideally
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:57.040]   should help in generating the version that uses the neural engine because if it's flying on my
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:03.760]   Mac studio now on the CPU cores, imagine a version that runs power efficiently on an iPhone so that
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:11.760]   you can start having like on-the-fly transcripts of everything, anywhere just using the Whisper AI
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:17.040]   model, which is amazingly good. Like you just need to do the work and I hope Apple does more of that.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:24.560]   Yeah, it's just quickly it's one of the most transformative features that on my pixel phone
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:29.280]   is just the ability that we change. Just the volume slider has a button underneath it that has
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.920]   closed captions on it. And it means that if you push this button, any audio going through the
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:41.120]   audio system will be closed captioned or even translated. So the idea that if I'm on YouTube and I see
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:46.640]   a press conference that's happening in France at, "Oh damn, there's no captions of this."
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:51.920]   The ability to, that seems like absolute magic that there are no captions provided with this,
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.440]   but I can have this translated for me automatically on device. Those are the things that turn,
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.040]   that they're transformative to how you not just how you interact with the device, but how you interact
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:06.400]   with the world through the device, particularly if you're talking to actual people. Yeah, it goes
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:11.840]   both ways. That's one reason why you'd want to have a screen on a HomePod because now with
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:18.720]   Chat GPT4, it's multi-modal, which means it can handle images and perhaps do the translation you're
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:26.400]   talking about. This is from the Verge. Apparently, it's best at looking at images and then giving you
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:31.760]   information about it. This is a picture of, "Can you explain this meme? Sometimes I look at pictures
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:37.680]   of the Earth from space and I marvel at how beautiful it all is." And Chat GPT4 was smart.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.480]   It says, "This meme is a joke that combines 200-related things, pictures of the Earth from space and
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:49.440]   chicken nuggets." Here's one. What's unusual about this image, the unusual thing about this image,
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.600]   is that a man is ironing clothes on an ironing board attached to the roof of a moving taxi.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:02:02.000]   Spot on, Chat GPT4. And this image, what's funny about this image? This image shows a package for a
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:08.400]   lightning cable adapter with three panels. Panel one, a smartphone with a VGA connector. Oh,
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:13.440]   it knew it was VGA. That's good. The package for the lightning cable with a picture of a VGA cable on
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:20.000]   it and a close-up of the VGA connector with a small lightning connector at the end. Oh, the
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000]   humor in this image comes, I don't want this now, comes from the absurdity of plugging a large
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.760]   outdated VGA connector into a small modern smartphone charging port. It is a lightning connector with
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:36.800]   a VGA plug on it. We've got our answer for what Apple needs as it's killer app for AR glasses.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:44.000]   For AR glasses, it is, "Explain the joke to me." Explain your meme. What the hell's going on?
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]   Oh, I see your joke.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:55.600]   But it's this multimodal stuff which Google's been talking about for a couple of years now
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:01.200]   that can be really enabling. There's the Be My Eyes app that you've heard.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:06.880]   There's a great example, but that's humans. Well, not now because the new version of it
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.360]   integrates GPT-4. Oh, no, kidding. And you do a lot of that stuff just with a software device.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:17.440]   So the ability to simply describe what's a... If you just have an inner piece in and it's describing
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:23.280]   a running commentary of you have your phone in your pocket just like, what was that movie?
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.600]   She, her, she, we have a safety pin so the camera is always sticking up a little bit.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.200]   And it's just always describing things to you that would be significant to you if you're walking
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:36.800]   through the city if you have problems with vision. There's a lot of stuff that goes beyond, again,
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:44.800]   Babylon 5 fanfiction generated automatically. We have to transition past the cute demos and the,
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.760]   "Oh, we can look at this fail and figure out what does this technology fundamentally do and how can
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:54.400]   we use that as a flavor enhancer for a lot of the stuff that we already have where we haven't been
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:58.480]   make work work work?" That's a great story I hadn't heard about. Be My Eyes is an app that would
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:03.840]   normally is a blind person. You'd launch it and you'd say, "Can somebody volunteer to come online
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:08.160]   and describe this for me?" And human volunteers are required, which means it doesn't always work.
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:14.160]   Right now they're going to add chat GPT-4 so that you don't have to wait for a human volunteer to
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:20.480]   help you. That's pretty incredible. That's great. I can't wait to see that at work.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:29.120]   Congratulations, Academy Awards were Sunday and Apple won an Oscar. Okay, it wasn't the best picture
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.920]   Oscar they won for CODA. In fact, I think only Netflix was in that category with everything
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.720]   everywhere all at once. And of course they won seven Oscars, so Netflix is very happy.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:46.240]   That was a theatrical release, right? That was an A24 release. It's true. It's not really
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:49.760]   yeah Netflix. Yeah, yeah. I don't think it's even on Netflix. Netflix right now,
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:55.280]   where it's on Showtime right now. It's got a lot on the stage. I got to say they kept saying thank
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.000]   you Netflix. They must have pumped some money into it. Apple did get an Academy Award for Best
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.360]   Animated Short, The Boy, The Mole, The Fox, and The Horse. So they can celebrate a little bit
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:11.360]   for a Best Animated Short. And it is in fact on Apple TV. You know who's the executive producer of
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:21.200]   that? Sure. Johnny Ive. No, really? True story. Yeah. Wow. That's cool. It also got a BAFTA for
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:30.080]   Annie's and the NAACP Image Award. So very well awarded. That's great. That's great.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:37.920]   Finally, I don't know if this will be of interest to you or not. But this is from a website called
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:46.400]   REEX. The World REEX at r-e-e-k-e-s.net. The story of So Sumi and the Mac startup sound.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:58.480]   So this is a clip from a movie. Let's see. I was interviewed. REEX is a sound designer who did So
[02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:02.800]   Sumi. I was interviewed for a documentary about the history of the Macintosh of San Francisco.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:07.840]   They gave me free beer too. But sadly, my favorite scene was deleted in the final edit.
[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:14.080]   Fortunately, I found this clip on the cutting room floor. So Mr. REEX is telling us the story
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:22.000]   of So Sumi, which is in my opinion, the most annoying Mac sound. But anyway, I won't play it
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.160]   because I don't want to get taken down. But it's great that it's here. Yeah, it's like,
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:32.720]   it's truncated. He also talks about the startup sound. Jim REEX.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:40.880]   He said something that I thought was really funny about how their inspiration was actually
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:44.800]   the chord at the end of A Day in the Life by the Beatles. And once you think about that, you're like,
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:52.240]   "Oh, yeah." Because it's that big C major chord. And that's what the Mac startup sound is too. So
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:07:01.920]   it's absolutely. And you know how much time Steve Jobs spent certifying and writing notes on that
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:06.560]   one chord because that's the sort of stuff that he would absolutely get into. Well, actually,
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:13.680]   what's kind of interesting is Jim says he had to sneak it in because the Mac team
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:20.320]   didn't want to put in another start sound. They said it was done. And so he went over to the people
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:29.120]   doing the ROM and said, "Can you sneak this in? Should I maybe, it's on YouTube. I don't want
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:33.600]   to steal this thunder. I'll just do this." Well, I guess we don't have sound.
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:38.080]   Who's the goal and that we're going to have to take it. I don't know where that's coming from.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:46.080]   Oh, there it is. Anyway, watch it. REEX.NET explains this is Sumi sound,
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:50.240]   which is, I think, the oldest Apple sound still on the Apple, right? I mean, that's the original
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:56.080]   beep sound. And the Mac startup sound, where she had to sneak in, gosh, I really want to play this.
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:03.360]   See the chilling effect the DMCA has on all of us. Let's instead of doing that, let's take a break.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:08.000]   There. Thank you. Was that the original startup?
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.880]   Yeah, the original little... It's a sine wave. That's terrible.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:18.080]   That's all they could do back then. Now we've got to the...
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:24.080]   When you watch an Apple TV original, it's a whole orchestra literally playing that same chord.
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:30.960]   So much better. So much better. Yeah. Let's take a little break when we come back to your picks
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:35.440]   of the week. Zach, if you want to give us a pick of the week, that'd be great. Not required,
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:41.040]   but I first, before we do that, I want to tell you about Zachtok. And actually, Jason has a
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:49.520]   little sound that he makes for Zachtok. Zachtok! Thank you. The Gilbert Gunford and Sock.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:51.440]   Chicken for Zachtok. Zachtok!
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:59.360]   What is Zachtok? Actually, it's an amazingly useful app that you will absolutely want to have.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:05.280]   There is nothing worse than going to a doctor's appointment and having expectations like,
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:09.040]   they're going to pay attention to me. And then the doctor's going, "Can we get this done?
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:13.920]   I got a golf date to make." He's just not paying attention. Well, the truth is,
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:19.280]   everybody has kind of different expectation from a physician or a doctor of any kind.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.000]   I like to have all the information. I wanted to all explain to me. There are a lot of people who
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.200]   would just say, "No, just give me the facts, Jack. What drug do I have to take?" And we'll leave it at
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:35.760]   that. On Zachtok, you can find the doctor that's right for you, quality doctors, who will listen to
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:40.400]   you, will focus on you, will give you all the information, or will just give you the bottom line.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:46.000]   Zachtok is the only free app that lets you find and book doctors. But here's the best part,
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.760]   patient reviewed. Plus, you can make sure they take your insurance. They're available when you
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.960]   need them. They treat almost any condition under the sun, dentists, chiropractors, all kinds of
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:00.960]   practitioners. When you're not feeling your best and you're just trying to hold it together,
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:05.120]   finding great care shouldn't take up all your energy. That's where Zachtok comes in. Using
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.160]   their free app, millions of users rely on it. You can find the right doctor that meets your needs,
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:14.560]   fits your schedule. The worst thing is call a doctor and say, "I need an appointment." They
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.560]   say, "Well, I'm all full up. I don't accept it anymore, patients." No, it was Zachtok. You'll know.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:24.720]   You'll know. And you'll know whether they take your insurance. You actually narrow the search down.
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:29.760]   I searched searching for a gerontologist the other day. Take care of one of our older relatives.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:36.320]   You can see exactly what you do. You limit it by insurance type. Are they accepting new patients?
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.000]   Can they do an appointment soon? All of this. You can book the appointment inside the app within
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.880]   just a few taps and start feeling better with Zachtok. Plus, those verified patient reviews,
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:52.320]   those are solid gold because you'll know ahead of time if that doctor is right for you.
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:59.360]   Go to zachtok, z-o-c-d-o-c.com/macbreak. You can download the Zachtok app for free.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.040]   Then find and book a top-rated doctor today. Many available within 24 hours. Now,
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:10.480]   I know you're smart. You could just go to the Apple store and just type in Zachtok and download
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:15.200]   it. Would you do me a favor? Because this was how they're measuring the effectiveness of the ad
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:21.520]   campaign. Go to zachtok.com/macbreak. Then click the link and I'll take you to the store. Actually,
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:28.000]   they have it up for Android as well. Zachtok.com/macbreak. We thank Zachtok for a great service,
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.160]   which I have used and really works. It was really great to be able to find that very narrow niche
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:44.160]   specialty and zero right down on it. For support and use it, zachtok.com/macbreak. Remember,
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:48.480]   don't go to the app store. Do that later. Go to the website first.
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:56.400]   zachtok.com/macbreak. What is this in the Discord? Somebody has posted, "Oh, you Jason Snell."
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:01.760]   Yes, I have a whole folder full of Mac startup sounds.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.920]   You can do any of them. You can do any of them.
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.960]   So that first one is the original, right?
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.400]   It's just a simple beep. Then since the '90s, when Steve Jobs was not there,
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:22.160]   they had guitar chords and they kept on trying to workshop it. I'm sure that when Steve came back,
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:26.960]   he was like, "What's going on with all these Mac startup sounds?" And had them pick a
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:32.160]   chime that is basically the chime we have to this day. It used to be like it varied from model
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.280]   to model. They were different ones. But it has been, I think, for the last 20 years,
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:41.360]   it's been the same chime. I can't believe we've gotten this far without anybody saying where the
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:48.880]   name Sussumi came from. So, Sume, right? Yeah, yeah, because the Beatles were suing Apple. At the time,
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:55.840]   Apple Records had the license for the name Apple and the Beatles basically said, "You can't do
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:00.400]   audio things. You have to only do computer things," because this was in a narrow where those were
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:07.280]   different. So, Sussumi was one of those like, "Yeah, well, we're doing some audio things. Take that."
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:14.000]   Ironically, now, I believe Apple bought all the rights to the use of the word Apple and licensed
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.360]   to the Beatles. To the Beatles. No lawsuits, right? But at the time, the Beatles were like,
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:26.000]   "Stay out of our playset," which is music. Apple had to resolve that before they could do iTunes,
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.120]   right? They had to solve that computer. Yeah, I mean, ultimately, the music and computers merged
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.960]   together to the point where it was going to be a problem one way or another. Wasn't it the Apple
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:42.160]   CD? They had their standalone CD player? Probably. It's possible. I'm going to play it. I'm going to
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:47.760]   take a chance. Here's Jim Reeks explaining how he got the startup sound in the Mac.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:56.880]   And just sort of owned audio. Now, I guess most famous, even though not a lot of people know this,
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:02.560]   but your most famous for something that every Mac user hears pretty much every day, which is
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:09.840]   the startup chime. Can you tell us a little bit about that? How did you... Why is it the way it
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:15.680]   sounds today? Yeah. Well, the original sound, if you remember, on the original Mac 128,
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:22.320]   was actually kind of a cool sound. I actually like that. It's... It's... I don't know what's the word.
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:27.760]   It's just a really... It's a sound sound. It's a point is the wrong word. But it's a good sound,
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:34.800]   like the original 128 Mac sound. And then when the Mac 2 came out, the color Mac was wild,
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:43.520]   and it was this big-ass machine. There was an Apple sound chip developed, and it had
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:50.720]   programmed... What I thought was actually a horrible sound. If you're a musician, you know about an
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.120]   interval call. It's a tri-tone. We're not going to have time for his whole explanation, but it's
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:01.520]   really good. I recommend it. But he said that sound. He says any musician hates that, because
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:10.400]   it's a tri-tone, which is essentially evil. Christen Kord or GTFO. It was a dark time. It was a dark
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:16.000]   time. Great explanation about it. I guess they're in a coffee shop. It's from One More Thing,
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:23.120]   which I guess was a podcaster, an interview show. Let's do our picks of the week.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:28.480]   Mr. Jason Snell, why don't you kick it off for us? I'm going to talk about something fun.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:32.480]   It's Marvel Snap, which is a game that came out late last year, which I love.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:37.440]   What I'm going to tell you is it has all the trappings of being one of these apps that you
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:42.240]   install, and it's a game, and it's going to get money out of you. The only way to play it is to
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:47.680]   give them more money and buy more gems. What I'll tell you is I played it for like three months now,
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:55.280]   a lot, and I haven't given them a cent. The fact is you can give them money for stuff, but it doesn't
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:00.880]   really affect the gameplay. It is also the most gentle. As somebody who's never actually played
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:07.040]   one of these collectible card games like Magic or Hearthstone, I have never played any of them.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:13.840]   It is very gentle with you. It teaches you how to play, and then as you level up, you get more
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:19.440]   cards, and you can change your strategy, but it does auto matchmaking. It's actually so gentle that
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:24.560]   I don't think you can detect when you go from playing against AI players to going, playing against
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.440]   real people on the internet. It's actually one of the great mysteries. Sometimes I play against an
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:36.320]   opponent, and they make bizarre decisions. I can't decide whether that's the AI being weird,
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:41.040]   or whether it's just a weird person on the internet making bad decisions, but it's fun,
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:45.280]   and it's short. Every game is six turns, so you play it in a couple of minutes, and then you can
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:49.840]   either play again, or you can move on, and I really like how snackable it is in that way.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:56.480]   All the cards are Marvel characters, hence the name Marvel Snap. It's a lot of fun
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:05.040]   free to play on the iPhone and iPad, and even on the Mac with Catalyst. Or on Apple Silicon,
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:09.920]   actually, I think it's just a straight up Apple Silicon translation of iPad. It's a lot of fun,
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:15.760]   and easy to play. If you're somebody who is looking for a new game on your iPhone or iPad to waste
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:22.000]   time on, I would say, give it a try. You may have given it a pass because it looks like it's going
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.920]   to be a sleazy game that just tries to rip you off, and you can play it without paying a cent,
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:32.480]   and still get the full gameplay. It's not a sleazy game, and it doesn't rip you off,
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:36.880]   says Jason Snell. Yeah. That's saying something. Yeah. That's saying something.
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:44.320]   How a day's. Yeah. Andy and I go pick of the week. A couple of picks for window managers. I'm a big
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:50.320]   fan of window managers. I wish that as complicated as like Linux is, I love the fact that no matter
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:54.480]   how you like your windows arranged, it can help you do that and help you do that on the fly.
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:18:00.800]   As I get bigger monitors, I have enough space that I can tile my windows, and my workspace is
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.680]   usually turns into tiled windows. I've got the document that I'm actually writing. I've got another
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:13.360]   tiled pinned window that has research on it, another tiled pinned window that's for slacks. I'm
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.680]   talking to people while I'm going. Overlapping windows are hindrance to my creativity.
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:22.880]   So there are two window managers that you can add on that really add things to the next level.
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:27.760]   Now the cheap one is rectangle that we all know and love. It's open source. This is the simple one
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.560]   that gives you sort of like windows like snapping where if you drag a window to the side of the
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.840]   screen, it just simply snaps to a size that's exactly half the size of the screen, whether it's
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:42.080]   top or bottom, and there are ways you can customize it. It's great because it's free rectangle app.
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:46.640]   You can get the pro version that adds a whole bunch of shortcuts, a whole bunch of different
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:53.520]   conditionals, saving how you set up your workspace. And I bought it because I was
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:59.520]   ashamed to find out much, much later on that there is people who are making like a rectangle
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:05.120]   pro, formerly hookshot, according to the rectangle app.com site. But I desperately wanted to give
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:11.120]   them $10, so I gave them $10. But recently I also found out about something that is an interesting
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:14.800]   twist. I don't use it myself, but I think a lot of people would want to know about it. It's called
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:21.920]   Swish from Highly Appininated. This is this is $16 with a free trial. What's the what's unique
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:27.840]   about this one is that it integrates really, really well with your trackpad or your multi-touch
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:33.600]   magic pad, so that if you don't necessarily want to use keyboard shortcuts or mouse drags,
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:39.200]   just simply like moving your mouse into the the title bar of the menu and dragging down twice will
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:45.120]   basically put it where you want it to go or close a window or move it. And it gives you much much
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:50.720]   more muscular movements like that. It's not the way that I deal with windows. I am very much a mouse
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:55.600]   and pointer sort of person. I don't really, for some reason, multi-touch on desktop has never
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:04.480]   really gotten past a squeeze, squeeze and stretch for me. But it's a good alternative. For those of
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:08.240]   you who are really manipulating a lot of windows all the time, if you're in the middle of a meeting,
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:13.920]   for instance, and you suddenly don't realize that you needed this thing, but you do. But now I was
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:17.600]   covering up this other window. I could see where that would be a very big thing. My choice is
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:23.760]   Rectangle Pro, but even the basic rectangle app.com free open source one will do you just fine.
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:28.880]   I couldn't do without a Windows manager because otherwise I would do nothing but okay. Okay,
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:34.640]   now resize and okay. Oh, now it's overlapping. So it's it's one of my go to apps.
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:38.640]   I use Rectangle, but I am this swish actually looks great. So I'm going to take a look as I do use
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:43.120]   it. It is. I tried it again. It's not for me, but it was very, very natural to use. It doesn't I
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:48.880]   couldn't get it to screw. I was as someone who doesn't use multi-touch. It was very, very easy to
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:53.840]   learn. It wasn't screwing up. It was doing exactly what it told me it would do. And so I think it's a
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:59.600]   very, very nicely crafted piece of software and 16 bucks and you own it for for life. And I like
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:05.280]   the ability to give a developer money. I love your I love the thing you created here is some money.
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:11.840]   There is whether you're whether it's a comic book artist at a comic I'm a comic on or whatever.
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:17.360]   There is no more fundamental thing than saying I like what you do. Here is some money to further
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:22.640]   validate this compliment. I agree. I agree. Have a coffee. It's on set app, but you know, I'm always
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:28.720]   I feel like I hope I don't know if people who are on set up get the full benefit of set apps. So I
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.960]   think maybe just don't you like you can just buy it. Well, you can just download it and install
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:40.400]   it as a regular app and register for 16 bucks. You don't have to like subscribe to set app in order
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:46.960]   to do it. No, but I know set app has like 200 apps and I think like Mike is a set app fan, I think.
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:50.000]   So I just mentioned that if you already have said they already have swish.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:56.080]   They do they do mention in the in the docs that there's a reason why it's not in the app store and
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:00.480]   it's because it needs permissions that the app store will not granted it because it's because
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:04.880]   again, it's not designed to simply play. It's designed to fix something that Apple doesn't think
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:11.520]   that needs fixing that is perfect in it of itself. Right. So swish. Swish.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:17.920]   Which is a wonderful sound highly opinionated dot co. Zach, did you want to give us a pick of
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:22.400]   the week something you like you're using your your fond of it could be a TV show, a book or an
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:28.000]   app anything you want. And you took mine. No kidding. I have a that happens all the time. Don't
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:37.040]   have a pick listicle. Oh, yes. Prepare. Yes. I'm ready. Yes. Yeah. First off, the cure is going to go
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:40.560]   on poor in North America for the first time in seven years. First off is in New Orleans. I'll be
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:46.160]   there. So there's that you're actually going to New Orleans to see the cure. It's an hour drive
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:50.160]   for me. Oh, where are you? I didn't I should have asked. I didn't know. Sure. Uh, Biloxi.
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:57.280]   Oh, so an hour away. You can see the cure. Go. That's it. It's the first stop on the tour. Yeah.
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:02.320]   First towards seven years. Oh, how fun. How fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Super excited about that. I
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:09.520]   recommend adopting dogs. I adopted a dog two weeks ago. She's four. Her name is Nova. She is a
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:15.280]   havenese dog. Oh, they're big. Those aren't those big. This is a small dog. I only have a small dog
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:19.920]   where I had this house. So yeah. Yeah. She's my first time having a small dog. And it's really
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:23.920]   cool. She goes everywhere with me. So I'm going to see. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:31.840]   jealous. Where's your havenes? Other room. Oh, all right. Yeah. TV show.
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:37.280]   Blyshman is in trouble on FX. Yes. I wanted to know if that's good. Is it good?
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:44.080]   I love that I'm a single dad. I'm divorced and it hits all the notes for me. So it's about a guy
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:48.640]   who wakes up and he's divorced all of a sudden and his wife has disappeared.
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:52.880]   His wife is a superior. He's got his two kids and boy and girl and man, do I know that one.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:57.680]   So I found that to be very relating not just for that specific situation, but also to sort of a
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:03.280]   career retrospective. Are you where you are? Are you married to Claire Danes too?
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:10.480]   I don't like to admit it, but yes. I watched it because I'm a big fan of Lizzy Kaplan and
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:15.280]   she's wonderful with it and Claire Danes is wonderful in it. But I don't I haven't
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:20.800]   recommended it because I think it's a little weird, but I think it's good. I really liked it a lot.
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:24.480]   Good. I'm glad you recommended it. Yeah. I was surprised by it. It was one of those where I had
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:29.120]   to watch every week the day I came out. Yeah. And then lastly, it wasn't FX show.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:34.880]   That's right. I see it on Hulu now. Yeah. Yep. And then lastly, Tiny Crosswords Plus on Apple
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:41.920]   Arcade on the iPhone. I've replaced social media apps with this. And I've kind of thought about it.
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:47.280]   And I think the reason I like this crossword app in particular is because everything's bite-sized.
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:53.040]   It's a way to make me do something with my phone when I'm bored or don't want to be doing nothing
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:58.320]   in line and grocery store or something. And then I think especially it makes me feel smart for
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:02.080]   figuring out very easy crossword puzzles, which I think is something I was getting from social
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:06.160]   media too. I looked at dumb takes and I felt smart in that. So it's a
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:10.880]   I think it's hysterical that you think a crossword puzzle replaces social media, but okay. Yeah.
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:15.360]   Okay. All the satisfaction of finishing the People Magazine crossword inning.
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:22.640]   I feel that. Or is it as easy as the TV guide crossword puzzle? Because that's really right.
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:28.080]   I know. And one more. We miss it. Yes. One more. Wow. And I felt guilty asking you for a pick.
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:36.080]   Okay. What else? Last one is if you enjoy Apple Tech podcast and you really like to have an
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:41.520]   American host and a UK host and if you like the kind of thing about an hour and a half long.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:48.160]   Jason does one. I do one as well. So nine to five my happy hour. I have to mention it here.
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:57.200]   Oh, of course. For that US UK magic just can't be you can't beat it. Who is your co-host on the
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:04.160]   happy hour? Benjamin Mayo. Yeah. Yeah. Never met him, but we've been having this two hour call every
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:10.880]   week for a kid for almost 10 years now. Yeah. Yeah. If we ever find the Italian and we're going to
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:16.000]   do a whole connected alternative universe thing. So yeah, dangerous, dangerous. Watch out. We have
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.240]   a lot of resilience at nine to five Mac, but unfortunately the nine to five Mac.
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:28.240]   cert problem is hitting the website right now for the happy hour, but yes, it isn't a security
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:32.560]   issue. But non it's just an expired. It is an Apple podcast. Yeah. So don't get it from nine to
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:37.840]   five Mac. Just go to your favorite podcast app and search for nine to five Mac happy hour.
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:43.440]   That's right. Yeah. I like it. Hey, I really appreciate you coming on, Zach. It's great to have you.
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:49.280]   And real pleasure. I would come back anytime. Well, then you will. Then you will.
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:54.000]   I think Alex Lindsay will be back next week. But if he's not, I'm going to be giving you a ring.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000]   How about that? All right. All right. And I just downloaded tiny crossword plus, by the way,
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.120]   because I love that. I love that. I love easy crosswords.
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:07.760]   Every four or five puzzles I throw in not not a hard one, but one that's got many more squares.
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:12.160]   And that feels like the challenge. Oh, wait a minute. Now, so here's the first clue in the first puzzle.
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:19.360]   Number that comes before two. Exactly. But I was a little condescending.
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:26.640]   Well, a lot of clues are rhymes with this word or like that.
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:34.400]   Okay. That was that was tough. I think I'm ready for it. That's good. But I'm on a little like 260.
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:39.360]   You're on little one. So no, it's it's harder. Does it? Okay. No, there's a lot of tools.
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:43.920]   Doesn't get hard. This is fun. This is fun. I like it.
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:47.120]   Wise bird that gives a hoot.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:57.600]   Owl Christmas Carol and a gram of Leon. No, well, another term for therefore ergo.
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:01.760]   See, it's getting harder. We got Latin now. Man's best friend.
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:08.720]   Havenies doesn't fit. Well, I don't know. I'll have to think about that one. Thank you, Zach.
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:12.800]   I appreciate your time today. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you, Andy.
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:18.400]   And I go, what are you going to be on GBH next next Friday, 1230 at the Boston Public Library
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:24.160]   Studios? So you can come in and buy yourself a cup of coffee, buy yourself a cookie and watch me
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:29.680]   pretend that I'm not reading off of notes, even though I'm totally reading off. Thank you, Andy,
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:36.400]   and I go.com, WGBH Boston. And of course, Jason Snell, six colors.com/json.
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:42.880]   Plug something one of your many endeavors. Well, since, since Zach got me in the mood,
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:47.600]   just check out the upgrade podcast. We have a good time. I sang some, I discovered that all
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:51.680]   of the classical music I could think of off the top of my head this week was Beethoven. I have no
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:58.960]   idea why it's Beethoven, but it's Beethoven. And I, on earth, a 40 year old memory this week on
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.480]   an upgrade, which was that my piano teacher used to give us those little plastic figurines.
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:07.200]   That's great. With various composers on them. I hadn't thought about that in decades. I posted
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:11.760]   it to Facebook and I immediately got somebody I went to elementary school with who said,
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:15.840]   I had those too. And I also haven't thought about it for 40 years. So, you know, it's just
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:20.400]   safe. Any of them, Jason, or any of them. We have fun. I did not save. I have the piano,
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:26.240]   but I don't have any of the plastic figurines. I'm sorry. Sorry, Chopin. You're in a landfill
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:34.960]   somewhere. Upgrade with Mike Curley. That's the Brit on this one, relay.fm/upgrade episode 450
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:42.560]   Funko classical. Absolutely. I love it. And I thank you all for being here. Have a great time
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:48.640]   at the Cure concert, Zach. That's awesome. Have fun. Absolutely. Yeah. And thank you all for being
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:54.400]   here. We do Mac break weekly, Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time. We are now in
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:30:03.680]   summertime once again. And that means it's 1800 UTC. We didn't. UTC doesn't change. We do. 1800 UTC.
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:07.840]   I reason I mentioned when we do it is because you can't watch us do it live. If you want to get
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:14.240]   the freshest version at live.twit.tv chat with us live at irc.twit.tv. Of course, club
[02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:20.240]   Twit members get to chat inside the discord, which is always a lot of fun. Join us there.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:28.160]   After the fact, easy to get copies of the show. Simply go to twit.tv/mbw. But you'll also be glad
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:32.720]   to know there's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly so you can go there and watch.
[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:37.440]   Good way to share clips if that's what you'd like to do. But probably the best thing to do is
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:42.720]   subscribe in your favorite podcast player. That way you'll get it automatically as soon as it is
[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:50.560]   available. Yes, we've been doing this show a damn long time. So you may we you may not see us at
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:58.080]   the top of the charts. But we're here 861 episodes later. Thank you for joining us. And now for the
[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:04.400]   861st time, I'm going to tell you to get back to work because right time is over. Bye bye.
[02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:10.320]   Oh, hey, that's a really nice iPhone you have there. You totally picked the right color. Hey,
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:16.080]   since you do use an iPhone and maybe use an iPad or an Apple watch or an Apple TV, well,
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:22.400]   you should check out iOS today. It's a show that I, Mike Asargent and my cohost Rosemary Orchard host
[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:28.720]   every Tuesday right here on the Twit network. It covers all things iOS, TVOS, HomePod OS,
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:34.000]   Watch OS, iPad OS, it's all the OS that Apple has on offer. And we love to give you tips and tricks
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:39.600]   about making the most of those devices, checking out great apps and services and answering your
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:45.920]   tech questions. I hope you check it out.
[02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:53.200]   [Music]
