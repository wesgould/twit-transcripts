[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andes here. Alex is here. Jason is here. We're going to talk about some interesting stuff.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.600]   There are rumors. We'll have the usual rumor report. We'll also talk about a reorg at Apple.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.000]   How long will your new Mac be supported? The answer may surprise you. And shocking news.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Apple TV's messy introduction was hit with audio problems.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   But Jason calls it, "It's a stupid story that you get stupider as you go."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We'll talk about that in a whole lot more coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple. And on the news beat this week...
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's the usual suspects. Hello, Jason Snell from sixcolors.com. Good to see you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I walk the beat every day, checking in, "Hey, Mrs. McIntosh, how are things going on? How's Young Newton doing school?"
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And then I moved down the street and out in front of the bar. I'm like, "Oh, here's iPhone and iPad. What are you guys up to?"
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   When I was a kid there was a TV show called The Whistling Policeman, and he had a baton, which he twirled.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Which is actually an hindsight, a little threatening. And he'd whistle and he'd go around through that exact thing. He'd cover his beat.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's right.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Why do they call it a beat? Is he beating his feet on the street? Maybe that's it. Andy Enoco probably knows he's a wordsmith.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It appears regularly on WGBH in Boston. Hello, wordsmith.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Thank you very much. I haven't keeping up my guild's dues. Are you in the WGA?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   No, I'm not. I am SAG-AFTRA, and so I'm leaving right now. No, because I think because, first of all, I'm on a bayon because it was for the radio show.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   As soon as I retired from the radio show, I said, "I don't want to pay dues anymore. It's like 300 bucks a year."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And I said, "Can I just be on a bayon?" And they said, "Yes." So maybe I don't have to strike. And secondly, we're not a signatory.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So I wouldn't be striking myself. I mean, just to be safe, Jeff, you should probably just do this as Jeff Myers, not as you're Leo LaPoure.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Oh, hi. Like when Calvert de Forest had to stop being Larry Budmelman when Letterman went to CBS?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   That's hysterical, because they owned Larry Budmelman. Right.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Holy cow, I didn't know that. That's interesting.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Also with us, Alex Lindsay, he's a video Smith. 090.media is his day job. Well, I shouldn't even say that.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   He spent some time there, but most of the time he's at office. I was stuck close to my day job.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's a day job. It's still a solid, a solid, full-time job on top of the other full-time job.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yes, exactly. He's got two. That's the key.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Was this an error? Or just as we came on the air, I was told that Big Sur was updated and it really scared it.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   What? I don't understand.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   That would be a security update if it's anything.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's a public beta czar out now. They came out, in fact, I think as we ended the show last week.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's a few things don't work, but it's not bad.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Look, I have written many paragraphs over the years warning people in various ways about not installing betas on their main systems because they might regret it later.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I'm not sure if you're going to find out about it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Apple certifies this as a public beta.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Apple is like, "Yep, go to it if you want."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   All I've reduced it to is check to see if the thing you've depend on for your livelihood.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Make sure that that still runs.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Beyond that, if you want to get the stuff early and you're willing to deal with a few bugs, go for it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Have fun. Apple says it's okay, basically.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   They came back and just a few little weird things like that.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's a good thing.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Also, iPadOS 17, I should do that because I have a couple of iPads.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Now, Sonoma is out in its public beta as of July 12th.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Same thing, same rule. I guess so.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's the developer ability you want to stay the hell away from.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The fact that Apple, of all companies, is saying this is a public beta.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   We want everybody to see this.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It means that they really do want to get the value of as many people as possible trying it.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Although, what Jason says is absolutely true.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   At least wait a few days to find out, like, to read the news to find out, "Oh, well, it turns out that it works."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The only apps that don't work with it are the kinds that take keyboard input.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Other than that, it's solid.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   If you've got projects that involve keyboard input, you might want to stay with it.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   That's, by the way, a hypothetical.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   There isn't actually an keyboard problem, just so you know.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   What's great is, ever since Apple, it has definitely been much more stable since Apple has made these public betas.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It's been now quite a few years, but it used to be not that way.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Then everyone was a beta tester when they first got it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So, you're a beta tester now, or you're a beta tester after release.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I think from a production perspective, I've gone back to thinking that the production release,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   like where I'll put it on my computer, is somewhere in January.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Yeah, but you're actually doing work.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I'm just sitting around looking at my phone.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   But I think that for my home computers, I haven't dived into the beta too much.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   We have seen people, I guess there's a lot in the camera effects that are just built in the Sonoma
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   that have surprised a couple folks in virtual meetings,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   because you do a gesture and suddenly all this stuff happens.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's not based on a Zoom camera.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It is in the actual Apple camera, and it doesn't appear to be limited to the camera that's on your laptop.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's managing the web cameras.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Yeah, so I'm using the Opal camera, so not a camera that is from Apple.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   But what Apple is doing in Sonoma, and by the way, back rumors has a really nice post in their forums.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's like a wiki post where people are putting in what's broken and what's not.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Most things are not broken.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But anyway, so it patches into your camera.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So it says, "Oh yeah, this is your camera."
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But what it actually is, is like your camera passed through Apple's software layer
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and then back out to the third party apps.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So it can modify it, including doing all of those reactions.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   So theoretically, if you do a third party reaction, you're going to get it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And this is a third party camera doing it, and it does it anyway.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That also means your third party cameras will get the studio light effect,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   will get the portrait effect, like all that stuff, because Apple is taking it in through
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   its video pipeline, analyzing your video, finding like subject detection and all of that,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   doing layered 3D effects behind, and they're able to do all of that stuff dynamically.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   So that's a thing that we can do now.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Here's the Mac rumors form.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   If you go to the forums, go to iOS 17, you'll see these wiki posts, and you can go to, for instance, iOS 17.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   All the little things.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   That's really a nice feature.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I like that.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And if you find something that's broken, so they're, yeah, they've got the supported,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   unsupported apps post on Mac rumors for Mac OS 14.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That's a good one too.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And that's, that's the post that will tell you before you, you know, will the mission critical thing
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   that I absolutely need to have, or I will lose my job.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Is it there, or is it not there?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And so it's just, it's good.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Like if you rely on audio hijacker, you rely on crossover or something like that, you know,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   you might have some issues, but most people won't.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Yeah, very nice.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So this is the article, and I thought it a little odd, but I had checked the date and it is July 18th, 2023.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Apple issues release candidates for iOS 15.7.8.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   iPadOS, Mac OS, Big Sur, and Monterey.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So you think these are like, why would they, they're bigger than just like the, the, the
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   rapid update security responses?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But they are, so Apple is committed.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   There's actually a really good article.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Oh, we're going to talk about that.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Yes.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   About the idea of like, how long is a Mac on the, on the OS update train?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   How long does that last?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And when will the last Intel Macs fall off of it?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And Apple's policy is basically a, oh, yeah, it's an R story, right?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That's right.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So basically the idea here is that you're on the train for a while.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And then, and then you fall off of it.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And what happens is you don't fall into the wheels and die.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   What happens is your Mac on the, on its old OS that it can't update from is still updated
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   for a couple of years for not features, but for like security fixes and maybe compatibility
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   fixes.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So they, they keep a longer stretch.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   So if you're too back on, so Big Sur is a good example where Big Sur is getting close to,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   closer to the end, but it's not at the end yet.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   So they'll do ultimately, you know, you'll take Big Sur and Ventura and Big Sur is one back
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   now about to be two back, right.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And so you get your moment.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I think it goes, it goes, you want to run between.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Right.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   All right.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So Big Sur is basically, this is fixing, the fixing to die, pining for the few words.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Really some big sir.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   That means that if you can't, if you're running a Mac that can only run as far as Big Sur,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   that's, that's kind of way back and you still are protected.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.080]   But once, once we ship, you know, we get our Sonoma in the fall, Big Sur then goes into
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.520]   the parked permanently category, but you'll still have Monterey and Ventura.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.200]   So it, it's a nice feature that, I mean, as somebody who occasionally buys these Google
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.880]   Pixel phones and then like the next year, they're like, not for you.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   Right.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.960]   But Google, you made it.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.720]   Apple tries to stretch it out, but it does vary as the Andrew Cunningham story pointed out
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.320]   that sometimes you could really luck out and you're supported and on the main OS for a
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   very long time.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   And other times, not so much.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.080]   Actually, yeah, I was surprised that there isn't a set policy because Google has now
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   done that with both Android and, and encourages all Android developers to do some sort of
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.840]   commitment as to the number of years of updates.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.720]   And Chrome books are technically have, I think, eight years.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.040]   So if you buy a new Chromebook today, you're guaranteed eight years from it.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.600]   Well, and this is the thing not from the day you buy it from the day of its release.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.760]   So if you buy a three year old Chromebook, that's going to give you five years.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.920]   Windows is pretty, Microsoft is pretty clear about each version of the operating system,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.320]   you know, 10 years to end of life.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.520]   And then, but Apple is, and this is an interesting article.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:02.240]   I was very interested to Andrew Cunningham's maintaining a spreadsheet on how long each
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.120]   Mac is being supported.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.280]   And it really does vary.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.360]   The average Mac at 6.6 years of Mac OS updates that add new features.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.960]   They're two years of security only updates.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   Right.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.800]   But that's not always the case, depending on the Mac.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.960]   The shortest lived Mac is the 2008 version, the white MacBook, which only got 2.7 years
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.120]   of Mac OS updates and another 3.3 years of security updates.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.200]   So I guess you could say, well, we're pretty sure we're going to have six years and we
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.600]   might have more.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.160]   And then if you transition, like from power PC to Intel or Intel to M1, that changes things
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   a little bit too.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:48.480]   So I would recap this article if I could, but it's kind of hard to see a trend here.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.080]   It's a great article.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.280]   Andrew does really, really good work over there.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.080]   The internet is about this.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.600]   And this is a great example of him doing the math and following the updates.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.040]   And I mean, I think what the Apple does have that policy, but their policy is, you know,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.160]   when your Mac finally is not able to run an update, you've got essentially a couple more
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.960]   years before the security updates don't happen.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.240]   It's not like your Mac stops working, but the security updates stop.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.400]   And I just changed the server out that was running Mojave, right?
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.480]   So I was already off.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.720]   I had fallen completely off at that point.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   It still worked.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.000]   It was just increasingly difficult to work with it because all sorts of new features were
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   launching.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.600]   There are a bunch of features this fall that are coming to notes and reminders where if
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.200]   you've got a device that's not on the latest, it basically says, it's not going to see this
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.520]   note at all, right?
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.960]   It's like, it's just, it's gone.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.080]   You can't see it anymore.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.280]   So there's a lot of pressure that Apple's putting there.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.960]   But the bottom line is you usually are going to get, you know, four or five years where
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.680]   you're on the main line of updates and then you'll get a couple of years grace where you,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.360]   you know, you won't be on the latest and greatest, but you'll be safe and protected.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.680]   And it's not bad.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.440]   But I mean, the variance is if you buy a model that's been hanging out for a long time, the
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.520]   clock has been ticking while you haven't had that computer.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.960]   We also know because of things like open core legacy patch that you can often run older
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.520]   versions of the OS on a Mac, even though Apple doesn't support it.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   So it, I think this is the question.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.680]   Is it planned obsolescence or is it a, is there a real technical reason for this?
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.760]   Of course, we should say nobody expects a company to support anything indefinitely.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.000]   There comes a time when you just don't want it to vote resources to it.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But it is a legit question if Apple's doing this prematurely.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.360]   I think their track record is that they've been doing this.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   I'm always surprised.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.640]   In the last couple of years, they had some big changes with Apple Silicon and with a 32
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   bit thing.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.760]   But like, I'm usually very surprised at how many Macs, old Macs are still supported when
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   they do an update.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.880]   They seem, it looks to me like they only migrate them off when there's a real technical reason
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.960]   when they have to dump them off and not just because they're clock expired.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.880]   And you see that where when a raft of systems goes, you're like, oh, they're all like this.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.400]   They all have this thing that they don't have and they've decided to drop it.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.920]   So I think that they try really hard to keep things on.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.400]   And when they do dump something off and you can do a patch and get it running, generally
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:26.120]   it's because it's kind of janky or it is a missing feature and they've just decided
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.200]   they're going to say no.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.360]   But I think they try to be aggressive.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.200]   But at least that's my impression is they try to keep Macs on the current version as long
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   as they can.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.960]   Is there any reason they don't make a commitment of some kind like as Google has with Chromebooks
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   now?
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.000]   By the way, Google didn't for the longest time and had the same kind of weird update schedules.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.960]   Can we get Apple to do that?
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.680]   I think it's I think it's based because it's not based on time.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.040]   It's based on what feature set that they're building into it and whether they can so it's
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.840]   unpredictable support it.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.920]   So it's just kind of like, well, we can't, you know, that's I think that that's the yeah.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.480]   And again, at some point, I think that they just have to say, you know, like you can't
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.760]   keep on looking into the past.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.440]   So I think that they do keep it going because the current OS also works.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   So remember, it's not like it's for your computer.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.680]   Something that can run Big Sur is something that goes generally further back from Big
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   Sur by years.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   Right.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.320]   So it's don't the the I think they're changing how they approach this too, because it used
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.160]   to be much more like new features come and everybody gets new features.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.120]   And over the last few years, they have changed to a model where you've gotten older Mac that
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.160]   you get the new update, but these three features don't work for you.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.240]   And that's especially happened with Intel Max, but it's not just Intel Max.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.040]   They do this thing where they're like, you know, you need here's a new feature of Sonoma,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.480]   but these max can't use that feature.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.720]   You can use Sonoma, but not that feature.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.280]   And it makes me wonder if their their long game is to try to extend the compatibility
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.680]   window as long as they can.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.800]   But keep reminding you that life could be better.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.480]   And rolling out new features that they're not going to support on those old systems.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.400]   So your system is supported, but the new feature is not supported.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.480]   Also it's still a competitive market that I know that the market from access separate
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.720]   from pretty much everything else.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.040]   But every time that a computer is bricked, like every time a computer becomes useless
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.840]   to somebody and gets replaced, that is a window of opportunity for that customer to
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.200]   buy something else or for them to have someone to talk them into buying something else.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.480]   So it ever very much behooves them to make sure these things have as long a life as possible.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   And if Apple doesn't make explicit promises about how long they're going to be supporting
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.160]   their hardware, it's because they have a really great track record.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:43.280]   I think all of us have that one like sort of mutant like off a really, really old Mac
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.680]   that's still like it's in the kitchen because it looks nice and it's good enough to run
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.280]   a browser and to play YouTube videos.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.480]   We're asked Google on most of their products, particularly Chromebooks.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.080]   They really have to promise school systems that, hey, if you're going to be buying 500
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   of these Chromebooks, we promise that you will be still getting security updates until
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.680]   this date and then it's not going to be ended any earlier than that.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.160]   So that's pretty damn good.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.360]   Yeah, and I mean, I'm still, I got a 2012 right here, Mac Mini.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.840]   It's still cooking away, you know, providing some web pages for me.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.680]   And, you know, and that's the thing is that it doesn't really brick.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.400]   It just means that it's not up to you anymore.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   Right.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.560]   Meaning that meaning like you can, you can no longer does the thing that you need to get
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.480]   done on this because updates to APIs mean that you can't get the latest version of Ulysses
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.160]   or whatever word processor you're using.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.600]   I mean, but yeah, I've got a 2011 like Intel Mac Mini on the other side of the office that
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.160]   as soon as I replace it with like an M2, I thought I'm not going to get the M1 on the
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   way for the M2.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.960]   And now I'm like, oh, the, it might be able to get a better one for the M3.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.320]   But as soon as like I replace it, this 12 year old or 13 year old or 14 year old, this
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.040]   rate Mac is going to still be like, it's going to be a server.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.280]   It might become a dedicated Plex server because it's still pretty good.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.600]   It's pretty nimble at what it does.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.000]   It's just, I just can't use it for the thing that I do every single day.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.480]   I think actually one of the big challenges that Apple's going to have is that the M1s
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:16.000]   and M2s have so few moving parts and they are so, so much more powerful than what most
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.960]   people buying them need.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.920]   Like I'm just amazed at how much an M1 will do on its own that the upgrade path for that
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.880]   could be very, very, very long.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.960]   Apple already learned that with the iPad in a similar situation, didn't they?
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.800]   People don't upgrade their iPads.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.640]   I'm getting ready to finally get my kids some new iPads, but they've had the first Pro1,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:42.160]   which was 2015 or 2016, and they've been happily using that since it was released.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.280]   It has to do with, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the, and this is
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.120]   where Apple I think could maybe improve things is that the app developers are just not doing
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.040]   anything that pushes the hardware that they're not getting to a point where they're reaching
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.520]   the hardware limit.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.160]   It makes me wonder if in the Apple Silicon era, we might see extended compatibility if
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.360]   one of the reasons they're shifting to this like you get it, but not all of it approach
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:13.080]   is that maybe Apple Silicon Max will stay on the latest version for a really long time,
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.480]   but with some features as they come in that they're like, "Mmm, not this feature for you,"
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   but you get to stay on.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.720]   And I would love that because what that means is that you're on the mainline security update
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.840]   flow and you're on the APIs that everybody expects, which means your software is not
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.600]   going to degrade.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.280]   And your iCloud stuff isn't going to partially break because some systems are, you know, all
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.720]   that stuff stays the same and it's just that, "Oh, that whizzing new video effect isn't
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   there."
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.440]   And I think that would be a much better approach, like keep people on the mainline without some
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.480]   of the features that don't work as well or require a bit of hardware that wasn't in
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.400]   the M1 but is in the M2.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.600]   Like, I hope that's where they go with this so that even five, six years out, they're
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.320]   still on the mainline even if they're missing some of the marquee features.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.200]   There is one area in which I think Apple could improve that, again, they build the hardware
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.840]   so damn well that they have these machines that are 10, sometimes 15 years old that are
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:12.160]   still like I have an iMac that is 15 years old that I would love to find a use for.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.520]   I'm running Chrome OS on it because it's the easiest thing to do with it.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:22.880]   I wish that they took the extra effort to make it really, really easy to like locate
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:29.720]   old versions of operating systems and do clean installs on older Macs that pre-date.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.440]   That really cool just, "Hey, just hold down a button and we'll be able to get you going
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.000]   via network."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.360]   It's not true for everything.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.560]   It used to be, there was at least like an FTP site that, you know, if you do the secret
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.360]   handshake, you could download and make an installer media for pretty much anything that
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.160]   has an Apple logo on it.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.200]   Apple doesn't have to do that no more than like GM has to support a 1950s car, but it
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.080]   would be nice given that they do have machines that they don't look like they were made
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.760]   out of animal skins and twigs.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.960]   They're still very modern and still capable and so long as it runs a web browser pretty
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.320]   sprightly, it could be super, super useful in the kids' room or whatever.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:16.200]   I mean, Andrew makes a point that you could always put Chrome OS on an old Mac or Linux,
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.000]   but he also says it would be kind of nice if you could keep these things running Mac
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   OS for a little bit longer.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.400]   As you said, like us as a server and things like that.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.760]   Linux is, I mean, look, I guess if you wanted Linux, you should start with Linux.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.600]   And if you buy a Mac, you should assume, "Well, you know, I'm buying a kind of a premium product
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.800]   that is going to be obsoleteed in six to eight years."
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.440]   Yeah, except, I mean, I think we're overstating it.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   I really do.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.920]   Like I was running that Mojave server.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.800]   I think the security is an issue, so like running something and actively using it and doing your
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   email on it and browsing the web and all of that.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.040]   But there are lots of other uses for these things that are on your local network.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.600]   You're not actively using them.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.920]   You're running them as a server.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.120]   You're just writing documents and all of that.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.120]   And they don't stop working.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.800]   I mean, I could literally write articles.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   I couldn't browse the web.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   That's the point.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   The hardware continues forever.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   I can write articles on that iMac.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   Right.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.240]   So, like most of these old computers back here is actually the introduction of mandatory SSL
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   on every website because they don't support it.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.440]   And so you need a proxy and it's too bad.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.400]   But otherwise, like Word 4 runs great on that 512 that I've got back there.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.920]   Word 5 will run excellently and I guess Word 6 never ran excellently, but it ran on that
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.240]   iMac G3 back there.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.360]   Like they still work, but like you do give up the security of the internet.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.840]   The internet you give up.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.320]   Well, in this case, it's like the exploits and your safety on little slightly more modern
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   ones.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.640]   It's your safety for a little while, but it's not like they aren't usable.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.000]   And honestly, unless you're a target, it's probably not even an issue for your safety.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.960]   And keep in mind, after you fall off the train, you've got a couple of years of security updates
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   on top of that.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.000]   And we've seen this with Windows too.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.640]   And then the browsers start to say, oh, well, we're not going to support this older version.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   So really, yeah, they're still usable as long as you know, as long as you air cap them
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   from the internet.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   That's kind of it.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.960]   The only server is a great use.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   And also, well, there's not a great user or something like that.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.000]   Oh, unless you mean like in a house only access.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And how's only server?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.200]   Actually, actually, server would be a good use because you could probably you'll probably
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.840]   be able to do a homebrew update to Apache forever.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.560]   That's just you don't want to use that to go out browse piracy websites or something
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   like that.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   You probably be in trouble then.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.560]   Actually, side note.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.320]   I keep reading up on trying to keep current on the Hackintosh movement.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.400]   And that's one of the greatest successes of Apple Silicon is that it made Hackintosh
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.440]   in a lot less necessary because, hey, now we've got the really super hot fast ones.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.360]   But one of the other things that it does oddly enough is you can Hackintosh a Macintosh
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.960]   to run a later version of the operating system than what Apple supports.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.640]   And that's definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's an interesting application
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.560]   of what shouldn't be an outdated technology.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:12.640]   Well, and that's also the open core legacy patcher, which is you can't I haven't played
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.000]   with I should probably.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.720]   But I'm one of those guys who gets rid of the old stuff and just uses new Macs anyway.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   It's fine.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   It would be fun.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.840]   But you can't patch it once you do that open core.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.760]   What does that what does that mean now in terms of using that Mac?
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.440]   I can go online, obviously, but I should probably not take updates from Apple or is that not
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   the case?
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   I don't know.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   I don't know.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   Thanks.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.320]   Some of them update as normal and others if Hackintosh experiences any indication you
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.440]   would basically run the update and then repat.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.440]   You have to rehack it.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.200]   You'd run the update and then and then attach that drive to another system and run the patch
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.640]   on it and then and then update it depends on how how bad it is.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.320]   But I mean, here's a thought experiment that I haven't even considered, but I'm just going
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.880]   to throw it out there, which is when will an M1 MacBook Air fall off the update train
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.640]   completely?
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:08.840]   And putting this in perspective, I wonder if it's like in the 2030s, right?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.760]   Or maybe late 2020s, but like, I don't know, like an M1 Mac, I can see it's.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.000]   I can go to 2030s.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Okay.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.840]   So this is though, that's the point is that Apple may say, well, yeah, but people aren't
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   upgrading.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   We're going to have to, you know, obsolesces these, even though technically we don't have
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:32.040]   to counter argument would be the iPhone where Apple has shown great success in trade in
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   terms.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.400]   And in growing their install base by getting people to buy new systems, bringing old systems
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.640]   back or handing them down and increasing the total number of iPhones in use.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.920]   And you could make that same argument for Max and Apple Silicon Max is the, the, the people
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.480]   who want to buy a new Mac will do so.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.800]   But if that M1 Mac is still viable, it can go to someone else.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.480]   And now the Mac market is that much larger.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.000]   And I think they do want to do that to a certain interest.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.920]   I don't think apples at the point now where they feel like they have to obsolete their
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.040]   computers because there's no growth potential.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040]   Right.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.960]   So Apple's market share for the Mac is still so small that I think Apple really does believe
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.560]   they can pick up a lot of new users.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:17.480]   And maybe one way you do that is by getting a refurbbed M1 Macbook air for 699 in the hands
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.040]   of people who are never going to buy a Mac otherwise.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.000]   Jim or B, do we, we have old Intel Max line around, right?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   We use those.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   The thing running my stream deck is, and it's air.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.240]   It's not on the internet.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.760]   It's just sitting there.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.680]   Do we have some that you can't update like they're stuck on Snow Leopard or, or Big Sur?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.000]   And, but we don't, and we don't put those on the internet.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.920]   We just, well, they're internal towards it.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   They're internal.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   They're on our network.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.560]   They're on the lamb, but they're not on the interweb.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.560]   This is a good use for it.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.760]   I got a little mini stream deck here attached to, it's an old Mac laptop, right?
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.080]   The problem in a company, we're, we're a Mac, pretty much a Mac company.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.200]   There's a lot of olds, you know, in Mac minis and MacBooks line around.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.840]   We had a bunch of 2015 MacBooks.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.480]   Boy, I really wanted to keep those running forever.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.080]   What year is this one?
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   2013.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   2013.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:24.560]   I'm running myself right now, unbeknownst to me, a 2013 MacBook.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.280]   What poor soul had to use that?
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.840]   Well, look.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.040]   You want an old Mac mini?
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.760]   See, I, I am at the point now where I don't even want to buy anything with Intel in it,
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.000]   even in a Windows PC.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I got, yep.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I got one of those.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.560]   Yeah, you got three of them.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.640]   If it's a, these are, by the way, you know how we use these?
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Set dressing.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:51.000]   Actually, if I had, if I had that many and or like, if I, if I was at the MIT flea market
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.400]   and someone had a box of them that I could make an offer for, I would use them as like
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.000]   shelving supports, like cinder blocks.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.880]   I'd like to support like my servers and those.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.160]   That's a great idea.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.480]   Would you have it, you'd have it poured out, right?
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.120]   Look at those ports.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.600]   That's when a computer was a computer.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.360]   I probably, I probably alternate levels where.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Ports out ports in ports out ports in.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   Look at that.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.560]   I just need all I need is a, a door and I've got a, I've got my workstation or a speaker
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   stand.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   Look at that.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   There's like that.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   Perfect.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   I'm close.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   Oh my God.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.560]   It's a really good driver's.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.440]   It just, it hurts me a little bit.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   It's not just Apple.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.880]   It's everybody that we make these devices that because they're solid state for the most
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.200]   part, they're just never going to wear out and they're just going to end up in landfill.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   And it's, I mean, it's beautifully machined, aluminum and it's beautiful.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.760]   I would say a lot of my machine, a lot of my stuff, I still use a lot.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   Good.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   Like, I mean old stuff.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.760]   Good.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.040]   I have an, I have an old Apple TV that I have updated that I travel with.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.600]   It's just one of my older Apple TVs, but it has all my, it does it.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.280]   It works just fine.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.320]   And you know, when I went to the shore a couple of weeks ago, I just literally plugged it
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.880]   into the, into the, into the system.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.520]   And now I have my system.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.600]   Like I don't have to, you know, like I don't have to deal with their, the Blu-rays or whatever
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.920]   that's at the shore, you know, at the, at the rental house.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   And, and so the thing is.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   Are you going to Jersey?
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.920]   Where are you?
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   When you say I'm going to the shore.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.920]   Cape Cod.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.120]   A couple of weeks ago, I went to Cape Cod.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   Now I, my family goes to Hatter's.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.800]   Oh, it is the shore.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.120]   You're going down the, down the, uh, no, we went.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   We got back here.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.120]   The barrier.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.120]   When we were here, we didn't have a show.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.120]   That's great.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.120]   But that's cool.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.120]   You all went to Hatter's.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.920]   Look how this is yellowed compared to this one.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   White.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.200]   Black good white is hard white is all, you know, white plastic is super hard to keep
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   white.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   He just doesn't stay that way.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   Why you shouldn't buy.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.000]   Probably it's my face makeup that's getting on it, to be honest.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.800]   How, how old is that?
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.240]   I don't know what is, what is it?
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.600]   This one's got like, is burned on the bottom.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   I don't know where this was.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.520]   Let's call that an Intel birthmark.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.200]   Is that the score mark for where the chip, the processor was?
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.320]   Holy cow.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.480]   This one sold has a VGA port on it.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.720]   Oh, that's, that is really old.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.520]   Or it always at.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.720]   That's a TV or is that like, TV?
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   No, it's TV.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   You're right.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   Andy said DVI.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   You're right.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.960]   Even then he's been dongle for the, for VGA.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   Wonderful.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.720]   The same, is it still the same vertical?
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.080]   I mean, not vertical, but is it still the same size?
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.760]   Yeah, it's identical, which is a statistical stack.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.560]   Oh, not as the new new one, but as the old, as many of them, though, the new one isn't
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.560]   this shape.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.280]   No, that's what the footprint is.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.840]   It's larger than the new ones.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.000]   It's like a pancake.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.360]   They flattened it a little bit.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   I've launched it.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   That's it, Pro.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   This is the, yeah, this is the high end of the last Intel, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh,
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   Oh, oh.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   You know, 2018.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.120]   So still viable other than, you know, I was keeping up Mojave, but that's because I wanted
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   to have a 32-bit compatible version and I was stubborn.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.400]   I could've just updated it.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   For your 32-bit.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.120]   In 10 years, I'm going to boot it and I'm going to be like Mojave, what?
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.280]   It'll be here.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.840]   I love it.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.320]   So this, we're going to put this one aside with a little Intel birthmark.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.640]   I think that's a, that's a vintage.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.840]   And this one, John has been very, you're good, Johnny.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:29.120]   He's got, it's Mac OS Lion running on this one.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.600]   He's made a note of the OS and everything.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   We'll take a little break.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.520]   Come back with more, Andy Inako, Alex Lindsey, Jason Snell, a great panel.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.320]   Talk about anything to do with Apple.

[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   There were four of these Mac minis, stream sources.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.400]   Oh, this was streamosaurus.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.160]   So John has just posted a picture.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.440]   And did Colleen built this originally?
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.200]   It was in a little, I remember, it was in a like rolling TV stand or something like
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.240]   that.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.480]   And you said it was in general?
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   Random.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   Random.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.000]   Alright, let me look at our slack here.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.160]   Yes, we still use slack.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.600]   Oh, wow, look at this.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.280]   This was, and this is probably the one that was burned.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.720]   We had, so we had, because we would feed a bunch of different sources, you know, you
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.040]   stream and YouTube and I can't even remember all the different places.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.000]   YouTube was later.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Bit gravity.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Bit gravity.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.560]   I remember bit gravity.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.000]   There were at least four.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.960]   And Justin TV before it was Twitch.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:28.160]   And so each one of these would have a dedicated Mac that would, we would feed the video into
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.320]   Colleen built all that.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   And they were sitting in like a, it was like a TV, one of those rolling TV things.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.720]   Those were the days and the early days of the show.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   Eight, what is that?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   15 years ago.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   When, when one nice thing about the really old ones though, they're not account locked.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.080]   Like that's, it kind of stinks that like, oh yeah, you go on eBay trying to buy like
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:55.320]   second-hand equipment and say, oh, wow, M1, M1 with one terabyte for only like starting
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   bid, $25.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.080]   Oh, it's account locked.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.680]   So it's for parts only like God damn it.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.080]   And Burke says that wasn't a TV table.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.280]   That was a server rack with wheels.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Was it?
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Oh, this Mac, this Mac mini.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   The one in the picture is still working.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   This is number four of the three.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   I have three that are not working on my table.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.520]   Hub that, that, that thing that has, what is it?
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:36.920]   98 in and 189 out or look at this and it, and it feeds a, an ancient, oh, you just turn
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   it off.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   It's not locked.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.080]   It's not locked.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.200]   It feeds an ancient, look at the bezels on this iPad.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.880]   It's a 30 pin, right?
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.280]   I don't know.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   I can't.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.120]   It doesn't slide to unlock.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.640]   I don't even know how that works.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.600]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.600]   And that's the, that's the software that's running on that Mac mini and feeds the iPad.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:06.120]   So I can, so like if I, if I were right now to like Leo, Leo single and I've heard to
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.960]   tap that and make it point out like outside, it would change it.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   Wow.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.560]   This is a lot better than that, that TV stand with the four X.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   Wow.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.000]   This, how old is this one?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.720]   This running the video hub.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   It was a set.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.440]   It was a set, it was a set of four.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.640]   How come one is so burnt up?
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.800]   It must have been on the, on the top shelf where all the heat was.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   Okay.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.320]   That's why there's three here and one still in service.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   Moving along.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.320]   I'm free.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.320]   Get one free.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   What a deal.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320]   We probably did get a quad pack.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   That was back in the day.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:51.720]   Alex, Alex, Travis was managing the downtown, uh, back Apple store and we would go in there.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:57.520]   I remember standing out on the corner with Scott Born out on market and whatever that
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:07.640]   street was and he had like seven, he had a, a dolly with like seven computer boxes stacked
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.320]   up and I remember standing there.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:17.720]   People would drive by and go, Hey, Hey, would you just, just buy out the store?
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.880]   Apple has done something interesting according to Mark German.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   I don't know.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   It does.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.360]   I don't know enough about Apple to know.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.920]   It's a shift away from Steve Jobs approach.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:39.800]   Uh, Steve had reorganized the company along functional lines, which is kind of an interesting
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.120]   thing to do.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.840]   You had software engineering, you had hardware, you had machine learning, design services,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.120]   and then according to German contributions from each group would then funnel into new
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   features and products.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.640]   So in other words, there wasn't a Mac group.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.560]   There wasn't an iPod group.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:04.040]   Steve did that in the late nineties, but Apple apparently is going back to the old battle
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   days.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.040]   If it is, are they the battle days?
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:15.200]   The vision pro headset, for instance, has its own now group, the vision group and, uh,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.600]   and they're kind of responsible for the whole hardware thing.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   Is this meaningful?
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   I don't know.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:29.280]   Mike Rockwell, who's a long time Apple guy, um, is, was, was running the technology development
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.080]   group since 2015, but it is now called the vision products group.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.040]   Yeah, it's literally, they just renamed it because it's the group that was built, building
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.520]   the headset all along.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.280]   So I'm not sure how newsy this is.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.960]   Also the watch was done this way.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.240]   So now part of the watch development, the watch software development is still under the group
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.440]   that developed the watch and not directly under Craig Faderie.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.200]   I think it's overstating it to say, Oh, they're going back to the old way.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.560]   Cause that's not really what's happening here.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.440]   It seems like they, they create a group to build a new product.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:06.320]   And then over time, it seems to slowly kind of diffuse back out into the world, but they
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.800]   didn't send up an iPhone group or an iPad group or a Mac group.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.400]   It's more like with the watch, like the software is still sort of in the watch group.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.880]   The hardware has gone to their hardware group.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:22.640]   And I imagine the vision, OS stuff will probably similarly slowly kind of spread out until
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.160]   it makes sense to hand it off.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:30.080]   But they do seem this is for secrecy, is it for secrecy that they, they partition off
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.560]   the, I mean, they're, they probably didn't want anybody to know what the vision group
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.200]   was doing back in 2015.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   Sure.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.640]   I'm sure it was partially for secrecy, but it's also just functionally you got, you got
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   a ship.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.280]   You got, you can't not ship anything for five years, right?
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.680]   So you got to ship your iOS updates and your Mac OS updates and all of that in the meantime,
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.840]   plus have a bunch of people who are working with their heads down saying, you know, you're
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.840]   not, nobody's going to see this until 2024.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.880]   You're just going to have to work on it.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:59.080]   And so I think it serves both purposes, but it's almost like the Tim Cook area is sort
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.000]   of hacking, like jobs was like, we got to simplify this.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   And so he did.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.160]   Tim Cook is sort of like, well, yeah, but now that we're launching this new platform and
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.680]   I don't know how the iPhone was done.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.560]   I imagine the iPhone was at least initially done very similarly in the iPad for the watch.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.120]   So we're going to have a group working on the watch and then they will sort of like
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   start to dissolve into the greatness of the big Apple soup, I guess, in the middle there.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.800]   Apple soup sounds not very good.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.360]   No, there's delicious apple soup.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.520]   That's what's going with vision.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.880]   Oh, it's made with Apple and not not vision pro headsets.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.280]   No, I wouldn't make a freak.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   It's yuck.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.960]   You're not eat iPad.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.720]   Do not do not eat it.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.480]   And Gurman writes, if the vision products were developed in standard Apple fashion, the software
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.880]   engineering for the headset would have been led by Craig Federighi and his software engineering
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.400]   organization, the hardware would have been developed alongside Apple's other devices
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.040]   under John Turnis.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.600]   The content arm would be with edIQ services.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   So but it makes, you know, I think Tim Cook, you could safely say is an operations genius.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.200]   And if he thinks it's going to work better in a different way, do it that way.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:12.720]   Steve, remember that Steve came back to, or actually before he left Apple, raised the
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:19.160]   pirate flag on a building down off in the corner of infinity, one infinity and developed
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.120]   the Macintosh completely separate from the rest of the company.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.280]   And so that might be his heritage more than it is the right way to do things.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   And of course, that was his stick in the thumb in the eye of the Lisa group.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   Right.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.720]   This was like, we're going to steal everything from every other project.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   Right.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.200]   And that was like a model that kind of was sinking Apple.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.000]   It just as it was weighing down Microsoft and other companies, we have the heads of divisions
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.080]   that basically consider themselves as independent fifdoms and scrambling to remove resources
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   from other divisions because they feel like, Hey, if this other division gets an extra
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.720]   $12 million, that $12 million could have been to me.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.480]   I need to undermine their work as much as possible.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.160]   And that's simply not the culture at Apple.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.320]   So that's not, it's not alarming.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   It's interesting.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.560]   One of the most famous things about Apple's management structure is that every, every
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   week you have the weekly meeting of like all the division heads, basically doing a wrap,
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.120]   doing a state of the state of the company on all the different product developments.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:24.440]   And basically there's no one division holding on to all of their ideas, at least at the
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.720]   very, very highest level, there is there is conversation between different parts of the
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   company.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:35.840]   But if one decision made by engineers or made by a manager is going to impact another product
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.640]   or another thing or another schedule, that gets borne out really quickly and settled.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.680]   So yeah, I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:48.720]   It'll be interesting if the upcoming products took on this model.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.040]   I don't think it will.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.720]   Herman says that the self-driving car team has run this way too.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.120]   They're kind of a stand stand.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.600]   And that's another product.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.120]   That's another product that has no schedule.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   It has no agenda.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.640]   I don't know when it's going to be.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.920]   Just like the VR headset was the Apple vision was going to be.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.720]   We don't have a target for it.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.760]   Even when we released it, it's not really the thing.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   It's the thing we're releasing because we need to release something.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.240]   So maybe that's just the simplest way to get things, iterate really, really quickly and
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   get done the things you need to get done without feeling as though, yeah, we had a conversation
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.000]   with Josh and he was saying he saw a really good sketch of a car with like an extra wheel
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.280]   on the back and we could make that a GPS like, yeah, that has nothing to do with anything
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.160]   we're working on to down shut up.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.280]   Yeah, there's a fine.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.400]   I mean, it's almost like a what's the sound of one hand clapping kind of thing.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.160]   But like what's the difference between going to Craig Federighi and saying, we're working
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.400]   on a thing.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.200]   I need you to create a group of your best engineers to write the software for the thing
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.400]   and they will work in secret.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.280]   But technically they'll be they'll report to you, but a dotted line to me, but they'll
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.840]   report to you and saying we set up a group and got a bunch of engineers that are in
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.800]   the group and Craig will check in with them because it's all based on iOS anyway.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.520]   So of course, Craig is going to be involved.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.920]   Like I feel like this is the way Apple is structured.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.840]   It's kind of a distinction without a difference.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.440]   You need a dedicated team to work on a future product.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.640]   It's going to be not distributed to everyone because they're going to want to keep it a
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   secret.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.880]   They want to want to focus those people, but you can't you also can't like the way Apple
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.040]   Apple's assets are laid out.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   Like it's all going to be based on iOS.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.760]   If they need a framework change, the framework engineer is going to need to change it, right?
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   So they're all kind of working together, but there's going to be a subgroup that's working
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.120]   separately.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.200]   Does it matter where they are on the org chart?
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   I don't know.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.400]   I'm sure there are many management theories and books have been written about the best
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.440]   way to handle this.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.760]   You nailed it, Andy, when you said it almost killed Microsoft that they had these fiefdoms.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.280]   That's definitely what you don't want.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.520]   So I'm sure there's a lot of theory behind this and I'm sure this is the state of the
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   art.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.000]   I don't think Apple's probably immune to internal disagreements about how to execute something.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.720]   No, but good leadership resolves that rather than letting the story of Microsoft was the
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.280]   Windows team wouldn't let Office come out on any other platform.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   I mean, there was all sorts of this shooting in each other, that famous cartoon of every
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.720]   division of Microsoft pointing a gun at the other division.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.640]   I think that there's an advantage to having a team that is, let's say, 85% contained from
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:32.040]   a security perspective, from a lack of bureaucracy perspective, but that last little bit.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.840]   The danger is, again, that not only is it people competing with each other, but it's
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.080]   also just not knowing what the other ones are doing.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:46.440]   When the Canon Mark II came out, it was 30 frames a second, not 2997.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.040]   When someone asked, "Why is it not 2997?"
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.120]   Why can't you do 2997 on this camera?
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.280]   Well, still camera division was not allowed to talk to the video camera division.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.680]   They didn't do anything about 2997.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.600]   They just knew, "Well, 30 frames a second seems good."
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.520]   So those are the kind of things that you get when it gets too vertical, but I think that
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.160]   you can get into a ton of, "Where is this engineer going to work today?
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.360]   And who is he working for?"
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.840]   Things get slowed down because someone's pulling a hand, shared resources in like six different
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   directions sometimes.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:27.960]   I have an autographed copy of Man of Cornette's famous org chart cartoon on my home.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.040]   You can see Microsoft, all these little groups pointing guns at each other.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:37.440]   When he did this some years ago, Apple had a center, which the Red Hot Center was Steve
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.320]   Jobs at the time, and everybody reported to Steve Jobs.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.280]   That's not the case anymore either.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.800]   No company can run that way either.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   All right.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.400]   So I'll continue on with, as long as we're doing the Mark Gurman segment, I will continue
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.720]   on with the power on newsletter.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.800]   He says new Macs are going to be coming a little more detail.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.520]   I remember he was the one who said they're working on an iMac for 2025 that is bigger
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.840]   than 30 inches, but a little more detail on what Apple might be doing this year.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.840]   He's guessing, I think.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:20.880]   I don't know if he has a source on this, that there'll be Mac launches in October featuring
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.400]   could feature, he says, the first max with M3 chips.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.680]   Don't expect high end MacBook Pros or desktops.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   Do expect that.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.920]   I think this matches the cadence that they're on right now, perhaps an iMac, but certainly
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:39.360]   a 13 inch MacBook Air and a 13 inch MacBook Pro with an M3 chip.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:45.840]   I made a note to myself the other day, you may not buy another Mac until it is an OLED
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.760]   MacBook Pro with an M3 processor, but that won't be his fault.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.240]   I don't make myself those promises.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.720]   I have to do it.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.680]   Otherwise, I'll go, oh, that's nice.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.160]   I know heart wants what it.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   You will not say the heart wants it.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   One another.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:07.880]   So it's really the note is more like, the yo, don't buy another one.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.040]   Because that's one of the big rumors.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.920]   And I like that idea of, I think I had a 13 air and a 15 air is my current.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:21.280]   And I'm thinking the 14, I look at Lisa's 14 inch MacBook Pro with envy in my eyes.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.320]   I just don't know how you live with one computer.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.200]   See, the problem with the laptop.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.000]   So when I do, when I do my presentation, I have this presentation.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.160]   I have to do a lot right now.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.360]   And there's like four computer.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.640]   I got, I got one Mac studio and three Mac, Mac minis and all of them are necessary.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.880]   How do you keep them in sync?
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.640]   Do you have a tool that keeps them all doing, having the same documents or is everyone unique?
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.600]   So what I jump on zoom with right now is my Mac studio.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.560]   So that's what I'm talking to someone in.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.640]   But then I have one computer that's my illustrator.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.120]   So that does this part right.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.440]   Just does that little fancier operation than I am.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.960]   And then I have another one that does the power, does key, key note.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.460]   So it just does the presentation.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.960]   So I can always cut to that, you know, so I can cut to the presentation.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.320]   And then I have another one that runs any kind of app or web page that I want.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.160]   And I'm looking at buying one more so I have another app system.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.720]   But what's nice about it now is when that all runs into like an ATEM Extreme, you just
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.400]   sit there and just cutting between them, drawing over top of them.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.720]   I can split screen between them.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.640]   I can, you know, do all those other things that it makes good presentation.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.120]   But I couldn't do it.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.400]   I kept on getting them because like trying to get like, because a lot of things want to
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.040]   take over the whole screen.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   And so I was like, oh, I just, it's just better to just put them on a different computer.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.320]   So I don't have any of those things.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   But it's it.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:41.680]   I will say that the Mac, lots of Mac minis makes especially now makes everything run really
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680]   so nice.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.520]   So what you're saying, Alex, is that in your digital world, your romantic relationship
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.840]   is a polycule.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.000]   What's a, okay, you better.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.360]   Now I'm feeling ignorant.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:53:01.240]   Any polyamorous relationship, the people who are in that relationship, the only, it's a
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:06.640]   newer term are referred to as a polycule where there's, there could be different levels
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.400]   of, of, of emotional connection.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.400]   You might have a.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   Thrupple.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.680]   You might have a quintuple.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.400]   You might have a sex tuple.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.400]   Okay.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.400]   I have a, yeah.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   Don't, yeah, just stop right now.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   I'm going to stop right now.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.760]   I was going to keep going with that with that.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.240]   I, so, so, so all this is creating a space of love and honesty.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.640]   It's just, it's just a harem of Max.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   You know, like a harem.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.640]   There you go.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   Max.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   I've got a harem.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   You don't need not that.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   It's not a polycule.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   It's a harem.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.520]   You're only going to get yourself in deeper.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   That's all I know.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.520]   I'm going to stop now.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.520]   Okay.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.520]   Okay.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.520]   Moving right along.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:52.760]   Let's see with the german segment.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.560]   We should get a little bumper or something.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.960]   And now we, yeah, on upgrade, we call this rumor roundup and we got some art and we named
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.120]   Mark german, the sheriff and, you know, you got to go with it.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   That's good.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   He's the best in the biz.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   Get your own idea of Leo.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   You can't have a rumor around.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Okay.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   Tune in the rumor roundup.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   Yeah, because I have mixed feelings because rumors are not news.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.120]   So I have mixed feelings, but I have to say we're getting into August right now and it's,
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.880]   it's going to get harder and harder to put shows together.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.880]   So rumors.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.880]   I mean, always think it's, I call him reports instead of rumors.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.960]   Honestly, I prefer that because german is so well sourced and he's really.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.880]   He's always right.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.520]   And when he's wrong, he's wrong because it was true at the time and then they changed
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.520]   their mind.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   Right.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.920]   Like it's he's, his accuracy is, it's as close to perfect as you can get.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:44.160]   And so, you know, if you want to know what's happening next, I mean, yeah, we get, we all
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.680]   do the mark german segment.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.920]   We all do it because he is that are that good.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.400]   He's the one with a little sprinkling a minkie quo in there.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   He's my chair.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   That's what you got.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.960]   A little minkie quo for spice.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   He says german does.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:04.320]   I wouldn't expect any major upgrades on the iPad until the m3 iPad pros with OLED screens.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.240]   Tasty arrive next year.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:13.280]   Do expect perhaps an iPad Air update is in development, he says.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.200]   And I think that completes the roundup.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.440]   Basically m3 is in the, I feel like the m3 in the fall thing is the one that I took away
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.800]   from his whole report is like, that's what I'm excited about.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.240]   I, I got a timeline now.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.120]   I'm really, I think we've talked about this.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:36.920]   The M2 was really kind of almost just a slight upgrade over the M1, kind of an incremental
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.840]   upgrade, but the m3 going to the three nanometer process, you could expect to see a bigger
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.040]   performance jump.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.480]   We talked about this last week.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.160]   At right or am I wrong?
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   Or is that just?
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.680]   There's a dice rank.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:55.080]   So it should actually be much more substantive improvement in power and to power efficiency.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.640]   So being short supply, as TSMC is cranking them out as fast as this little machines can,
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:07.520]   but they've already said that, you know, Apple's bought up the entire production.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.800]   Samsung on packed, we should mention given, you know, there, there is no folding Apple
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.280]   phone yet.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.800]   Google's got one.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.320]   There's several companies making them, but the big one is a Samsung phone and the Samsung
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.320]   flip.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.360]   They expect, we expect they will announce new ones on the 26th at 4 a.m.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.960]   Pacific time.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.800]   Now if you now, Andy, Samsung just send me an invite.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.200]   If you're close enough to New York, you could go at 6 a.m. in New York and they've got breakfast
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   items.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:44.600]   That's the, I might, I might be awake for that because I can take like the red eye train
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.240]   to get there.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.160]   There's like all kinds of sleep on the train.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.200]   Have a big breakfast, be nice and losey by the time the, by the time the event starts.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.480]   They say you will get to play with whatever they announce, which is expected to be the
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:03.280]   Galaxy Z fold five and the Z flip five.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.400]   And Germann says fresh tablets, multiple smartwatches, potentially a new version of the Galaxy
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.480]   buds.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:13.640]   I will, I think I'm going to buy a flip five.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.840]   I really liked the flip.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:16.840]   That's the little one.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.060]   It's like a pocket square that unfolds.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:27.620]   I just happen to have in my pocket, a pocket square that is a pocket square that unfolds
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.340]   and becomes a phone.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:36.500]   Have you seen the Apple, anti Apple horror ad that Samsung put out?
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   Did you see that?
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.020]   Yeah, it's a, it's a little bit of a reach.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.060]   It's like, if you see it, you got to hide your eye.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.700]   It's like the ring or something, right?
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.460]   If once you see it, you won't, you will have to buy it.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.940]   And so this is, this is the short version.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:55.940]   I don't know.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.100]   Let me see if I can find the actual.
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.060]   Yeah, this is somebody reporting on it.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:04.180]   Let me see if I can actually find the, it's a parody of like those movies where they're
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.100]   added at the campground search for Samsung Galaxy.
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.660]   Join the flip side.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:14.740]   Join the, join the flip side.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.060]   That was pretty cute.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060]   This is their.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:22.260]   So, remember Samsung is, has been the company that has always been like the attack dog against
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.260]   Apple.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.140]   Like they're the ones who said, Oh, well, there we have a, we have a headphone jack
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   Apple doesn't.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.700]   That's by your losers and we're winners.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.860]   Just don't ask us about whether we're going to have a headphone jack on our phones next
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.820]   year, year after year after year like that.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.980]   So, so she's telling you could turn on the sound.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.980]   Don't wait to stop at the news.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.420]   I'm just going to be committed to their current.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.420]   I like this.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.260]   Oh, I got some other audio going on.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.260]   Huh.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.260]   Hold on.
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.260]   I don't know.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260]   I don't care.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.260]   I don't really care.
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.260]   Forget.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.260]   Okay.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.060]   Oh, I'm running two different versions of the same commercial.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.660]   Now you can, now you can do it.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:00.420]   So she's now seen the flip phone and she says, get out, get out.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.060]   They're hiding their eyes.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.060]   They're running away.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:09.060]   They're running across the beach.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.060]   Something wrong.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:20.660]   I just like, yeah, it's definitely like a, but I'm, you know what?
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   It worked.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.300]   Now I want one.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.820]   Did somebody run through and say, wait a second.
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:30.620]   And this had our wreath zombies.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.300]   Yeah, really.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.620]   That's a good point.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.300]   It's a very odd.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:41.780]   It's like, you don't really want this, but you're going to be sucked into this, you know,
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.100]   you're going to get zombified.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.460]   Is that really what Samsung wants to say?
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.020]   I don't know.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:53.020]   I think, I think they, if they're going to do a horror movie, they should have done poltergeist.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.020]   Like it is.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.020]   It's here.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.020]   Say, come here.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.020]   All are welcome.
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.020]   What toward the light?
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.020]   All are welcome.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.420]   There is peace in the light.
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.420]   I kind of like this one.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.860]   And then at the very end, her phone rings.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.500]   She's got one in your pocket.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.660]   That's he.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.540]   I'm terrified.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:17.540]   There's a Samsung product.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.540]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.620]   You're picking your pick.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.580]   Your device is probably pinging my phone and getting my location and saying it to Samsung
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.820]   who I don't trust.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.940]   Maybe not what they wanted it.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.940]   Communion.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.940]   Yeah, again.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   It's a, it's interesting.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:32.940]   Well shot.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:37.500]   And at least it wasn't, at least it wasn't a, here's a story of a young, young girl who
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.580]   fell down a cravine and hit her.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.580]   That was a true horror story.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.740]   But thankfully she has an apple phone.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.740]   She has survived.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740]   What's the thinking about the poor girl?
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.780]   You've got the spooky fog music as you're trucking into the sight of the accident.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.060]   The worst thing about those was they brought the actual victims back to the scene of the
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:56.060]   crime.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:00.140]   So it was like they were re-traumatizing them.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.180]   That bothered me more than.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.780]   I hope that I hope that they got more than like a year of apple care for free out of this.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.300]   I hope that they got some money.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.220]   Apples TV plus MLS paradise.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:22.860]   A little bit rocked by the messy debut.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.580]   It was a live stream.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.580]   Did you watch it?
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580]   You're, you're, you're.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.460]   I, I, I didn't, not the debut.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.820]   The, the press conference.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.820]   And now it's.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.820]   That he was going to.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   This story is so dumb Leo.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.820]   This story is so dumb.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.780]   And, and if you read it, you get dumber as you read it because it's like this is obviously
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.180]   a black eye for apple.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.900]   It's like, you know, they did a, they did a press conference and a pounding rainstorm
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.220]   and it didn't sound, it sounded a little muffled.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.420]   For like 28 seconds.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   Come on.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   This is the date.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.260]   Like so, but it's not a damper for relationship between MLS and apple.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.260]   Oh my God.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   Without a blow to apples attempt to demonstrate it.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.700]   It's the sense the rain is making a damper.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:06.700]   That's damper.
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:07.700]   Okay.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.540]   Well, the guy who wrote it, Malcolm Owen is Welsh.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.460]   So I think maybe a little Welsh hyperbole snuck in.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.820]   It's a, it's a UK content farm kind of story.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.060]   It's look, this is the internet now.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.060]   You got it.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.060]   You got it.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.060]   You got it.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.060]   You got a nugget effect and you got to spin a whole story about it.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.460]   So you're like, oh, and this is obviously their relationship is now on the rocks and
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:29.100]   this questions the whole messy deal and no, it doesn't get over it.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.100]   No, it doesn't.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:36.740]   But there was, there was about, there was about 30 seconds, 28, 30 seconds of a lot of crowd.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.220]   Obviously what they were trying to do was mix the crowd in.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.740]   So you'd feel the energy of the crowd.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.980]   So they're trying to mix it in didn't work because it's raining and there's a whole bunch
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980]   of mice.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980]   I see that happen all the time.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:48.660]   Even I remember a Grammy Awards where the mix was so bad.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.660]   I hated the music.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.660]   I mean, this, well, that's the issue.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.220]   The issue also has this a lot.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.220]   It's raining a lot.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.020]   And it's like, that's like from a live perspective, well, having a bunch of people walk out with
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.220]   a bunch of mics out in the rain is not something that you want to see.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:08.020]   And it is something that you're like, oh, this is going to be ugly.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:13.300]   And, and so there was a lot of, a lot of, you know, it's a very difficult stream.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.220]   As someone who does a lot of this, what they were doing was very difficult to do well.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.620]   Most people just decide, hey, let's go do it inside.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.060]   But they already had a stadium full of people to do with.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.100]   It's one of the reasons I try to avoid outdoor streams like the plague.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.180]   So, so the.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.100]   And so anyway, the, so I think that rain is a problem.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.180]   They were obviously trying to do something with a mix.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.540]   They very quickly related to it.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.580]   One of the things we do a lot of times we do pre shows, the reason we do pre shows is
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.420]   so that we can do all this correction before the main person comes out.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.820]   And obviously they didn't have much of a pre show.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.340]   They wanted to do a big launch.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.900]   We didn't have all that energy at the beginning.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.660]   And that's the danger of doing that is that you have to make that first 30 seconds, but
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.980]   it sounded like the first 30 seconds or 45 seconds.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.420]   They had it corrected to a reasonably good given that it was raining to a reasonably
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:59.420]   good level.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:03.540]   But, but I think that that was, you know, it literally was seconds of stuff.
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.900]   So what Jason said, I looked at it and I was like, oh, I'm always curious what happens.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.900]   I went and looked at it and I was like, okay, whatever.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.140]   You get dumber as you read it says Jason.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.140]   No, yeah, exactly.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:21.340]   His pull quotes are it's a blow to Apple's attempts to demonstrate it's a competent broadcaster.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.780]   Yeah, sure it is.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780]   It's tweet on Twitter.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780]   Right.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.940]   There's a read as soon as you see numerous tweets on anything.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.660]   Someone on the internet is angry.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.660]   Watch out.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.660]   On the internet is mad.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.660]   It's hard out.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.660]   It's hard out there.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.660]   Apple insider did this.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.660]   Like we've all seen it.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.580]   I mean, there was just a story the other day about how some Hollywood director was taking
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.460]   on a big piece of intellectual property from the past and that literally the people involved
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.060]   were like, that's not true.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.380]   It's like, it's tough out there.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.860]   You get a dollop of something.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.860]   Right.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.180]   And this is you to spin it into a whole big story.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:00.140]   It leads you down the path where you're injecting analysis like this is a blow to Apple's attempts
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   to demonstrate.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.620]   Like, come on, it's not.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:07.380]   But like I get how hard it is out there writing things on the internet to get the picked up
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.380]   in a search.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.500]   This is kind of what we're talking about last week with the, you know, the Pooh verse
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.860]   incentives for YouTube broadcasters.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.860]   Exactly.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.860]   It reigned.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.860]   It was muffled.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.540]   And Miami, who could have foreseen it?
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:26.820]   I did get an email from Blackmagic complaining about our coverage of the Linus Tech Tips coverage
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.460]   of the Apple marketing misfire.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.540]   They wanted us to issue a correction.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.340]   I'm not going to correct Linus's mistake.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.340]   I want to point out.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.620]   Linus said that Blackmagic couldn't replicate their tests.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.620]   Is that not true?
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.620]   Yes.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.660]   It says during the original, this is from a, from a PR person at Blackmagic, during the
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.700]   original Linus Tech Tips video, they claimed that Blackmagic designed and attempted its
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.540]   own testing and had replicated Linus's results.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.580]   This is not accurate.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:04.660]   In fact, Linus has updated the video and provided a correction in their pinned comments.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.980]   We understand you and your guests did not have the proper context when discussing the
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:13.300]   video, but it would be possible to edit those sections to remove these, the in misinformation
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.300]   or add a disclaimer.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.540]   I am going to do what we would normally do, which is correct it a week later and say,
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:26.660]   I guess Blackmagic did not ever do any benchmarking of Apple products.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.780]   And that was, in fact, that was the most damning little bit of that entire story, I thought,
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:35.340]   is that they got a third party who made the tools and they also couldn't replicate Apple's
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.140]   results, which made it seem super fishy.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.500]   And so for them not to say that that's not the case, yikes.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:48.260]   So I stand by my initial comments, which is don't believe anything you see on YouTube.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.420]   That was cool.
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:57.220]   Although, although there has to be at least like a little consideration for how many phone
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.700]   calls, emails, telexes and whatever went between Blackmagic and Apple saying that what
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.700]   the hell?
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.660]   You know, why did you talk to exactly this?
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.780]   This test and say you couldn't replicate it.
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.100]   And there's probably there might there could be something a little bit fuzzy, say, we didn't
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.340]   we didn't we didn't know if we had the right the right data, your own like footnotes were
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.540]   a little bit unclear.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.460]   And there was an agreement that there was enough.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:27.020]   There is enough fuzziness on it that Blackmagic could be convinced to tell wise tactics that
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   tips that we did.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.980]   We are just out here in the far reaches of Sonoma County.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:37.180]   And I but there was such an earthquake at Linus Tech tips, I feel the ripples just gentle
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.180]   ripples out here.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:42.380]   But the source itself like recants then you have to report on the case.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.900]   Yeah, anyway, so I just wanted to be fair to Blackmagic.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.540]   Apparently, they never they did not not replicate the results.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.460]   They didn't even do it the testing.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.460]   So or something.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   I don't know.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.620]   Like go go watch Linus again.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.060]   Give him some more hits.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.660]   He explains it, I guess.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:07.060]   All right, little break here as we continue on Apple losing a big court case in Europe.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.900]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:13.100]   But first a word from our sponsor, the great folks.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.580]   Well, they really are sponsors who sponsor the studio.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:21.180]   They are the naming rights of the Eastside studios, ACI learning.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.820]   And when we first started doing this, I had explained, you already know these guys because
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:29.700]   IT pro who's been doing ads with us for 10 years.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.740]   We're good friends with Tim and Don the founders and love these guys.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:39.940]   IT pro has joined ACI learning and this is a really good thing for IT pro users.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:46.540]   And for all of you who want to get better IT training, IT pro is consistently delivered
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:55.060]   highly entertaining, bingeable video content training you in all of the aspects of IT.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:09:00.380]   And now thanks to their partnership with ACI learning, the number of videos has gone to
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.300]   2200 current hours in their on demand library.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.340]   They're adding new episodes every day in their studios in Gainesville.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:15.100]   ACI learning is a great partner for this because they provide the best world class service
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:20.940]   assisting you as an individual to choose which learning path suits you best all the way through,
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:24.740]   helping you find the right career opportunity for businesses.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.660]   They will help you design a program to keep your IT team up to speed.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:33.260]   If you're an MSP, it's fantastic for MSPs.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:38.300]   They have so many great features like their practice labs, which allows you to actually
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:43.700]   you know practice, but in an HTML5 browser, so you don't need Windows server or Windows
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.180]   clients, you could do it all in your browser on any machine.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:51.660]   The self-paced IT training videos with full transcription so you can read along as you
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:57.740]   watch the certification practice test so you could take the test before you take the test.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.180]   So many people have gone into IT.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.380]   He has such a great field.
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.900]   I'll give you an example from ACI's website.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.660]   From Felipe B, he said, he was talking about Wes who was one of the longtime trainers at
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:09.660]   ITPro.
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.620]   Wes is an awesome instructor.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:15.100]   Now Felipe says, "I came from a PR background.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.100]   He was in public relations.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.340]   He didn't have any IT knowledge, but he decided, "I want to get into IT."
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:26.260]   He says, "I've passed my 220-1101 on July 1st on the first try.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.180]   You're going to start 220-1102."
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.060]   He says, "West manages to explain concepts in a way you understand it very well."
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:37.580]   That's really what's great about the training you get at ACI learning.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:42.220]   And those practice labs, harmlessly practice all what you've learned, but you can even
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:47.420]   use them to test your own setups and your own configurations.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:52.140]   MSPs love it for that reason before you go live with them.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:57.660]   They have practice exam questions from Microsoft, CompTIA, EC Council, PMI, many more, which
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:01.460]   is great because the best way to prepare for an exam is to take some practice exams.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:05.180]   It gets you used to the format, the style, and gives you the confidence.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.100]   Yeah, I know this stuff.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.620]   That's how Felipe passed that exam on the first try.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.460]   Every vendor, every skill you need to advance your IT career or your IT team in one place.

[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.140]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:10.700]   Of Mac break weekly and all the shows we do, the Spanish antitrust watchdog has taken a
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:16.100]   little bite out of Amazon and Apple to the tune.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.780]   No one expects the Spanish antitrust watchdog.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:23.060]   Oh, I'm so glad I gave you that opening.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:30.620]   Apple was fined 143 million euros, Amazon 50 million euros because, you know, this is
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.380]   something I guess it's unique to Europe.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:40.980]   The two companies signed an agreement in 2018 giving Amazon the status of authorized Apple
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:51.100]   dealer and included some clauses that according to Spain affected the online market for electronic
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.340]   devices in Spain.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:57.340]   Probably some exclusives, that kind of thing.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:02.340]   Yeah, basically, this isn't the first time that Apple's faced this in court, not even the
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.060]   first time in the EU.
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:09.420]   Italy also is to define against Apple and Amazon for a little bit less than that a couple
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   of years ago.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.980]   However, interestingly, they of course, both companies fought it and first it was reduced
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.020]   and then it was passed.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:18.820]   It was basically wiped off.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:23.780]   But there is still a similar lawsuit happening in Washington state as a class action that
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.460]   I think was last month.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.700]   It was filed in like October, September or something like that.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:35.300]   Again, again, assuming making this the claim that Apple and Amazon basically colluded to
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:41.860]   keep Apple prices on Amazon at an artificial artificial artificially inflated level.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:46.500]   I think they're saying that, hey, this is 10 prices of Apple stopped went up 10% immediately
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.260]   across the board on Amazon after this happened.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:55.500]   The latest action, nothing's happened with it since the last month when basically a judge
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:00.660]   basically said that, hey, Apple and Amazon both wanted to have this case thrown out.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.780]   The judge said, nope, this case is going forward.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.660]   So now you get into depositions, you get into disclosure and research.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.220]   But the Spanish it was probably going to get elsewhere too.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:16.180]   The Spanish antitrust watchdog said that this agreement eliminated sellers using Amazon's
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.220]   marketplace to sell Apple devices.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.980]   90% of the existing retailers were blocked as a result.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.780]   Honestly, from a consumer point of view, that's a good thing.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:30.020]   I want to buy it from Apple and I want to know it's an Apple authorized reseller.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:32.420]   They were having a lot of problems and they made this deal.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.460]   But it is, I mean, on another level, it is anti-competitive in the sense that it's crowding
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.700]   the third party sellers off of Amazon.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:44.180]   And basically Amazon and Apple made this handshake deal where Amazon gets preferred, but the
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.340]   stuff gets cleared off the story that isn't from the preferred plan.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:55.100]   As a consumer, I think we even said this on an episode recently, like I am more likely
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.900]   to buy a Mac or any other Apple hardware from Amazon now because there was a period
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.580]   worth of super sketchy.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.020]   Now you're getting it from an authorized Apple reseller.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:07.820]   But I can see the argument that that was also too big company, sort of colluding to
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.780]   push other sellers off the store.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:16.140]   I can see that part too, but I do think that it's probably improved the lot of most buyers
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.820]   because they can buy from Amazon with more confidence than there was a dark period where
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.300]   you kind of couldn't do that.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:27.300]   Apple said the agreement was designed to limit the number of counterfeits sold online.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:34.940]   You may remember back in October, a similar case in Italy was brought and the with a proposed
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:38.700]   200 million euro fine, it was eventually dropped.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:44.300]   So Apple, of course, in Amazon will appeal this and who knows what the outcome will be.
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.460]   That's a big fine, $218 million in total.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.540]   But I'll flick that off the outside.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.220]   That's like a how much I made yesterday.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.220]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:01.220]   But that's like when you hear about the nephew of an ambassador in New York who just simply
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:05.260]   or nephew of a billionaire who just parks wherever they want in New York and just pairs
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.340]   up the parking tickets because not only the $100 parking ticket means nothing to them,
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:13.660]   but like the $800 in fines for not paying it doesn't matter to them.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.420]   So I don't know whether this is right or wrong, but as usual, I'm glad that at least they
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:23.540]   have to defend the reactions in court because that means that if they're going to be dissuaded
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.500]   from doing sketchy things in general, if they said, "Well, we're going to have to talk
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.140]   to a judge and say this was okay, how did we actually structure this deal so that it
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:38.060]   doesn't do the things that these people are claiming it does?"
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:45.420]   The Supreme Court is also in the news, speaking of court actions.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:50.340]   Apple, Reuters says Apple has been chided.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.340]   Chided.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.980]   It was that word.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.780]   He said it was that word.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.020]   Apple chided by appeals judges.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:05.300]   It heads to US Supreme Court in anti-trust case says Reuters.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.980]   This was yesterday, US Appeals Court judge criticized Apple over legal arguments it made
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.780]   as it prepares to ask the US Supreme Court to strike down the ruling that would require
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:19.020]   Apple to change how the App Store payment practice works.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:24.100]   Judge Milan Smith of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said, "Apple
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.460]   had made statements in its bid for time to appeal to the Supreme Court that, quote, "may
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:35.260]   not be technically frivolous but that ignore the factual record and the rulings and the
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.740]   case."
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:42.020]   Smith did get into other judges on the panel to give Apple 90 days to file a petition,
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:49.780]   pause the ruling on payments through Apple plans to go all the way to the Supreme Court
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:57.140]   the Ninth Circuit upheld a judgment that said Apple cannot ban links within apps that direct
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.460]   consumers to payment options outside of the App Store.
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:04.660]   So you know this because if you have the Kindle app, for instance, or the Audible app, there
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:10.620]   is no link to push you to the Audible store on the web or the Amazon Kindle book store
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:15.180]   on the web because Apple forbids that.
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.700]   And why would companies do that?
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:21.260]   The 30% sales commission, if you buy the book on the web, they don't have to give Apple
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.660]   a third.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.740]   Fortnite sued, Fortnite maker Epic Games sued, of course, over this.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:32.940]   This is the one area where Epic won.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:39.860]   So Apple doesn't like the Ninth Circuit's ruling, but the Ninth Circuit did give them 90 days
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:47.580]   to prepare an appeal before they are forced to actually do this.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.740]   Anything to say about that?
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:52.340]   I know how you feel, Alex Lindsay.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.980]   I think you're chiding Apple as well, are you?
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.380]   I know, I'm just saying that it's...
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.860]   No, you're chiding Epic.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:18:59.860]   Going through the courts.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.620]   The courts is the direction.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:08.060]   I'm much more comfortable with it going through the courts than having Congress trying to write
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:13.220]   some law that will most likely miss the target and cause lots of collateral damage.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.740]   So having it working its way through the court, I think is fine.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:24.340]   The Ninth Circuit really did like Epic's points and not Apple's.
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:29.260]   The judge wrote Apple's argument, "Overlooks aspects of the panel's opinions, analysis
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:33.660]   that are inconvenient to its position."
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:39.340]   Smith said, "The Epic's role as a game's distributor justified a broad-reaching injunction."
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:44.540]   Smith said, "Competition, law injunctions often have incidental benefits to non-parties.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:50.620]   That's because antitrust law protects competition, not individual market participants."
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:57.920]   So Apple seemed to make arguments that, "Challenge an imagined panel opinion on an imagined
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920]   record."
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:05.600]   They did not address the Ninth Circuit's opinion, in other words.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.960]   Judge, they don't have a great sense of humor.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.560]   The farther up you go up the ladder there.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.720]   Well, and I wonder, with the Ninth Circuit, the reason Smith writes that, of course, is
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.280]   that's going to be on the record for the Supreme Court to see.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:27.360]   I think Smith is saying specifically, "This appeal is not based on what we said, SCOTUS,
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.440]   and you should receive what we said first."
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:35.680]   I'm really interested to see how this one fights out.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:41.340]   I think that Apple can make arguments, as we all have, about how we shouldn't allow people
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.320]   to side load apps, because there are threats to security from there.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:49.120]   It's harder when they say, "Okay, well, if you're basically saying we either take 30%
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:55.480]   of your book sales, your comic book sales, your game sales, or you force people to download
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.960]   and buy it from a website."
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.000]   It's hard for them to argue that, "Oh my God, the security problems of including a link
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.040]   within the app so you go directly to the store."
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040]   It's for the customers.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.040]   We're worried about the customers.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.200]   That's why we're doing it.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.840]   I'm really keen to see how Apple defends that part of it.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:17.040]   I think that the defense will be mostly, it's going to wrap around antitrust and wear
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.040]   antitrust.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.560]   What a monopoly means.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:25.360]   That's where a lot of this comes up into it, which is that Apple is selling about 17%
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:31.400]   of the global market right now, and less than 50%, or very close to 50%.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.120]   It's really whether you define the Apple ecosystem as a monopoly, or whether you define it as
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.040]   part of the smartphone ecosystem.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.360]   It's really not about, I think that what Apple is going to argue is it's not really about
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.240]   whether they should or should not do that.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:51.040]   If they are not defined as a monopoly, they cannot be forced to open up their store.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.080]   The whole argument is going to, that's what they're going to argue is that they're not
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.880]   going to be able to open up a monopoly because they don't have a controlling interest to
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   the market.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.280]   I think that that's what Apple is going to push on.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.840]   We'll see.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.680]   It'll tell us a lot.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.680]   The current Supreme Court will tell us a lot about the Supreme Court.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.080]   If it gets up there and they make a decision, whichever direction they go, it can give everybody
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.160]   a sense of where the Supreme Court stands on that process.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.800]   How much risk can you take with this court in place?
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.160]   I think it will swing the needle one way or another.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.320]   I think that Tim Sweeney of Epic tweeted his displeasure.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.280]   That's the place to tweet it.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.520]   Sadly, Apple's anti-steering rules, that's the anti-steering rules of the things that
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:40.920]   prevented from putting a link into the, say, the Epic store to buy stuff for Fortnite,
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.240]   which both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court found to be illegal will remain
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.720]   in place as the Ninth Circuit Court stayed the injunction that puts an end to the practice.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:56.080]   It's just delayed again, says Tim Sweeney.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.000]   It'll be interesting to see if Epic wins.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.800]   I mean, not by wins, but overall wins.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.920]   This is the only point, right, that Epic won on.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.920]   They lost on every other point.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.880]   What I mean by this is that in the overall path, this will either be something that was
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:16.440]   genius by Epic because they make billions because they finally break down the Great
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.480]   Apple.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:21.600]   They make billions of dollars because they don't have to pay 30% or it's going to be
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:29.000]   seen as a Greek level Epic failure, which, you know, Greek, Greek, a tragedy, Epic failure,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.360]   because Epic failure because the order to put it in terms Lionel Messi would understand
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.160]   a self goal.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.320]   It's not the word zone goal.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   Own goal.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   Sorry.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   Okay.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320]   I'm not a soccer fan.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:49.320]   I'm just a demonstrate.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.600]   You are an upper-head broadcaster.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.080]   Noomerous tweets complained.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.080]   Okay.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.080]   Go ahead.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.080]   You've been chiving for your actions.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080]   I've been chiving.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:01.440]   They had a really cushy relationship with Apple that they burned up and it'll be interesting
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.200]   to see, you know, now that Apple is partnered with Unity, Apple's building a lot of other
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   bits and pieces.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.720]   Now, if the headset doesn't go anywhere, then it probably doesn't matter.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:13.320]   But if the headset turns out to be the next platform that really is big on Apple's side,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:20.160]   I don't think that Apple is giving Unreal or Epic any special treatment, you know, and
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.080]   probably the least it's kind of minimum effort, you know, connection to Epic.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.840]   And so that's that may, you know, again, if they, if they, they may have cut their, because
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.480]   the crazy thing is the vision platform is exactly what Unreal is built for.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:43.000]   And so to be kind of essentially shunted out of it is, you know, may turn out to be a
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.480]   really expensive mistake.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   Yep.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   The actors are out now along with the writers.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.840]   And that means in about what, six to eight months, TV's going to suck.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.240]   You know, here's the problem.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.480]   Here's the problem with that is is that there's so much in the back catalog for the streamers.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:09.240]   The real challenge with this whole strike is that TV will, well, TV will stink, but in
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.480]   Netflix and we're now prime and all that stuff.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   And prime and Apple.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.440]   We have so many, I'm, you know, we're watching so much back.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.840]   Finally, a chance to catch up on all those shows you missed.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.800]   You people, I just don't think that people will feel it or change their subscription behavior
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.320]   for years before they go.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   That's interesting.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320]   There's nothing there.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.000]   Because this wasn't the case the last time the writers struck.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   So right.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.520]   That is a big difference, isn't it?
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.800]   And the problem is that the primary people that they're striking against are the ones
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.760]   that can last the longest.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:45.360]   And the market that still pays them is the one that can last the least longest.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.800]   So, so the, so what they may end up doing is basically shunting the business into it.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.360]   Because what we may just, a lot of people may just stop watching TV and watch streaming
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.800]   because there's nothing new.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.400]   All there is is reality shows on TV.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:03.080]   And what there is is still all these things that we haven't seen on all these networks.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.920]   And so that's the thing that I think is going to be really, you know, I think it's a complicated
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.480]   part of the strike.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.320]   You know, I think that, I think that what they're striking about is a very valid and
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.320]   very important subject for them to cover because their business is changing dramatically.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.160]   And I think that they have to reset that.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.480]   So I'm not arguing with why they're striking.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.920]   I'm simply saying that it's going to be totally hard.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.160]   It could last, this could last through into next, well into next year.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:35.960]   It means we will not know what happened in severance for years to come.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   Potentially, potentially.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.440]   But you know, it was a big race.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.600]   My brother was working on a film for a streamer and they got down to, they had to submit
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.040]   it before the strike for like, they had like two hours left.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.040]   Oh my God.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.440]   You know, to get it in.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.120]   And so they were, you know, it was a close call.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:58.920]   Oppenheimer and Barbie open today, but the stars of Oppenheimer walked out of the premiere
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.960]   in London a couple of days ago.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   Right.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.480]   Since the strike was called midnight Eastern or whenever they went on strike.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.720]   They just walked out.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.560]   One quick glass of champagne and I'm out of here.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.040]   Yeah, it's a tough one because like Alex said, I mean, the truth is you are trying to
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.000]   have two parties do a negotiation for the future of this business when they don't know
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.400]   what the future of the business is.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.400]   True.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   That's the bottom line.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:27.000]   I'm tired when I see these arguments that say, oh, they can't, the unions can't hold the
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.120]   streamers to task right now because the streamers are trying to figure out their business model.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.680]   And it's like, that's true, but also they can't just mail it in because as the business
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:43.000]   model has already changed, the things that the union members relied on for their livelihood
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.880]   has already been swept out from under them.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.040]   So they could come together and come up with a reasonable agreement here.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:28:00.440]   I do kind of wonder if the end game of this is going to be a short agreement so that because
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.000]   really nobody knows how this is going to go.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.120]   And in the end, yeah, I think in the end, the net amount of money in this business is
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.120]   going to be less.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.960]   It's just going to be less.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.240]   And that makes everybody want to claw as much of it out as they possibly can.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.600]   And I totally get that.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.400]   But the challenge is like, we don't even know what the gotches are right now because we
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:25.000]   don't know what the final landing place of all of these changes in the streaming industry
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   are going to be.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.320]   So I do sometimes wonder if they're going to do this happens in sports, which I'm more
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:34.200]   familiar with, sports negotiation is sometimes what you say is, look, okay, we can't agree
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.760]   on a five year or a 10 year or a seven year deal here.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.800]   Let's do three years and come back here then.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.880]   We'll keep working under slight changes and then that's going to expire and we'll both
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.800]   be able to fight over what we want to do.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.080]   But it's tough because then you're guaranteeing almost another strike in three years.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:57.800]   And the hard part is that for the actors and the writers as technology moves forward, the
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.680]   producers have less have less reason to negotiate with them every year.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.080]   So I think that's why they had to do it when they're doing it now.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.640]   It's because as AI picks up speed, as the global production picks up speed, as all these
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   other things that these companies are working on picks up speed, they don't they just may
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:17.200]   be able to last a lot longer.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.520]   And so I think that it's really, it's a really problematic thing.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   Again, I'm not arguing with the way why they're doing it.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:31.800]   I'm just saying that it's a really hard battle for the SAG, AFTRA and WGA that it'll be a
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800]   hard one to win.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.480]   A truth of labor negotiation is once you get something, you never give it up.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.560]   And that's the challenge in trying to say, can we do something in the interim and figure
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:49.440]   this out later is the SAG and WGA are going to say, we are dying here.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.680]   We need to make changes now.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.800]   We can't push this off for three years.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.960]   But the other side is like, yeah, but if I give you something now, you got it forever.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.440]   And so that's why we're at this.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:04.640]   It's scary because this could be, it's exactly the wrong time for this to happen.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.560]   Two years ago would have been great for the writers and the actors.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:11.200]   Two years from now, at least the ground might be a little more settled.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.280]   But right now it's the worst possible time for this to happen.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:19.600]   I think for everybody, because nobody, there's nothing like negotiating with a company that
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.280]   is not sure even what it will be in a year.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.040]   Disney is a good example of that.
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.680]   Are they going to sell off their linear?
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.640]   Are they going to get a strategic partner for ESPN?
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.360]   There's some rumors out there that ESPN might end up being a joint venture with Apple or
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.480]   Amazon or Google.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.600]   That might actually, Iger is open to that now, but nobody knows.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.200]   And so it's changed so much in the last two years.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.880]   Would you, if you were an entertainment company, make a deal contingent on what you think it
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.600]   might be in two years?
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.880]   You personally, executive may not even have a job in two years.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.880]   So who knows?
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.160]   There's an interesting side to note to this.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:03.040]   I noticed this morning that there are some independent filmmakers that are going ahead
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.680]   because they're not members of AMPTP.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.680]   They're not in the process.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.680]   They have side agreements.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.520]   Mark Ruffalo tweeted, "How about we all jump into indies now?
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.720]   Content creators create a film and TV making system alongside the studio on streaming network.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.360]   So there's actual competition."
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.960]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:28.280]   There will be production, but it'll be from independent producers.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   Maybe this is an opportunity.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.200]   And they could potentially sell those...
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.200]   Two streamers.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:38.280]   Two streamers or whatever, because they would be building it on the outside.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.840]   And yeah, I mean, it could happen.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.600]   But the problem is that the streamers still wouldn't be giving their data or money.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.600]   It's true.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.760]   They could keep on working.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:52.160]   So there's that outside of that, but they're not going to get...
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.320]   And the hard part really is that we're getting, I think, the viewer, even my...
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.280]   I watched my kids' behavior.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:04.240]   And their behavior is that on things that are commercially entities, they really expect
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.600]   a certain level of quality that's really hard to get as an indie.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.640]   We're now watching lots of movies that have $100 million, $200 million, $300 million budgets.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.520]   And it's really hard for an indie to do something that feels like it's worth watching.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:21.800]   What's really interesting is that kids will go the opposite direction and they want something
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.640]   with no production value on TikTok or on Snap.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:29.680]   So they want no production value there, but when they start watching TV shows a lot of
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.920]   times they expect something different.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.280]   Let's hope that TV has left.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.360]   It's production value.
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:41.160]   Let's hope that it's not just kids that decide what content gets produced because that's not
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.160]   a good solution.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.480]   Well, I mean, oftentimes as they get older though, you pay a lot of attention to what
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.520]   kids are doing because they move a lot of markets.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:54.600]   And that's why we have so many comic book movies in the theaters today.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:58.240]   Although those are, I mean, I think a lot of times people are really looking at those.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.440]   That market is getting pretty soft.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.440]   Good.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440]   It's finally.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.440]   So they're, you know, they're that.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:09.400]   You guys can go back to reading your poorly printed four color pulp fiction magazines and
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.360]   leave the movies to us grownups.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.200]   I mean, the hard part is is that they don't really know why people like people aren't really
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.440]   going to anything other than tent pole movies in the theater.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.040]   So but it's what tent pole movies like a lot of people are probably going to go to Oppenheimer
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.040]   or Mission Impossible missed.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.520]   It's made a lot of money.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   But it didn't do it.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.520]   Oh, interesting.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:33.440]   How about dial of destiny, which is got to be the worst type of movie I've ever heard.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.680]   It also came in soft.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.400]   So so it's Barbie.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.000]   It's Barbie and Oppenheimer open today.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.160]   I've already purchased IMX 70 millimeter tickets for Oppenheimer.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.520]   The best seats.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.520]   The Barbie.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.920]   The best seats are already gone.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.800]   Like for weeks, right?
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.440]   If the IMX theater that center core where you want to sit.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.880]   There's 12 seats.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.400]   There's only there's only a few really good seats.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.960]   If you're going to pay if you're going to pay for parking and pop a corn and everything
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.200]   else, there's 12 seats.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.640]   Well, you know, I got $2 off because I'm a senior.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.640]   So there's that.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.640]   There you go.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:08.640]   Very good.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.040]   I don't like to shit too close.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.800]   Anyway, we are about where you want to be center, right?
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.240]   Because the sound is is but you also.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.760]   But you also theater you going to the the metric on the 70 millimeter.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.960]   So we're about five rows from the top, which is not ideal, but it's center.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:25.960]   Yep.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   That's better than nothing.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:31.800]   I mean, that whole center, the heart of the theater is all bought out for like the whole
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.360]   run.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.840]   You know, people like the good jumped on it.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:39.520]   The good news is that you you it is a hundred hundred day run.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.520]   So you can wait for a little.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.840]   Oh, I wasn't the whole run.
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.840]   Okay.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   I looked only through August.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.840]   So, okay.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.360]   But it might be that might be the whole run in IMX.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.080]   So that might be that might be the case.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.080]   I'm not running regular theaters, but the IMX.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:54.760]   But you can go to, but you can go to Emeryville, which is like the worst parking experience.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.240]   But I wanted 70.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.600]   Christopher Nolan said, I should see it in 70 millimeter.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.800]   Oh, there you go.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.000]   And I'm going to do what Nolan says.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.560]   I hope I'm sure my, I'm sure my phone screen is wider than 70 millimeter.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.120]   You know, honestly, and I suspect this is what the calculus is.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.880]   I thought mission impossible.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.320]   Yeah, I'd like to see that in the theater.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.320]   I'm not a pilot destiny.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.440]   I could see that at home.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.320]   I'm sure people do make that calculus.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.320]   Like I saw your, your, your tweets, Alex, you were disappointed.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.080]   You went to the theater.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.360]   I, you know, I wasn't disappointed.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.400]   I was just, it was one of those things that I wasn't, I have to admit the, when I didn't
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:42.000]   put in the tweet was the, the parking, the parking process at the Emeryville, AMC is so
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   frustrating that I'll never go back.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.480]   So, so I can just, like they have an app that doesn't work.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.560]   And you're sitting there, like, I don't care how much it costs.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.320]   I just don't want to have to spend the next half an hour trying to figure out how to get
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.080]   out of the, out of the parking lot.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.360]   So the, so, so, but so that was, that took a, that took a chunk out of my, my interest
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.200]   in being there.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.880]   But, but at the same time, the, you know, I felt like it was really good.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.320]   It was fun to watch on a big screen.
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.800]   I did feel like I spent a lot of money on it and I just watched six, all six of the
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.740]   non-conceables, on the phone.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:20.280]   You know, one at, one at a, one at a day, not like all at one time.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.880]   Were you sick of Tom Cruise by day five, but said, well, I've started, I got to keep
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.880]   going.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.680]   No, I was left with, he's pretty good at what he does.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.220]   You know, like, he's a good, there's nobody better running in the world.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:32.700]   He's really, he's got such great running form.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:35.420]   You know, like it's, it's got this very intentional.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.420]   Very intentional.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.420]   You know, he's going to get there.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.560]   He's in a hurry and he's not going to flag or fail.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.720]   He's really good at it.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.320]   And he's not like, he's not like Steven Seagal, which you're like, wow.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.920]   I think there's been wrong there.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:53.040]   So, so like, like, you never, you ever watch, you watch Tom Cruise running and why Steven
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:56.600]   Seagal run and it just, it's a completely different experience.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.840]   See Steven Seagal run?
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.840]   No, no, no, no.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.640]   His, his action stuff is there, there will be, there will be like two scenes of the movie
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.160]   where he gets up from the chair.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.320]   He's in and gets into another chair in the same room.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.560]   That's where he is right now.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.480]   No, no, but I'm saying that even, you go back to the original, you know, above the law
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.880]   or whatever and, and, and,
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.520]   Oh, he runs weird, doesn't he?
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.000]   Look at, look at, look at him.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.360]   That's not good running.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.200]   That's bad form.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:25.760]   I think probably Tom Cruise looked at this and said, I'm not going to run like Steven
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.440]   Seagal because his arms are going to Kimbo Tom.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.560]   He does the karate chop and then he.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.040]   But Seagal, no.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.040]   Arms of Kimbo.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.040]   That's bad.
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.040]   So it was good.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.080]   I found that I was like, it was, it wasn't like I was disappointed with the film experience
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.080]   was better.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.080]   Fairly.
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.960]   This is a super kind of Steven Seagal running.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.960]   I know.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:52.960]   And now resting.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.040]   I'm not the only one that's noticed.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.600]   The running might be a little.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   Here's Tom running.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.600]   See, he's got his arms, it's the arms, the thumbs, the thumbs.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.080]   He's working hard.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.080]   I'm getting there.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.080]   And he has faces going.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.760]   He's got a big difference there.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.960]   There's an intentionality there that.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.800]   Look at him run down the side of a building.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.040]   He even running down the.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.720]   He knows how cool Chris Rokori will make anything he does look and he's not going to waste
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720]   that.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.280]   He's not going to say, oh, I have to, I can ease off because I'm going to look good no
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.280]   matter what is.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.040]   But if I still give my all, it's going to look like I'm freaking Superman.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.040]   One of the good movies.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:31.040]   I don't, I don't.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.040]   Okay.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.040]   I'm not a Tom Cruise fan.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.120]   What I will say is that I think that I think that the seven was really good.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:40.000]   It's better than being at home, but I think that what I was left with is all in all, like
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.080]   all the things added up of driving, parking, pain, doing all those things.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.840]   It wasn't that the theater experience wasn't as, was not as good as my home experience.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.840]   It was better than my home experience.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.560]   It's a great experience.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.160]   It's just that I'm not sure that the, it was worth, it was worth the trouble to get there.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.400]   I'm totally with you.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:02.120]   So Indiana Jones was the first movie I've seen in a theater since 2019.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:06.200]   And it was, if I enjoyed it, I thought it was a really good movie, but I could imagine
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:11.480]   that if all I had to do, because I saw it like in the city, so, but also all I had to
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:15.720]   do was like pay like maybe four dollars in public transit fair to get there.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.920]   I didn't have to park, didn't have to find a parking space.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:23.720]   I years and years ago, I had already broken the habit of buying snacks inside the theater.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.360]   So it really just cost me whatever you say.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:31.200]   You're the guy who wears the big overcoat that's loaded with his eigen mics and popcorn.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.800]   You know, I got the JUJU bees here.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.720]   I got the eks and mics here.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   I'm going to give you a tip.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.520]   They never, they will, they never check for your hump.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.280]   Like if you're wearing a hump, they're going to, they're, they don't, then I could have
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.280]   won a product to find out if it's actually like squishy or something like that.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.280]   Excuse me.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]   His child destiny.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   It's in theater.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.280]   One man.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.280]   One manly.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.280]   He's filming over just like any of you.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.480]   Oh, and the Andy Andy.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.080]   Actually, just put it in your fedora.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.680]   You got a roomy fedora.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.680]   They're not going to take your hand.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.240]   And I know these summer months, it's pretty stinky.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.040]   They're not going to look under there.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.040]   That's a good tip.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.040]   I'll try that.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.040]   My first movie since 2019 will be Oppenheimer actually, the first theater experience.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.760]   But that's, see, IMAX is, there's, you can't duplicate that in your home.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.840]   I have a very nice, so I'm going to set up.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:22.400]   And I'm going to go see Oppenheimer and, and IMAX.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   I have to see it.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:26.400]   You want to join us.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:30.440]   I just have to, you could sit four rows from the back.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.320]   What are you going?
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.320]   August 12th.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320]   Okay.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:39.240]   That was the, the first time we could get a good seater August 11th.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.240]   I don't, yeah.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.600]   It was a Friday at four, fifteen.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.560]   I looked at so many seating charts.
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.520]   Trying to find the possible, the mission impossible is odd, ten, thirty in the morning.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:52.520]   Yeah, you have to because otherwise you get to find a good seats.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.520]   Terrible seats.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.760]   All I want to be seated away from other people.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:02.680]   That's, I'm still not, I'm still not here for like random crowds and movie theaters who
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.680]   are not masked.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.160]   I'm not, I'm not here for that.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.280]   Prepare yourself, my friends.

[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:35.840]   plant it and then cook after work where you go home and you got your Hello, fresh there.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.680]   You are ready to eat in 15 minutes.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.760]   I know these days were all tempted by that takeout menu, right?
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:48.120]   Hello, fresh is 25% cheaper than takeout and it tastes a lot better.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.120]   Plus you made it.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.760]   Makes you feel good.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:54.360]   I think you're going to love Hello, fresh 40 different recipes to choose from every week.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.560]   You'll never get bored.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.760]   You'll always find something new to try and love.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:01.480]   And then once you've made it, you also know how, which is another good side effect of
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.680]   Hello, fresh.
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.480]   Hello, fresh America's number one meal kit.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:13.400]   Go to hellofresh.com/macbreak50 and you'll get 50% off plus free shipping.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:20.360]   Use that code Macbreak50 at hellofresh.com/macbreak50.
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:27.160]   You need the code still though, Macbreak 50 for 50% off plus free shipping.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.160]   I'm ready.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.560]   I should have brought some to work.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.720]   Hello, fresh.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.520]   I got an email, time for the pics of the week.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:45.200]   I got an email from Sebastian DeWitt, who you all know is the guy behind Halide.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.400]   He says, "It's been a while since we updated Spectre, but this is a pretty significant update.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.120]   Two big changes.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.160]   Spectre, which I love by the way, and I do use, it's for long exposures.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:59.280]   So it's one of the things the iPhone can't do without a little bit of help.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:01.800]   It does stabilizing the shots.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.640]   It does it over several seconds so you can hand hold it.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:10.400]   You can get long exposures up to nine seconds without a tripod, which is really fantastic.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.200]   I just love the effects of Spectre.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.920]   So they made the core Spectre is free now.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:21.320]   I've been paying for it for some time, but it's free now.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:25.000]   For the free version, you can go up to three seconds, which probably for most of the time
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.760]   is sufficient.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:34.000]   They're also introducing a one-time purchase, 499 Spectre Pro, and that gets up to 30 second
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.040]   exposures, which is I haven't had a chance to use Spectre.cam/download, but I'm going
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:46.160]   to guess you guys also have used Spectre.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160]   It is a really nice app.
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:53.160]   Of course, Halide is a must-have app as well, but this adds a feature that the iPhone doesn't
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.080]   really have.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:03.960]   So it's really nice to have Spectre now free with a 499 Spectre Pro.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.760]   That's my pick of the week, Alex Lindsey.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.760]   What's yours?
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.320]   Oh, there we go.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:13.520]   I've been doing some production with my phone.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.520]   The phone is really good.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.520]   The video is really good.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.520]   The audio is not good.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.160]   So you're trying to figure out how do I get good audio into the phone?
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.880]   So one of the things that I've been using is this Saramonic.
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:26.200]   It's called a Smart Rig Plus DI.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.840]   They have a bunch of different versions of this, so this is the one that's going to put
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840]   in there.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:31.840]   There you go.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:32.840]   That's what it looks like.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.200]   And it has two XLR inputs on it as well as a lightning connector.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.640]   It looks like a little zoom.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.960]   It's a little like that.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.200]   It doesn't record, but it does have a nine-volt battery, so you can power your mic.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.520]   So if you've got a powered mic that you want to...
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:46.520]   It's something that you need.
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:47.520]   It's Santa-worthy.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.520]   Okay.
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:54.160]   So you can also set it to either be sending audio in or sending audio out.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   It's got some.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.920]   And it also has some eighth-inch jacks.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:59.320]   So if you like the little mics that are there.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:03.440]   So in addition to the XLR, you'll see that there's little eighth-inch jacks up there
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.240]   as well.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.240]   And so anyway, it's pretty simple.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:12.080]   It's got a quarter 20 on the bottom there, so that what's useful about that, of course,
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.080]   you can rig it up.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:17.760]   So if you get a rig, I've talked about small rig things for my phone before, you can attach
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.960]   this right to your rig.
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.600]   And we've been using these on and off for years.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.480]   And so this one's been the most stable of the bunch that we've used.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.720]   And so what it does is it lets you take professional...
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.800]   Now we'll do everything from a professional handheld mic all the way up to like, electrosonic
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.040]   transmitters and receivers.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:39.720]   So we can take electro...
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.520]   It seems like a lot, but if you're doing something to Instagram or you're doing something
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.920]   to some of the other platforms, they only let you use your phone.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.360]   And so you can use your phone, but still get great audio.
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.000]   And we've piped literally mixers' worth of audio back into this to get that audio back
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000]   in.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.600]   But you can attach it to a rig and it works really well.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:04.720]   And for only $179, you can add a headphone jack to your iPhone.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:05.720]   There you go.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:06.720]   There you go.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.720]   That's another...
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:08.720]   Another thing you can do.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:16.120]   So the only thing I worry about is that it looks like the cable is hardwired into the
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.120]   device.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.720]   And if Apple abandons lightning, then this is going to have a short shelf life.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:24.080]   For this one's lightning, there is a USB-C version of this as well.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.440]   So you could wait until if you decide you want to, you could wait with this until the
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.880]   fall and find out if you've got a year worth of it.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.800]   But it's great for getting, again, if you're looking for getting professional audio into
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.760]   your iPhone, it's a really useful device.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.280]   This is the Ceramonic Smite Rig.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.600]   $179.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   They do offer...
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.600]   Yeah, yeah, I see.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.600]   They have lightning.
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.840]   Two channel, they also have lightning.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.440]   One channel if you wanted to really just do a microphone or something.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.840]   I'd recommend the two.
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.840]   Might as well.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:57.840]   Splurge.
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.840]   Enjoy.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:05.240]   And they also have a Type C. So you could use it with your iPad or something like that.
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.320]   Mr. Andy Enoco.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.840]   What's your pick this week?
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.840]   You are muted, my friend.
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:14.840]   You...
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.840]   Sorry.
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.480]   Yeah, mine is a mystery.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:21.440]   I'm recommending something that I've installed but have not been outside yet to try.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.880]   It is an XR/Ogmented Reality game by Google and Taito.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.880]   Taito-T-A-I-T-O.
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:29.880]   Makes the Space Invaders.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:32.120]   It is an augmented reality version of Space Invaders.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.120]   What?
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.320]   Oh, I gotta have this.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:38.800]   You go outside and the Space Invaders are in the sky.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.360]   And if you're in a city, they slide in and out between buildings and they know what the
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.560]   lines of the streets are.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.240]   So basically follows the lines of the street.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.240]   Does your phone go...
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.240]   It has...
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.240]   It's licensed.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.240]   So it has all the music and everything.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.240]   Oh!
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.000]   Oh, I want this so bad.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.640]   Look at that.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.760]   That's just the trailer.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.360]   But I've only run it long enough to know, realize that you can't use it inside.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.400]   You have to be outside to make it work.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   But it's free.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.560]   There are no in-app purchases.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:12.280]   There is data tracking but you can opt out of it.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.760]   If you go into settings like this number three on the list and you opt out of data tracking.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.000]   So who knows?
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.720]   But it's a nice free thing to play with.
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:26.760]   This is the sort of augmented reality that in 2023, 2024, I'm most keen about because
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:31.000]   you know, yes, you'll look like a dork standing in the middle of the car.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000]   Who cares?
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000]   You're playing Space Invaders in the dark.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000]   But at least you'll be able to see...
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000]   You're not wearing goggles.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.760]   You'll see people around you pointing and laughing and shooting like abusive TikTok videos
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.840]   about how stupid you look.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.160]   So that's a very, very good positive thing.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.320]   I'm also not exactly sure.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:52.920]   Again, I live in a 350 year old quaint New England seaside boat colony.
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:57.720]   I'm not sure if there are enough tall buildings to really sell the effect of these Space Invaders.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:00.520]   I intend to find out in about a half an hour.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:04.800]   But hey, if you live in Chicago New York, San Francisco, I think that will be kind of fun.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:05.800]   Kind of cool.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.720]   And you can forget from just the App Store, the Google Play Store, wherever.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.720]   Just drop today.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:16.120]   There aren't even people who do game channels on YouTube who are like, "Oh my God, I've
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.120]   got to have the first review out there."
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:19.720]   They're not even like first reviews out there.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:22.120]   So that's how early this is.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.520]   This is so cool.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.600]   iOS or Android, Space Invaders World Defense.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.840]   There's also an iPad version, which would be kind of fun to...
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.600]   If you really want to look like a dork.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.000]   This to me, this is what they are.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   This is a better use AR than slapping something on my forehead.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000]   I like this.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]   It looks like fun.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000]   For now.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.800]   Space, you have awareness of the world around you while still having augmented reality.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.200]   It's a nice demo.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.800]   Lastly, it's a nice demo.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:55.720]   They tease this at Google I/O in May because they have a new AR kit sort of thing that
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:52:00.840]   is like if you want to build third party apps that integrate AR in the real world environment,
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.600]   not only taking advantage of the camera, but also taking advantage of Google Maps Street
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.480]   View 3D data.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.400]   There is a way that you can implement into that.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:14.600]   So this is clearly a way to celebrate the 45th anniversary of Space Invaders, but also
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.560]   to point out that, yeah, we don't have a headset.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.760]   We have no plans to make one.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.320]   We probably would screw it up if we did make one, but it's not as though we're having
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.000]   been thinking about a minute rarely ourselves.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.440]   Hey, look, free game.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.440]   This is so cool.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.120]   I can't wait to play it.
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.440]   I've installed it.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.440]   I'm ready.
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:37.040]   I'm ready to save the world from a pixelated 8-bit monsters.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.800]   And yeah, it says play outside.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.800]   All right.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.800]   Yes.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:41.800]   Thank you, Andy and Akko.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.640]   Jason Snell, pick of the week.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:48.760]   Yeah, I'm going to pick something that shockingly hasn't been picked since 2010, which is amazing.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:53.600]   We actually put this app in the Hall of Fame of our awards for iOS apps at Mac world back
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.600]   in the day.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:59.280]   It's the MLB app, which sounds really generic, but I've got various reasons to recommend
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.280]   it again.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:05.360]   First off, it is if you subscribe to MLB TV, you can watch all the games except your local
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.360]   market.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.120]   I'll put note there that I'll get to in a second, but I'm a subscriber.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.560]   I'm very happy I watch it on Apple TV, but you know what?
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:15.960]   Sometimes I want to watch it on my Mac and it is the rarest of apps.
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.840]   It's an iPad app that actually works on the Mac.
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:25.600]   So you actually have the ability to watch the video on your Mac.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:31.440]   And I do that a lot, but there's also a pretty so also a bunch of things are going bankrupt
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.440]   that broadcast broadcast MLB games.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.440]   I know.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.640]   So the Arizona Diamondbacks are the latest.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:43.000]   So if you're in San Diego or in Arizona and in those territories and you want and your
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.600]   cord cutter, you will now be able to just pay Major League Baseball.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.520]   I think it's like $50 for the rest of the year and use the MLB app and watch all your
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.120]   home games in your local market because they're no longer.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.320]   They will be on cable, but they're no longer exclusive to cable.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.280]   You can now actually watch them as a cord cutter, which is pretty awesome.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:04.800]   But the timely reason I wanted to mention the MLB app is that they launched a new feature
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.720]   that is now available.
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.920]   It is 3D game day.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:15.520]   And what it does is it uses all those sensors that have the precise tracking of the pitch
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:17.640]   and of the players on the field.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:23.360]   And rather than just showing you like a little 2D representation of it, they've animated
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.440]   it on the fly.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:32.480]   It looks like a video game, except it's actually what's happening in the game.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:37.920]   Mike Petrelo from MLB did a tweet about it that I think I'm putting our show notes.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:41.320]   The idea here that you can basically you're watching a game that looks like a video game,
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.240]   but it's based on all the in-game data and it's happening live.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.160]   It's pretty cool.
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:51.000]   The only my only caveat about it is that when the inning ends, rather than showing them
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:58.080]   all walk off the field, all the players sort of stand around like zombies and then descended
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.080]   to the ground.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.080]   That part of my own, I don't like that so much.
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.080]   I'm a favorite.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.800]   It's like field of dreams, but way creepier.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:10.360]   But other than that, it's actually a pretty cool idea.
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:15.520]   And you can see, speaking of AR and VR, the possibilities there as well, what if you could
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.600]   actually like put yourself out in the field of play while or put yourself at first base
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.880]   when somebody throws a grounder from shortstop at 100 miles an hour to you.
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:26.880]   It's pretty bananas.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:27.880]   Unfortunately.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:28.880]   I love that they're exploring with this.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:34.240]   The Giants are in a rain delay right now, so I can't show you what it's what it looks
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.240]   like.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.600]   They've just got a batter just standing there.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.200]   He's just waiting for the rain to go away, I guess.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.200]   But that's cool.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:44.480]   Yeah, first time I used it, I was just amazed like this is because they got all the data,
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.960]   but to somebody was like, we could build a 3D model, we can have generic play, but literally
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:51.400]   you see the pitcher wind up and they throw the ball and you see the batter swing.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.480]   And if it's a ground roll, you'll see the ball go.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:58.280]   So other than that point where they were absorbed back into mother earth, that is terrifying.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:04.440]   What if like the longer the losing streak, the game is on the more zombified and decrepit
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.680]   they look like you look at the pirate with the talent with the better way you're doing
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.320]   the forms, draping off your bones.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.320]   That would be really funny.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:15.680]   So this is where it would be happening in the live box, right?
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.680]   Yeah, there's there's the regular 2D game day and then you get the option to do the 3D
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:24.680]   game day and the 3D game day is the one that is like this bizarre, augmented.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.480]   There it is.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:46.560]   Yeah, we've got on the video, there's a micro-t
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.160]   and it turns out they haven't sold the rights to that.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:54.280]   So you can like if you're a MLB audio subscriber, you can like listen to the radio while you're
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.640]   watching the game version of the game.
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:02.360]   We come a long way from Ronald Reagan hitting a cup with a pencil and going, it's a long
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.360]   drive to center field.
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:12.960]   I think I got MLB from T-Mobile like at the beginning of the season.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.280]   I forgot that I had it.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.280]   So good.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.000]   I'll be I'll be trying that 3D.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000]   It's a great app.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.520]   It's always been one of the best apps on iOS and they they've really put a lot of effort
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.000]   into it and it's a really well-built app and yeah, it's such it's so state of the art.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.960]   Like it's just it's just this incredible really and the boy you don't hear Alex say that very
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:35.400]   often about no it's and the infrastructure that they use to stream to all those games man.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:36.400]   It is amazing.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:41.040]   Have you been you've been to that I went to the BAM which then Disney bought because they're
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.440]   like we need to stream things in the future and they literally just bought majorly baseball
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:50.520]   streaming engine for Disney plus and Hulu and it's it's a yeah, it's amazing.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.760]   Yeah, it's it's it's an amazing infrastructure and and it just it is.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.760]   Is it Seattle?
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:56.760]   It's I think it's it's where is it?
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:57.760]   New York City.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:58.760]   New York City.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:57:59.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.760]   Yeah, yeah, but Chelsea market.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:01.760]   Oh, cool.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:05.760]   When you think about it delivers it better than any other app as far as like delivering
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.520]   video to to an app.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:09.280]   It's really the top.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.280]   It's good.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.040]   One of these leagues has resolved this unlike Apple which really you wonder what their relationship
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.440]   with MLS is going to be.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:22.240]   I know going forward 20 seconds of muddy audio.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.360]   Alex Lindsay is at office hours.global.
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.520]   If you go there you can see what they're up to these days.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.680]   You can even join in.
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:31.680]   It's free.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.680]   It's amazing.
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:35.000]   You did Photoshop generative imagery today.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000]   That looked pretty cool.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.320]   Yeah, we were talking about that.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:43.000]   I got to say if you go back to last Thursday we had the the NBC Universal team that works
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.800]   on the Thursday night football that goes to.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:47.280]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:54.800]   Talking about HDR and there's probably 50 people that know what they were looking at.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.280]   Never seen what they were talking about.
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:00.760]   I mean, I don't think they may have talked about it, but it was it was really it was super
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:01.760]   deep.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:08.400]   So anyway, it was pretty pretty amazing and we've you know, everything from business to
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:12.200]   animation to you know, we had a lot of great stuff there, but that one you want to check
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.680]   out the objective color metrics.
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:18.920]   I mean, these are the the folks that are figuring this out for for football.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   Very cool.
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.400]   And really talking about what they're going through and they're developing new software
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:25.200]   and new pipelines and new, you know, bits and pieces.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.520]   It was a pretty incredible hour.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:28.520]   Office hours.global.
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:37.200]   And if you want to hire the smartest guy in streaming today for your next event 090.media.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.080]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:42.120]   Andy Enaka, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:49.160]   On next Thursday at 1245 Eastern time, go to wgphnews.org to assume it live or later.
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.720]   Thank you so much.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:57.480]   And someday there will be a website at a not go.com website.
[01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:59.440]   I only mentioned this upon my work.
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.440]   See my.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:07.400]   You can you can now, Andy, you can now just get chat chat, just tell it what you want.
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.640]   And it'll just make your website.
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:11.840]   I just I you made me think about this.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.960]   Yeah, there is no Ozamandias.com.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:14.960]   It's not too late.
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:17.600]   Maybe you could sign up right now.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:21.240]   Jason Snow is at six colors.com.
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:28.160]   If you go to six colors.com/json, you'll see all the multitudinous things he does.
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.520]   I love this idea.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.280]   You were talking before the show and it club trip members will see it on our trip plus
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:39.240]   feed about 360 video of a table.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.520]   Would that be for your like tabletop gaming or?
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:46.760]   We played a D&D session with an Insta360 X3 on the table in the center and theoretically
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:53.520]   you'll be able to see when I do this video all the all of the players and also like the
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:58.800]   map that's on the table with one without doing because I didn't you know, I didn't have a
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.800]   film crew there.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:00.800]   It was literally just me.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.040]   So I set an Insta360 on the table and pressed record.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.440]   And it actually looks pretty good.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.800]   So it's we do some fun experiments with stuff like that and the incomparable is a place.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:15.160]   This story in my career, Leo, which is one of the ways that I enjoy being a tech person
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:20.560]   and a media person is I find new tech and I'm like, how could I apply this to what I
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.560]   do?
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:26.840]   So I bought an Insta360 and it's kind of fun to do for in person stuff.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.840]   So yeah, I'm just experimenting.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.640]   I think that's the case with all good.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.280]   All the people we work with this, it's just we love this stuff.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.040]   So we buy it and play with it.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.600]   And then we tend to be the techier among the crowd of people and whatever media we're
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:40.600]   in.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.920]   So we're the ones who are like, say, did you know about this 360 camera and they're like,
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.280]   no, I've never heard of it.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.280]   Right.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.280]   Well, this is it.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:48.280]   Right.
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.280]   And then you go.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.400]   That's the one I brought to Rome and have some amazing video of Rome.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:54.400]   It's really incredible.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.400]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.400]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.400]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:58.400]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:01.880]   Thanks to all our club twit members who, of course, are so important to us.
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.520]   If you're not yet a member of club twit, seven bucks a month gets you ad free versions
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:08.360]   of this show and everything we do.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:12.960]   And when I say everything we do, you even get shows that are not available in the regular
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:18.920]   public feeds, things like hands on Macintosh with Micah Sergeant.
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.920]   We just launched Scott Wilkinson's home theater geeks.
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.840]   There's hands on windows with Paul Therat.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.120]   There's the untitled Linux show Stacey's book club.
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:33.160]   The Gizfiz Ray Maxwell is kind of champing up the bit to bring back Maxwell's house.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.720]   I think we might do that as well.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:39.520]   A great place to hang with other geeks doing exactly what you just talked about, Jason,
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:42.240]   you know, playing with stuff and using it.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:43.240]   It's so great.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.240]   We have a discord as well.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.640]   It's very active, always fun to be in our discord.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:54.800]   The twit plus feed also has before and after the show stuff, things like our inside twit
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.720]   that we did the drunken inside twit we did Friday night with ribs from aunt, brown liquor
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:02.840]   from aunt and champagne from Lisa.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:04.560]   And we were all arranged together.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:05.560]   It was fun.
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:06.560]   Wasn't it, John Ashley?
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.400]   We had a good time doing that.
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:11.000]   And John's letting it wasn't happy, but we did clean up.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.440]   I think we did very nice.
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:19.320]   You found no empty bottles, no, no skeletons, no rib bones, nothing after the fact.
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.680]   All of that on the twit plus feed seven bucks a month.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:22.680]   I think it's worth it.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:23.680]   And it helped.
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:26.800]   And you know what, even if we didn't have all those benefits, you would have the good
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:30.680]   feeling of knowing you're helping keeping twit alive on the air and producing new content
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:31.920]   for you all the time.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.240]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.760]   If you're not yet a member, please do us a favor.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.120]   If you can afford it, of course, only if you can afford it.
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.080]   Don't want to take money that you don't have or lunch out of your mouth.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:46.400]   But if you can afford seven bucks a month, we would sure appreciate it.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.680]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:51.680]   We do this show every Tuesday.
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:52.680]   We stream it live.
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:58.280]   If you want to watch us do it live, audio or video at twit.tv/live.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.920]   If you are watching live, chat with us live.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:02.240]   Our IRC is open to all.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:03.240]   You can use your browser.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:05.000]   You just point it to IRC.twit.tv.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.040]   Of course, club twit members also have that discord.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.600]   They can join.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:16.680]   We have after the fact shows available at the website, twit.tv/mbw for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.240]   There's also a Mac Break Weekly YouTube channel.
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:23.840]   Just wait to get this show.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:26.760]   That way you'll get it automatically the minute it's available.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.360]   Just search for twit or Mac Break Weekly and press the subscribe button.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:33.600]   It won't cost you a thing and you'll have the show.
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:34.800]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:39.880]   Now it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:40.880]   Bye bye.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.760]   Hey, we should talk Linux.
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:46.880]   It's the operating system that runs the internet, but you game consoles, cell phones,
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.680]   and maybe even the machine on your desk.
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:50.400]   But you already knew all that.
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:54.560]   What you may not know is that Twit now is a show dedicated to it, the Untitled Linux
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.560]   Show.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.920]   Whether you're a Linux pro, a burgeoning cis-ed man, or just curious what the big deal is,
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:05.440]   you should join us on the Club Twit Discord every Saturday afternoon for news, analysis,
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:07.960]   and tips to sharpen your Linux skills.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.840]   And then make sure you subscribe to the Club Twit exclusive Untitled Linux Show.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.600]   Wait, you're not a Club Twit member yet?
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:18.960]   You'll go to twit.tv/clubtwit and sign up.
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:19.600]   Hope to see you there.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:29.600]   [MUSIC]
