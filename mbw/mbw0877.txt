[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.160]   And the regulars are in the house. Let's say hello to Alex Lindsay of Office Hours.Global.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:09.600]   Hello. Perfect sound and picture. Five out of five. Rumorator loves the shot. Also Andy Inaco
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.320]   from WGBH and Boston Radio Guy, but he also looks mighty fine.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.280]   Hey, there. Thank you very much. And you're not flooded out. You're not wearing your wings.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.840]   I'm mentally always, but as far as the home. No, no problem. Please to hear it.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.760]   From Marin just down the road of peace, Jason Sal of six colors.com. Hello, Jason.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   Hello, Leo. Good to be here. You get your vision pro yet?
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.640]   Alas, I think I'm going to have to wait a while on that. I'm not sitting on the front porch hoping
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.680]   that a box is delivered. You and everybody. Yeah. I also want to, but that's great because
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.800]   just quickly that the fact that he answered the question means that he doesn't have it.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.200]   That's the community. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We're going to do this from now through next year.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.120]   If that G4 AMX screen is ever tilted off screen, that means he has the vision pro.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.080]   It's a vision pro. I am legally required to say no.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.520]   Yes. Something like that or just tug your ear. We'll know somehow.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   And now let's say hello to Ray Maxwell, longtime friend of the network. I'm Ray.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.360]   Former host of Maxwell's house. Good to drop in and come back for a little visit. Nice to see you
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   all the way up in BC. Ray is not only a colorist and a hang glider aficionado and
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.280]   sail play. Not a player. Oh, there's a difference. Oh, I meant soaring. Yes. I know the difference.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.600]   Yes. And he's unpowered flight. He just kind of glides up there.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.000]   But you drive the lead plane. You drag him up into the air, right? Oh, yeah. I've flown over 50
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.600]   different types of airplanes and nice sliders and I fly the toe plane. Yeah. If the toe pilot
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.560]   isn't there, nothing happens. Yeah. Right. Got to get him up in the air first. Ray is also kind of
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.280]   an auto-didact polymath, an expert in many, many things. And he seems to love the Mac Pro because
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.680]   every time a new Mac Pro comes out, Ray, buy someone some would say more money than sense, Ray.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:27.920]   Are you happy with the new M2 Ultra Mac Pro? Yes. Yes. I'm quite happy with it. I knew what I was
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.120]   getting. I knew why I wasn't getting the studio and later I'll explain all that.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.760]   Actually, that's the real question, isn't it? Yeah.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:47.040]   Yeah. I'm also what's known as an early adopter. I have the last three Mac Pros I ordered on the
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.160]   first day they were available. And of course, that means I'm called an early adopter. Some
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.280]   people call me a fool and others call me an unpaid beta tester for Apple.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.880]   Yeah. You probably, I'm guessing because you're a colorist, have the Pro Display XDR attached to
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   that thing. I have the XDR attached and I have two of the Asus Pro Arts. So I have three. Well,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.880]   here have a look. Oh, look at that. You should be on office hours with you.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   It's going to say we got to get Ray back on. Yeah.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.080]   I have a problem with six o'clock in the morning.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.160]   Alex, I do check in after hours off and on. And they, the first thing I did after I got the new
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.480]   Mac Pro was go on after hours and say, is it all working and work on my video and audio? Yeah.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   That's great. So you're using the Mac Pro right now to talk to us.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.640]   This very moment. Wow. So tell us the specs of the Mac Pro that you got.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   Okay. I got a 128 gig memory. And I got it with two terabytes of SSD.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.960]   And that pretty well, that's
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:22.160]   those are your choices. You get I'm going to think you did you get the 76 core GPU for $1000 more?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   Or did you settle for 60 cores? I settle for 60. Yeah. Yeah. What do you, what are you doing color
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.000]   with the with this thing or what? Oh, yes. I'm doing a Photoshop, Final Cut Pro,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.640]   DaVinci Resolve, you know, all the pieces and there's a number of other. Yeah.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.400]   So I'm just spec'd it out in the US, you're in Canada, but in the US, that would be $8,199.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.760]   It does include a mouse, but does not include wheels. Did you buy the wheels?
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.840]   No. Okay. I did not buy the wheels. Okay. So I will not add the $400 wheels.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   It is a static Mac Pro. It just sits there. It don't roll nowhere. I have to say the design is
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   nice. Is this identical to the old Mac Pro case? The case is virtually identical. From the outside,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:27.840]   you can't tell the difference. Okay. From the inside? Ah, from the inside. Let's, well, let's start.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:36.160]   Now I'm doing the transition from the 2019 Mac Pro, which is Intel based to the 2023,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.360]   which of course is Apple Silicon based. And so let's first have a peek inside my, oh, look at that,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   2019 Mac Pro. Okay. And starting down at the bottom is the power supply. And then the next
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.720]   thing up is I had an internal against Alex's advice. I have a 32 terabyte
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:06.560]   rate array from promise. And then the next thing up is I have the double GPU card,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:15.040]   the Radeon Pro Vega 2 dual. And then the next thing up is the afterburner card, which is the ProRes
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.920]   decoder. And then there's a blank slot shown in this picture, but there was a
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:31.120]   black magic 4k deck link extreme 12g video IO card. And that's my,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:41.600]   that's my universal video in and out. It'll do SDI, HDMI component composite, you name it.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.800]   And so that is what we started with. I do want to, before you go to the next one,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.960]   I do remember you had problems with the promise card initially, right? In fact, they did the
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:01.600]   real Maxwell fix. I'm very proud of the fact that when the 2019 Mac Pro came out,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.840]   there were two system software updates immediately after it was released due to my discovery.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.600]   Yes. You broke it first.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:23.280]   You found the rake in the tall grass. You stepped on that and your broken nose saved everybody else's.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.880]   Right. And we'll say, you know, anyway, it,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.440]   Hold on. You wanted to say, you know, there were two updates so that that rake hit him twice.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:42.960]   So anyway, but the, but, but, but I think that Ray, Ray shows like what the, the target Mac
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.680]   Pro user, you can see that, you know, using up all that card space and putting those in all
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.840]   that space between the studio and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the Mac Pro.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.640]   Let's see the new one, Ray. All right. Just a moment here. So remember it. Oh, it's a lot more open in
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.520]   there. Oh, yeah. Now this is, this is the way it came. This is not with my cards in it.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:17.040]   Yeah. All right. Now my plan, my plan was to put the Ray to Ray in here and to put my
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:24.080]   Blackmagic video card in here. And then there's a third card that I was going to buy. I'll tell
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.080]   you about that later that I wanted to put in here. But as I looked at this very picture,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   before my new 2023 Mac Pro arrived, I said, uh oh, this isn't going to work. So I discovered my
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:49.920]   first problem before the thing even ended up on my front porch. And the first problem is if you,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:59.520]   if you look at the 2019, it has what are called MPX slots, which are PCI slots with an additional
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:08.400]   power connector to the left of in this picture. Now, by the way, notice how the
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.600]   motherboard of this new Mac Pro. Pretty clean as practically nothing. Yeah, that's really
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.560]   remarkable. Everything is in that in that system on a chip, you know, under the little metal thing.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.920]   So anyway, but when I looked at this picture, I said, you know what, my 32 terabyte promise
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:38.400]   Pegasus is not going to work because there's no place for the power connector. And so I immediately
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:46.720]   called Apple and promise and said, Hey, and by the way, if you look at the Apple site, the US site,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.880]   you will see that they still offer the 32 terabyte promise Pegasus. And it says,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:00.960]   we'll work in current Mac Pro, not true, not true, because it doesn't have the new Mac Pro does not
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.800]   have MPX slots. They're straight PCI. Now they are, what is it called, class four, or, you know,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:18.480]   the latest where the 2019 was class three. Anyway, so I call them and I said, is this going to work?
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.040]   And at first they both said, Oh, yeah, it's just needs a PCI connector. And I said, Come on, guys,
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:32.720]   look at the picture. And you know, this isn't going to work. And no, that's the J two.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   This is not the one for four. Yeah, for four. I okay. Because I want to see the listing that says
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:47.440]   it's going to work because that's, you know, yeah, there it is. But this this page is jumping all
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:54.240]   over on me here. Hold on. Scroll down to that. Yes. No, not there. Yeah, there either. Maybe they
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:01.840]   took it off on the US site. There it is right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 32 terabytes. It's sold out.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:10.800]   That's a good slide down to highlight. Yeah. Stop right there and see current version. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:19.600]   Current generation. No, that's a lie. It won't work. Now I talked to Promise and Apple again in the
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:27.040]   second time. And they said, Oh, you know what? You're right. It won't work. Oh my goodness. And
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.200]   Promise said, but we have good news. You have a bunch of R four rate arrays, don't you? And I
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:39.840]   said, yes. And so by now they know you pretty well. Is that what you're saying? Oh, yes. Yeah.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:46.720]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We'll share right 2019. Yeah. Yeah. So, so they said, you realize you can
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.560]   take those eight terabyte hard drives that are in your rate array and you can move them over to an
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   R for a chassis and they'll work just fine. And by the way, they did the only thing you have to do
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:08.320]   is you must install the new Promise Pegasus utility and upgrade firmware and software.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:15.280]   Okay. So you had to open up the case and take the four drives out of there. Is that right? Yes.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.960]   That involved a screwdriver and so forth, removing the hard drives, putting them in the holders for
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.040]   the R for chassis. And they work just fine. Okay. That's the good news. Do you lose any
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.120]   capability because you're doing that? No, they run just they run it. They keep in mind they're
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.680]   they go back a while. So they only run at 600 megabytes a second. Okay. Okay. But they still run
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.720]   at that. So this is your this is your online slow storage. This is not your high speed. That's
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.040]   right. The two terabytes are probably pretty darn fast. Yeah. The SSD is 6000 megabytes per
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.200]   second times fast. Okay. Yeah. But now this brings us to the third card I want to install
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:09.280]   in this machine. And that is a card by OWC, which is the 8M2. And this card fasten your seatbelt.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   When it works properly, it can go at 26,000 megabytes per second.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   And you can get it up to 64 terabytes. I think I'm going to get the 16 terabytes. This is the
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.520]   Excel Excelsior that you're talking about. That's it. Yeah. Wow. That's the card.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.080]   There's only there's a problem though. Notice right under the title directions for 2023
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.800]   Mac Studio and that pro compatibility. Yeah. There's which is known as whoops. It won't work
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:49.040]   just yet, folks. Oh man. So so I'm now waiting for the next system software Apple Apple knows
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.920]   about this and promise and Apple are working together. There's gonna be another Ray Maxwell fix.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.480]   Okay. You got that. It's me. You know, hello Apple is me again.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:06.000]   Well, thank God somebody's doing this, right? And I'm sure there'll be others following in
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.240]   following in your footsteps. But good for you for doing this. So. But can you imagine having
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.600]   that card as your scratch disk for your video work terabytes? Wow. You're gonna get the 8.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.720]   Well, I'm gonna get the 16. Oh, why? Yes. Sure. Why stop? You can go. Yeah, you can go to 64.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.560]   Okay. That's $10,000. You've got you've got the Mac with the police the police pursuit package.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:40.880]   The bully bar. Wow. Okay. So.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.600]   The OWC is probably using somebody else's SSDs in here. I would guess, right? I don't know what
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:57.440]   they use. Yeah, have a look. There's really that's amazing. The problem is if you use their
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:06.320]   soft SSD software, and you install this in a Mac Pro right now, the thing won't boot.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:14.640]   That's too bad. So yeah, I'm using it. I have their little, their little M2 box and have to use
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.040]   software with it. I'm not a fan of software, but I guess it's okay. I'm using that on my
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:26.320]   Mac studio. If you want to. If you want the 26 gigabyte transfer rate, you have to use theirs.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:33.200]   You by the way, the workaround right now is you can buy this plug it in and use Apple raid
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   in the, you know, the disk utility and set it up, but you'll only get 13,000. And by the way,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.160]   you have to set it up on another Mac. You can't set it up on the Mac Pro. And then you have to
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.320]   plug it in after you set it up and striped it with the Apple raid software. So.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.200]   What do you do with all this storage, Ray? That's a lot.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:07.360]   I've lost count. I can't add that. I. Yeah. Well, if you, if you have cameras that shoot Pro Res,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   you do a lot of drone stuff, aren't you? Yeah, I'm doing some drone and, you know,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:23.760]   the thing I shoot with the most now is my, my iPhone 14 Pro. Really? If you had the
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.880]   hustle blood, you don't shoot with your hustle blood. You shoot with your iPhone 14 Pro.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:38.240]   Well, it's 48, 48 megapixels medium format. Absolutely. Yeah. Wow. That's hysterical. Do you
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.720]   find the quality is almost as good? Well, you know, you can go in and pixel peep and, you know,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.800]   decide that it isn't quite the same. I have the, I have the Canon 5D Mark 4 as well.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.120]   And yeah, I have still have the hassle. Blood is now a museum piece. Isn't that funny?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:06.720]   But you took such great images with that. I just, and the depth of focus you were able to achieve.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.920]   What were you doing? I forgot there was something clever. Well, the big thing was a dynamic range
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:18.320]   in those days. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had that. Oh, I can't bring it up quickly, but I had that picture
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:25.360]   I remember at the table where you could see the interior and you could see white clouds and
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:32.480]   it had detail in both the amazing, the dynamic range. Yeah. But nowadays, almost all the cameras
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.760]   can do that. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. So tell us more, give us your thumbnail review of the Mac Pro.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:48.000]   Well, the bottom line is if you need I/O slots and I/O cards that you do want to add to this. Yes.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.760]   Then you want the back Pro. Otherwise, if you don't need that, by all means, get the studio.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.280]   They're exactly the same horsepower. Yeah. Do you run the deck link in there as well?
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.440]   Yes. Yes. You're seeing me through the deck link at this very moment. That's how you control
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   those all those different monitors. Yeah. I have the Blackmagic 6K Pro. That's what you're seeing me.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.760]   Now Alex, he's in 6K, Alex. That's gotta be. Those are fighting words.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:30.720]   Well, that's 7K. Yeah. And we're squishing it down to 720p, by the way. I just want to let you know.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:39.440]   Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's it's the 1080p is still still the the the big player at the moment. We've
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.600]   got a lot of us are working at 4K or 8K. The 12K has I found has been a little excessive.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.320]   I haven't found a lot of use for the 12K. Well, if that's the thing, when you go to 12K,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.960]   now you need a Mac Pro with 3000 terabytes of storage in a tech link card and all that stuff.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.920]   Well, the funny thing is the big limit like with Blackmagic cameras is really how to get it
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.360]   recorded. Yeah. So when you record a, you know, it's getting a drive fast enough and just
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:15.440]   the throughput, just the USB C on the 12K on the Blackmagic 12K isn't fast enough to really get us
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.160]   the compression rate that we want at 8K or 12K. If I'm doing like 8K 120, I'm still stuck at about
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:29.440]   900 megs a second coming out of that. But it's still 26 gigabytes a second should be fast enough.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.160]   Shouldn't. Well, you can't plug that into the camera. So yeah, so you're it's getting it out of
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.800]   the camera is the problem at the moment for most of these things. And then once you get into it,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.840]   you're absolutely right. You have, but that drive speed is so important because you're,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.800]   especially if you start stacking, you know, you got three, four, five tracks of data,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.160]   and then you're starting to apply. And this is where you start, you start applying effects and
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.280]   you start doing other things, but that drive speed delivering those frames to the CPU is a big deal.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.800]   So that speed is, is really key. Ray, you've been doing this even longer than I have. Is it kind of
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.680]   still thrilling to you to see how much you can, how much power you could put on your desk,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.800]   how much storage, how much speed. Oh, absolutely. And AI is, you know, I'm just
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:23.920]   the selection capability in Photoshop and on my iPhone now, you know, the ability to point
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.240]   at something and select it. I used to spend 20 minutes selecting something in a photo and
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:39.520]   the horsepower and AI, all of this just blows me away and the generative feel now in Photoshop.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.680]   And have you played with a firefly? I was going to ask about firefly. Have you played with that
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:52.000]   a little bit? Oh, yes. Yes. In fact, when we get to plugging my friend's book, the cover was done
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.320]   with mid journey. Let's see this. So you did this cover. This is a book about AI robots, a sci-fi
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.160]   book from a good friend of Ray's. Take down the lower third so we could see his name Guy Amaga,
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.400]   super earth mother. And you did that mid journey. Alex probably wouldn't have recognized it.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.280]   He's a mid journey guy here. Definitely looks like great mid journey work. Great mid journey work.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:26.880]   Yeah. You're using 5.2 now, Ray. Yeah, I believe so. Yes. He did it. I did it. Oh, he did it. Oh, nice.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.920]   Yes. He did the cover. Illustrators all over the world are grinding their teeth as we speak.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:40.480]   Oh, I know. I know. It's this is, you know, talk about the looms and the luddites. Yeah.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.160]   Here they come with their beds. Yeah. Here they come. What's what's guys book about? There's a friend
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.640]   of yours you actually went to school with. I went to school with him at the University of Missouri.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:24:02.880]   We met in the Ham Radio Club. Oh, wow. And we're both our engineers and he ended up moving to Vancouver,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:10.160]   lives here in Vancouver. And after he retired, he started writing hard science fiction. Everything
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:20.560]   in his science fiction is possible. And in this book, I want you to imagine that we're at a time
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.120]   when things aren't going so well here on Earth and there's a moon base and there's a kind of
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:33.520]   interesting character who has built a rocket ship that can travel between the stars.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:44.000]   And he has built an AI, several AIs that are going to care for a library of genetic material
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:55.760]   and some incubators, if you will, to incubate this new genetic material. And he will modify that
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:03.440]   the AI will modify the genetic material to suit the exoplanet that is 20,000 years away.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:11.920]   And so they're going to send this ship on a 20,000 year trip. And when it gets there,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:19.360]   it's going to create human beings that are adapted to this new exoplanet. Now, what could possibly
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:26.000]   go wrong? And by the way, the entire thing is exclusive on Amazon Kindle right now through
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.760]   at the end of August. So if you want to read it, it's Kindle Select. And then the print book and
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.480]   ebook comes out everywhere September 1st. You can go to kinetic. This is, I think this is his site,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.600]   right? Kineticworlds.net. Guy Embrica. Yeah. And read all about it.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.200]   Ever since he was in the Peace Corps in Niger, Africa, he goes by Guy.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:58.000]   Guy. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Guy Embrica. Actually, Guy is great. Not Guy. I like Guy. Good for him.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.920]   And you can cut me Leo. So Ray, if somebody came to you and said,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:13.520]   all right, I want to buy the most powerful Mac. Would you approve of a purchase of a Mac Pro,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.280]   or would you steer him towards the studio? I think you probably steer him towards the studio. Yeah.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:25.680]   Yeah. I would steer him to studio unless he needs PCI IO. Because that's what the Mac Pro is all
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:34.560]   about. If you want PCI IO, or you want these super fast SSDs to plug in, then you're going to need
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:43.920]   to go to the Mac Pro. And, you know, that here's the bottom line. This thing is anywhere from two
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:53.040]   to seven times faster than the 2019 Mac Pro. Wow. And, of course, you can put much faster
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:03.200]   storage in it than the 2019. Because, by the way, it's only Class 3. And so, you know, the new
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:11.440]   23 Mac Pro is going to get you up to 26,000 megabytes per second. Just OWC.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:18.080]   Just amazing. All of the speed and stuff. I mean, again, going, I mean, I go back to 80, 80 days and
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:28.800]   yeah, 400 k/6 inch floppy disk. And, you know, this just blows my mind. And again, that's why I'm
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:36.320]   an early adopter. It's fun. The last three Mac Pros I bought, I bought them on the first day they were
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.880]   available for order. Is there anything you feel like you can't do with Apple Silicon that you were
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.600]   able to do with your Intel Mac Pro? I haven't run into it yet. I am very pleased with how all of my
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:56.000]   Intel-based software runs. Is it a two-star remarkable, isn't it? It's just remarkable. Yeah.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.920]   I, and of course, most of the major apps, all of the big apps that I'm running, they're all
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:10.880]   universal. And they're already, the transfer over was quite easy using the migration assistant.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:18.640]   And I haven't had, I haven't hit any problems other than, oh, that one problem I missed telling you
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:25.040]   about was I did have problems with the Blackmagic card. This was really weird. I still don't know how
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:33.360]   we fixed it. I hate that. I put the Blackmagic card in and the system software said, yes, I see the card.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:41.200]   But the desktop video card or desktop video software from Blackmagic said, I can't find the card.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.640]   And so I called up Blackmagic and they were very helpful and they know me as well.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:56.000]   And anyway, they said, well, go back a couple of versions and let's try that. And we went through
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.960]   two or three different versions. And then he said, okay, go back to the latest version. We went back
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.480]   to the latest version and it was suddenly it worked. Oh, I love computing. I swear to God.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.240]   That's just nuts. Which which which deck link again was that the 8k?
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:21.360]   That's the 4k. Okay. Deck link extreme 12g. Okay. So if you're having trouble getting it working,
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.760]   go to an older version of the software and then go to the newer and everything should be just fine.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.240]   It sounds that's what happened. I hate that. That sort of thing.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.440]   There was, you know, a little it just you need a little that little hitch and it's get along and
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.880]   you just need a little nudge to just just get going. Well, Ray, it's always a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.200]   I miss working with you on Maxwell's house. I think we probably I'll have to bring that back in the
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.520]   club. We'll bring it back a lot of the older shows in the club. But I'm just thrilled that you're
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:30:01.840]   still buying the most expensive computers out there. And by the way, on the first day that Vision
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:10.080]   Pro is available. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're going to count on you early 2024 for
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.800]   your review of Vision Pro Ray Maxwell. And I want to hear how accurate the color is because that's
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:21.600]   Ray's real real field here. Right. If I if I can be a spoil sport here, you realize that
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:27.840]   are you really testing it if you're not able to be wearing a Vision Pro while also looking at
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.200]   another Vision Pro objectively? I really think you should buy two. You need to.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.640]   Of course. Do you have any other Max or is this is this the only Mac that you use?
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:48.000]   I have I have another laptop. I have the by the way, you were looking at images from my
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:57.040]   iPod Pro. What? Wait a minute. What? Your iPod? Yeah. Sorry. iPad. Oh God.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.680]   I was really confused now. Well, you know, I figured out a way if you revert the version on the
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.920]   iPod, you can get it to show pictures. Okay. Your iPad Pro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes a lot of
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.040]   yes. Now, what are you switching? What are you switching cameras with?
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:18.800]   The ATM mini mini. Okay. Very nice. You know, you know, you get involved with Alex. All right.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:27.280]   No, I know. I know. And you get into trust me to to after hours and so forth. And everybody asked
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.880]   me said, Oh, you're in this group said, what does it cost to join? And I said, Oh, it's absolutely
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:40.480]   free. Of course, after after I worked with this group for a while, I think the last count, I had
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:49.680]   spent $8,000. There's a little pressure to keep up with the disease. Yeah. I have the ATM mini. I
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:56.400]   have the mix pre three. I can go down the list. Oh, you and I are in the same boat. I know exactly
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.320]   how you feel. What about the extreme treat is between a rate and an Alex?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.520]   Oh, it's like a euro where they try to keep it to keep it. They're a pair of
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.160]   parents. Yeah, try to keep it on par. Remember, it's even more with me because I'm in Canada.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:16.000]   Yeah, that's true. Exactly. Ray Maxwell, what a pleasure. It's great to see you. Thank you for
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   your review of the new Mac Pro. I'm thrilled that you got it and got it all fixed up and working great.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.040]   And I'm very happy with it. Everything is clicking ticky boo. And as soon as I get that
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.480]   OWC card, I'll be a very happy camper. Oh, yeah. I want to hear about that too. Thank you, Ray.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.200]   And maybe we'll see you in after hours at office hours. Global sometimes soon.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.480]   Take care. Ray Maxwell, ladies and gentlemen, from our host of Maxwell's House,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.560]   Colorist, Hang Glider, Pilot. No, I did I sawing not hang gliders.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.640]   So we're in power.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:57.600]   So we're in sale plane. Yeah, pilot and and man about town. Thank you, Ray. Have a great one.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.320]   We're going to take a little break. We come back. We have lots of Apple news to talk about as well
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:09.200]   with Jason Jason Snell who somebody Jason. She said, she stayed quiet in the background there,
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.960]   but I know you were. Were you drooling or were you just thinking, no, I'm not. You know, I, I was
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.840]   on a podcast where I referred to the Mac Pro sort of negatively this week. And so I'm glad that
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:25.200]   there's some equal time over here. Time for the Mac Pro. We'll talk about that. We're going to call
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:32.240]   you on the carpet after these words from Zokdok. You know, that feeling you get when you find
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.720]   the thing, you know, the thing you've been searching for in the internet, you spend hours researching
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:45.280]   and reading thousands of reviews and you, you know, you finally find it. This thing, be it, I don't
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:53.120]   know, sparkly disco pants. This is the stuff I buy on Instagram late at night designer dog hoodies,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:59.520]   whatever it is, you know, just checks all your boxes. Five stars rise at 48 hours. How is it you
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.680]   can get perfectly machined aluminum pillboxes in, in just two days? But if you want a good doctor,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.680]   it could take forever to get an appointment. Why is that? And how do you even know if they're good?
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:15.440]   Where's all the reviews? Well, there is a way. It's called Zokdok, a place to find and book great
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:22.560]   doctors who have amazing reviews, many with appointments within 24 hours. Zokdok is a free app
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.600]   where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments online. We're talking about booking
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   appointments with thousands of top rated patient reviewed doctors and specialists. You can even
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.920]   filter specifically for ones who take your insurance or are located near you. And it's not just doctors,
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:45.680]   almost any condition you're searching for, dentists and chiropractors. And I was looking for gerontologists,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:52.320]   they got them all with verified reviews from real patients, actual patients, not bots.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:59.360]   The average wait time to see a doctor booked on Zokdok 24 to 48 hours. So sure, you can get those
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.840]   disco pants tomorrow. You can get a doctor tomorrow too. That's it. You can even score same day
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.680]   appointments. Once you find the doc you want, you can book them immediately with just a few
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.240]   app taps. No more waiting awkwardly on hold with a receptionist. This is simply put the
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:19.440]   best, easiest, fastest way to find the right doctor for you. Go to Zokdok.com/macbreak
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.000]   and download the Zokdok app for free. I know you can get it, you know, just go to the app store. But
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   would you do me a favor and go to the website? Zokdok.com/macbreak. That way they know you saw it here.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.720]   zocdoc.com/macbreak. It's free. It's fast. It's easy. Find a book, a top rated doctor today.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:47.920]   zocdoc.com/macbreak. Apple put out a big emergency update yesterday
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:56.320]   to iOS and Mac OS. I rushed what I read about it, the rapid security update,
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.640]   rapid security response update. I rushed to my iPad and my iPhone and my Mac to download it and it was
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:09.440]   gone. They pulled it. How fast did they pull it? Was it like 10 minutes? It feels like...
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.560]   I think it was much less than an hour, I think. It was very quick. And the reason being what
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:21.840]   that it broke some websites, according to reports on Mac rumors forums and on Reddit,
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:30.240]   Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Zoom and other websites started giving a warning about not
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:40.320]   being supported on Safari. Oops. It was an active zero day. That's a little concerning in WebKit.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:50.400]   But they did apparently change the Safari user agent to identify it as patched with a
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   parenthesis, a parenthesis, and some websites, which you are... I think honestly you want to
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.480]   blame the website who are looking specifically at the user agent said, "No."
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:08.560]   When Facebook and Instagram aren't inaccessible after an update, that's not Facebook and Instagram
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.120]   problem. That's the problem if you pushed out an update like that.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.800]   Yeah, but that's also why all the browser info is not real, because everybody lies about it,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.600]   because they want to maintain compatibility and it's like Mozilla, right? They're all like Mozilla.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.120]   And so I get it, but it's weird that whatever string they should have tested,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.080]   right? Well, let's change the string. Oh, it breaks everything we can't change the string.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.400]   And that's a mistake. I was going to make a joke here that their rapid security response
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.000]   obviously means that it's only out there. It's very... It's very... You have very little time.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.760]   A little bit of time. Get it quick. Are you going to miss it? I just missed it.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.840]   And I felt... I felt at a loss. I was sad. I mean, you're going to prioritize the zero day
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.600]   over maybe some last minute testing of things like user string agent strings in your web browser,
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.640]   but whoops. I guess it's a testament to how urgent they felt it was, right? They saw it was active
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.520]   in the wild. They go, "Oh, crap. We got to fix this." And they didn't have time to test it.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:10.080]   The user agent is how the browser identifies itself to sites, its visits. And you can see,
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.000]   as you said, there's a lot of... Most browsers lie and say they're Mozilla.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.480]   Just for compatibility reasons. And apparently these websites were looking, they saw Safari,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.240]   and they saw then, "Prenthesis A, Prenthesis Z it. Oh, oh dear." I don't know about you.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:35.600]   Which is not the right response either. I guess Apple's probably doing the right thing,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:41.040]   because they... Of course, they could have just taken the A off and shipped it. And I guess they
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:50.240]   decided not to do that. Apple says it will be a response, which has a parenthesis B in it.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.560]   It will be available soon to address the issue.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:59.520]   So, okay. That's way more serious than that Mothus. That's Admiral Grace Hopper point of
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:06.880]   pound. This is a bug, maybe. Yeah. But at least now it's easy to revert a rapid security update.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.680]   In the olden days, once you updated, Apple was like, "Why would you ever want to undo an update?"
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.520]   That's right. Because the first time something like this happens and you're stuck with a problem
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.160]   until Apple fixes it, that's when people, like by default say, "I'm not going to trust a security
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.080]   update until everybody else's..." Until the end of the month when I don't need to use this Mac for
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.040]   anything. And that's when it's most critical to actually play these damps. Yeah. This is the one
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:34.480]   you really want, and you want to apply right away. Apple has a page, support page, HT-213-827.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:42.720]   If you applied Rapid Security Response iOS 16.5.1, Prenthesis A, here's how to roll it back. And it
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.760]   turns out you can just go to Settings and remove it. Yeah. On the Mac, it's a little bit more
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.720]   complicated. You have to go to About This Mac, then more information. Under Mac OS, click the
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:57.520]   info button next to the version number, click Remove, and restart. Click to confirm. Much easier
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:06.400]   on iOS. There's a Remove Security Response entry in the version settings. I do think that was a
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.840]   negotiated piece inside of Apple deciding that if we are going to push these things out without an
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.400]   immense amount of testing, we need to make... I will approve this so long as there's a way to
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.800]   undo it and trace the patch, create some more problems than it solves. I could really see there
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.520]   being an argument about saying, "Hey, we can't do this without having a real review system in place."
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:33.600]   Thank you. Right. Makes a lot of sense. It's Prime Day. Don't everybody turn off the show at once.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.360]   There goes John Ashley. We lost him. So many offers on string lights. Oh my god.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:48.480]   I have not bought anything. Actually, there is a pretty good deal on Amazon.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.640]   Does this once you write the Prime Day? There is a pretty good deal on an iPad Mini,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.000]   which is like 120 bucks off. And I like the iPad Mini. Yeah.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.200]   So yeah, I keep I keep waffling on upgrading my Kindle, knowing that I need something that has
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.240]   USB-C and is a larger screen, but I definitely don't want another Kindle. And every time I look at
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.200]   like one of the really nice e-readers that Jason recommends, I'm like, "Yeah, but for a little bit
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.320]   more, I can just have an iPad Mini, even like a last generation one. It doesn't last 30 hours on
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.560]   battery. It's going to be a really nice e-reader and it can be the thing that I carry when I don't
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.520]   even want to carry my iPad Pro with me." I love that device. I'm always... The Mini is
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.960]   my bedside computer, basically, because it's small enough. It's a little bigger than a phone.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.320]   It's too small to get you into any trouble. I'm not going to start a project. I've started
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.160]   projects on my iPad thinking that, "Oh, I'm just going to read comics. I just need this big screen."
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.280]   And then, "Hey, when if I just open up the Ulysses and just drop down these couple notes,
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.640]   then hey, it's 6 a.m. and I need to be somewhere two hours." Okay.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:58.000]   That's the thing is too small to get you into any trouble. I get in trouble with the smallest
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.200]   things, I believe. Is there anything to read into this price? Is there any reason not to buy it from
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   Amazon? I really really like it. I don't think so. Apple and Amazon now have a deal that actually
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.640]   involves... It ships from Apple, right? Yeah. Basically, they got Amazon to clear a bunch of
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:24.480]   Apple product resellers of questionable quality out of the store in exchange for making a deal
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.840]   Amazon and Apple. That stuff is pretty solid. And if you get a good deal, it's a good deal. I'm unclear
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:38.480]   whether there's a new mini coming or whether it's just that they've got lots and they want to move
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:45.120]   some. And the beauty of being Apple is your margins are so huge that you can discount a little bit
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.720]   if you want to move some stuff out of the channel and they can manage it. 120 bucks off was $500
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:56.240]   now, 380. That's the only thing I'm going to mention. Oh, but Leo, there's another good deal here.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.320]   Oh, wait a minute. The Elgato Stream Deck, which we like, 15k.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.680]   John, how did you know I literally bought that during the show? You're kidding. I did seriously.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.200]   I literally bought that during the show. I'm going to buy this one and then there's the one with the
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   knobs for $20 off. That's actually... I bought that one. You lose a lot of buttons there.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.120]   I like automating stuff myself and little twisty knobs and stuff are not very automatable.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:27.200]   So I'm skeptical of that one. I haven't tried it, but I'm a little skeptical of that. I wanted a
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.960]   newer Stream Deck, so I got that. I have it. You can see that it's not plugged in. Oh, wow.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.920]   I figured out... I use it with Resolve. Some of the encoders work. These encoders work pretty well,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.320]   but I haven't found it. And as a general purpose, I actually bought another Elgato
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.760]   right before the show because I've been using it. I have three Stream Deck right now plugged
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.560]   into different computers and I was like, "Oh, another one." But wait. Yeah, that was my thought too.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:01.040]   But wait because you could buy it for Amazon or get the same price at Elgato. They're doing
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:07.120]   their own prime deals and you get a little cover for your... Here's the problem with buying
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.360]   anything directly. This is the big advantage that Amazon has. It's whole foods.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.920]   Oh, whole foods. You pick your stuff up and just take it back. Oh, I know. If I don't like it,
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.680]   I don't even have to put it back in a box. I literally take it the whole foods and hand it to them.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:30.960]   And the credit is put back in my account in a day, like we're hours. And it's just so seamless
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.160]   that I... At first, I thought I do return a lot more now than I did before. I used to be like,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.440]   "Oh, I'll get around to it. Never got around to it." But I now... The lock-in is super serious
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:48.480]   because if Elgato, I have tried to... I have attempted to return things. The return policy
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.400]   and the processes... Well, that's a good point. That's a good point. That's on Amazon.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:58.800]   And really, do you really need a faceplate for your Steam Deck, honestly? I mean... No. No.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:05.360]   No, you do not. So a free $10. Face Deck is not going to convince you to get it from Elgato.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.280]   No, it's not Amazon. You're right. It's really... I was asking about this.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.800]   I have never returned anything, but it is a really great way to return stuff.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.680]   And they just... I think they throw it... Somebody told me they throw it in a container out back.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.400]   And then the truck... No, like... It's a box. Oh, you were telling me. Yes.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.720]   Yeah. So they have a big box there. And what they do is they scan your stuff on the way in.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.360]   Yeah. So they... You have it there. They'll tell you if it's more than a couple hundred...
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.680]   More than a hundred-fifty dollars they'll want you to put it back in the box,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.080]   but if it's less than that, generally they just say just bring it back. In fact,
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.560]   they tell you not to put it back in the box. Anyway, so then you hand it to them.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.480]   They scan your phone. They throw it in a box. The box now has a... As a contents in it.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.760]   Random. And then people bid on these, right? I don't think bid on them or Amazon,
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:46:00.000]   but people buy the boxes from Amazon and then they sell them on eBay.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.720]   Like, I mean, that's kind of old. There's a business model for people to buy these boxes of
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.760]   used stuff in Amazon. So they're buying them, you know, pennies on the dollar from Amazon.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.800]   And Amazon has figured out the math that it's better than throwing them away,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.440]   which is what they were doing before. They're just throwing everything away that you sent back.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:21.360]   And ScooterX tells us, by the way, this just in the Elgato Stream Deck app for iOS now offers six
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:28.400]   free buttons. Yes, it's true. It's true. It's silly that they charge for more buttons,
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.720]   but it does mean that if you are a Stream Deck fan and you're traveling without your Stream Deck,
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.600]   you can use your iPhone as a Stream Deck and get six buttons. Free. They're not free on Android.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:42.160]   Just want you to know. Okay.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:49.360]   Somebody put the... Thank you for reminding me. I just bought a two terabyte SSD.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:56.320]   I wasn't going to mention Prime Day at all. It's just like there are things that are...
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.920]   I don't just scroll through the list. It's more like I'm waiting to buy storage on days like this.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   I was like, "Yeah, I want to get an M2 SSD." Okay, that's half-priced.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.520]   Okay. Okay. I'm going to close the window or else this is going to be in the list.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.720]   Yeah, I can tell you right now. I'm going to be in the red on this show.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.760]   And we haven't even gone to Alex's picks yet. God dang.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:22.800]   But I don't think you should buy a Mac Pro with a deck link card. I'm just saying. I think
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:28.160]   in the promise storage, I think you should stay away from that. There is testing in from Linus Tech
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:35.520]   Tips. I have not seen this video. Who put this in the show notes? I did. I saw it last night and
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   I thought it was so interesting that I actually generated transcripts so other people could read it.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:45.920]   Tell us about this. It was a really good in-depth review in that it's not just, "Oh, well,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.520]   you know, it's too expensive. It's not really that much faster." Like they were looking at first,
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:57.760]   they start with the marketing stuff, the charts about, "Oh, here's how much faster the M2 is
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.800]   than last year's M1. And here's how faster it is than this Core i9." And A, pointing out that,
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:08.160]   "Okay, I see some graph theory where the legends aren't actually labeled. And I see benchmarks
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.600]   here where you didn't actually explain what the benchmark did." The famous Apple graphs, right?
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.760]   Yeah. They're comparing it to an Intel machine from five years ago and things.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:24.560]   Right. Yeah. And so they were very, I think Linus actually went specifically and said that the,
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.440]   I'm not quoting here, but that the marketing images here,
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:33.280]   marketing claims are just malarkey. It's incrementally faster, but not monumentally faster.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:39.280]   It's not that much faster than comparable Intel hardware. In many cases, it's slower
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:45.760]   than comparable Intel hardware. However, there was huge praise for just the power management.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:51.200]   That's what Apple often does is they say power per watt instead of raw power.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:59.040]   They're making the point that the entire, the entire M2 Ultra Mac studio consumes less power
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   than just the Intel CPU or just the graphics card in the PC that they built to stack.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.520]   But if you're looking for speed and you're plugging it in, you may not care.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.960]   Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that they, I think was very balanced and fair in that they were
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.280]   basically saying that actually in the first 10 minutes, five minutes, they said that if all they
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:25.360]   said was this is more better and more faster, it's the new, it's the new M2 Ultra studio.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.520]   All would be Jake. It was just that they were making specific claims that they couldn't reproduce.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.600]   Actually, I think that they were also trying to reproduce like the black magic studio
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.400]   a benchmark that they, that they mentioned and they couldn't reproduce it. And even black
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.920]   magic, when they talked to black magic, they couldn't reproduce it either. They're claiming.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:49.360]   So this is, it just seems like a really, really weird set of claims. Again, it's,
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.520]   they weren't saying don't buy it. They actually, they were the other point they were making is that
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:50:00.320]   if you, if you don't necessarily need a Mac, you can buy a comfortably equipped or even over equipped
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:06.160]   Windows box for the price of like a top of the line, for the price of a top of the line M2 Ultra
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.920]   studio, you can get a top of the line Windows box that has easily the same specs and still have
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:19.200]   $1,700 left for another Mac mini or or an M2 Mac book. And so I thought these is,
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.480]   well, I like about it. They were really, but are they anti apple? I mean, is there some bias here or
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:30.640]   no? I would, if everyone has bias, there's no such thing as a lack of bias. And also they are
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:37.520]   primarily like a PC oriented. Yeah, I mean, largely, you have to use Windows is one of the disadvantages
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.760]   of that box. Yeah, exactly. And they, and they point, and he, and they point this out very fairly,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.720]   that look, if you want a Mac, that's a fair point, that's perfectly fine. However, one thing,
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.200]   one thing that I really, really respect about them is that they're putting a lot of money into a
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.520]   really expensive testing lab. So it's not just, Hey, we ran some benchmarks, we copied down the
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:02.400]   numbers. It's no, we actually have like commercial testing equipment for power supplies, commercial
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.800]   testing equipment for power consumption and thermals. And so when they make a claim, they at least,
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.200]   they will hear is our data. If we screwed up, it's going to be very clear to everybody how we
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   screwed it up. So they're not just just saying, Oh, well, you know, rah, raw team windows.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.360]   Mac sucks. They are the reason I put it in the show notes is that it did seem significant that
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.720]   they were very, very firm on the idea that the marketing stuff that you see on the product page
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.960]   is not something that you should even take with a grain of salt that it does seem to be
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.640]   actively misleading. And in some places, maybe even deceptive.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.440]   The way I view this video is that it's not even a video about a computer. It's a video
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.000]   teaching people about how marketing works. Yeah. And in that, I think it's actually valuable.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.400]   I should just claim here that a lot of the people who used to work in the Mac world lab work in the
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.880]   performance marketing group at Apple now, and they are doing, I will say this, because I think it is
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.240]   left as a question in that video, they're doing real tests and they're getting real results. Now,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.800]   let's talk about what they what Apple markets, right? Does Apple publish all the numbers? No,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:09.360]   they don't. They leave it to your imagination. Do they choose the hardest comparison products to
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.600]   compare their product to? No, they do not. They choose the most favorable comparison. Although I
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:22.000]   would argue that an M2 Mac is probably, in terms of upgradeers, it's probably more likely somebody
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.800]   coming from Intel than coming from an M1, because it is incremental from there. So I can understand
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.520]   it, but they're also going to choose the most favorable because it is marketing, right? And then
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.320]   do they, this is, and again, I don't know this from those people, I just know it because I know it from
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:41.680]   dealing with Apple for many years, have they done 50 different tests, and then cherry picked the
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.960]   five that look the best for Apple? Absolutely. And have they done, in this case with the
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:52.720]   Linus Tech Tip video, have they done a bad job of properly footnoting, which they used to do,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.520]   I'm going to say it, they used to do a better job of doing this, properly footnoting and disclosing
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:03.040]   what test got run and what the configurations were so that you can reproduce the results.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.400]   And I think the answer here is kind of no, right? Like that, that the most damning thing in this
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.840]   video for me was that Linus Tech Tips is sort of like, we don't know, we don't understand
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:19.680]   what this test is or how they got the result. And the problem with that is then you can't reproduce
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:25.200]   it. So I think that that's, like I said, I think this is a good educational video. Everything Apple
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:33.680]   says in its marketing about the numbers is true, but the only share the numbers that are the most
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.480]   favorable for Apple. And that is always the case. And that's why you should always look to independent
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:44.640]   sources of information. So in some ways, what this video is, is learn about marketing and why we
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:49.200]   spend a lot of money doing our own lab testing. And to that, I've got to give them credit. The
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.840]   PC versus Mac thing I rolled my eyes at because it's like, oh, you could get a PC that does that.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.520]   It's like, yeah, but if you're buying a Mac, you're probably buying it because you want to use a Mac
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:01.840]   and not a PC. But the rest of it, I mean, that's the truth of it. It's marketing.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.720]   I am always, when I'm watching an Apple presentation, I am always noticing like,
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:14.000]   what did they choose as the comparison computer? And you've seen it with the M1 and the M2,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.080]   especially the M2, they talk a lot about Intel computers partially because a lot of
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:24.000]   upgraders are coming from Intel, but also that's a bigger number. So it's better for marketing purposes.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.080]   Yeah. And there are a lot of times during a keynote, whereas I will literally put like a
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.600]   symbol that means, wow, what an interesting way of phrasing that that they chose. I'm going to
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:39.280]   look into this. I will say, however, I do think this went a little marketing is marketing or
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.840]   absolutely right that they're always going to the purpose is not to produce an independent
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.360]   set of test results to get a certification from the FCC or anything. It is to get people excited
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.560]   about getting this new product. It's all but I always think about these things though as like
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:02.880]   committing a foul like in basketball, it's like, okay, you're going to that you played high
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:08.800]   contact basketball. That's professional sports. But then, okay, you drove an elbow right into
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.440]   somebody's eye socket. At this point, I'm going to have to flag you on that with that's that's
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:20.320]   severe playing a hard ball. Yeah. And the thing about the footnotes, I mean, I think that's the key
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:27.440]   to this performance marketing is it ought to be reproducible and understandable, even if you're
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:32.000]   cherry picking, right? Even if you're choosing comps that are the easy comps instead of harder
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.840]   comps, it's marketing, we get it. But when you put numbers down, there should be enough information
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.760]   attached and they footnote everything. If you've ever looked at an Apple reviewers guide or an
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.160]   Apple website, there are so many footnotes. And sometimes I look for the footnotes and I can't
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.440]   find them, which is very weird, right? Whereas I wait, what is there? Where's number? Small number
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.760]   six. It's not I can't find it. But if you're going to do this with performance marketing,
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:59.520]   that's where you get into trouble, I think is when you make a claim and somebody like Linus
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.720]   Tech's tip, Tech Tips is looking very, they're trying so hard to understand what you're claiming
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:10.880]   and they can't figure it out. That shouldn't happen. You should be able to look at the footnote
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.720]   and get the answer of what they did. And that's the most troubling thing in this whole report to me
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:21.040]   is like, the when they and Blackmagic can't verify a Blackmagic test. What is that about?
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.280]   Right? Like, that's not great. This isn't like some YouTuber like running a Cinebench
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.880]   and saying, Oh my God, the Cinebench score is a terrible. And then like, right in the comments
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.880]   is like, Yeah, you do know that the Cinebench test has not been optimized for Apple solo kit yet.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.600]   And maybe it's not a good and good metric. Well, even in this video, he's running stuff that's
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.240]   not optimized for metal and so. Right. So this is the hard thing. I mean, you know,
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.600]   go ahead, Alex. Yeah, all I was going to say is that is that almost nothing's been optimized.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.200]   You know, and so the thing is, is that there's been a lot of stuff that's made universal.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.520]   It'll run really well on the M1, but it's not really taking full advantage of the libraries.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.360]   And that is important. I mean, if you talk, if you look at, you know, the kind of things that,
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:05.840]   again, we go back to Zoom ISO, if you look at what zoom did, or, you know, what the liminal team did,
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:12.160]   is they're squeezing an enormous amount of performance out of a Mac Mini. Because they're
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:18.320]   taking full advantage of the entire, they're optimizing and working with Apple to tie all
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.280]   those little things in and you're getting, you know, eight 1080p streams out of a little Mac Mini.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.880]   And so when you when you really talk about optimizing, really talking about using the libraries,
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:33.360]   there's, you know, I think that there's still a lot of a lot that a lot of developers are leaving
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.520]   on the table for a variety of reasons. Mostly that it's a lot, it's expensive to rewrite all the code
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.440]   into, you know, to optimize it. And it's, you know, it's only part of the market.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:47.200]   But universal and optimized are truly optimized, you know, for the platform or two different things.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.360]   And we're going to see, continue to see that grow across that platform. And so I think that,
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:56.160]   you know, I think it's hard because, you know, any tests are going to show some things to be faster.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:03.200]   And I do think that, you know, I was actually talking to Andy about this a little earlier,
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.000]   which was, you know, you can build a PC that's going to be faster than the Mac Studio. I mean,
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.320]   you know, at a lower price, you know, but you have to build it. Like you're not going to buy it.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.720]   And and it's got, you know, it's not going to be as sleek and it's not going to be a Mac, you know,
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:21.280]   and a lot of people who are buying it want to have a Mac. And it's important to have these higher end
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:27.040]   Macs because the people who are buying them, like, there's definitely solutions that I need
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:32.400]   that require more than the Mac Pro. You know, that there are $20,000 boxes, they've got a bunch
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:37.920]   of quadro cards in them. I need the Nvidia chip sets. I need all of those things. So it's not that
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.640]   Apple is going to give you the highest end of all of those things. But as a Mac user, knowing that I
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:50.320]   can buy in at $500 and seamlessly go up to about $12,000 and get enough performance for what 90%
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:56.080]   of the market, maybe 99% of the market needs is a is a pretty good, you have to have that whole
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:59.840]   gamut. And I think Apple's doing that pretty well. I do, I do agree that, you know, they,
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.600]   everybody is finding, but everybody, every manufacturer is going to find the bench sets that make the
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.920]   most sense for them. And that's why that's why there are magazines and other things.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.200]   Yeah. And line of tech tips. Unfortunately, there really aren't the magazines anymore.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:21.680]   Well, and sites like Anantec and Extreme Tech and Tom's Hardware of all, Anant is still doing
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:27.120]   benchmarks. I having worked with Patrick Norton for years, he used to work at CD Labs and did was
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:34.080]   their benchmark guy. I really know that benchmarks lie just as much as statistics and marketing
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:42.240]   graphs. And it's very difficult for an end user to know how much they, I'll be honest,
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:46.400]   I just don't know how much they matter. Like, you know, okay, that's the point. I agree.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.240]   Like, I don't know how much like when we say, Oh, well, this is faster. Well, I know that it's
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.120]   all I know is my Mac studio, which is the first version of this Mac studio. And only a Mac is
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:59.200]   one of the fastest machines I've ever had. You know, and it does all the things that I needed to do.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.480]   And now I know that they're releasing one that is incrementally better than the one that I have.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.080]   And when I upgrade, I'll upgrade to that. You know, I think that because I think that the other
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.040]   thing about line of tech tips is they're like, are you going to shoot for them, Linux PC, Mac,
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.600]   or all just outputs, you know, like they're there any, they're even hardware, you know, to them,
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.480]   because they mostly use PCs and Linux and the Mac. Well, I'm going to go a little farther. I
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.760]   think if you're watching any YouTuber, all this stuff is optimized for clicks, not for content.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:34.560]   Right. Right. Sure. And so, you know, the title of this is Apple fans start typing your angry
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:40.800]   comments now. The thumbnail, of course, is all of Linus's LTT's videos is some
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.680]   aghast. I mean, it does look, I'm not saying it doesn't do a great job. I'm not saying he does
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:53.680]   not now have the resources of even something like ZD Labs. But I also think there's an editorial
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.400]   slant to this that you can't actually, it's marketing. You can't ignore it.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   I was just to take it slightly more gently is I'll say, you know, his primary market
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:11.120]   are PC users. And number one and number two is that he is, he is again, assuming that these
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.280]   are like, you're going to make a choice based on performance and price about whether you're using
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:22.080]   a Mac or a PC, which from a PC and Linux user view might make sense. But Mac users are using Macs.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.920]   We just want to know that they're going to be powerful enough to do what we want to do.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.480]   We're not really, we're like, we're using a cross to use a PC.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.920]   If you're using cross platform tool, you're using the VINCE Resolve or Photoshop, it's reasonable
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.200]   to ask because, you know, our editors use Windows, not, they're not really using Windows, they're
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.880]   using Premiere and they very rarely see Windows. It's reasonable to say, what's the best machine
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.800]   to run this particular program? That's a different group of people than most of us who are saying,
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.200]   well, I'm going to run a variety. It's a general purpose PC for me. And I want good performance,
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.960]   but I also want fit finish. I want an operating system, etc, etc, etc.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.160]   - Well, Leah, when you say that the benchmarks are not necessarily, you know, fair, I think that
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.320]   what's interesting about it is to think of benchmarks as being objective, but the choice of benchmark
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.520]   is being subjective. - That's what I mean.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.560]   - And that's the truth of it, right? - It's lies, damn lies, statistics, and benchmarks.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:25.200]   - And everybody has a different weight or different specific benchmark that matters to them. So like,
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.680]   when I'm, I have to review systems like this, and I choose a bunch of things, and I choose,
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.440]   you know, Geekbench, which is a very general gross tool, but it is real in the sense, like,
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.440]   is this faster? Now you want to check that kind of stuff, but, you know, personally,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:46.720]   and I will do this sometimes, I like an isotope D reverb, which is a very specific audio plugin
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.120]   that I use because I do podcasts with people in Echo E rooms. Ah, and I spent hundreds of
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.080]   dollars trying to get the echo out. And, you know, a tool like that, or one of the other
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.720]   isotope audio plugins or a different audio plugin to me is like the number one reason to upgrade
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.800]   my system. And somebody else will have a complete Alex has a different number one reason,
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.320]   and a number two and a number three. And that's the challenge with all of this. And,
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.600]   and it goes to Apple too, where Apple's got its rank. And what it's just trying to do is,
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.200]   right, again, put itself, I had a conversation with an Apple PR person a few years ago,
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.320]   where she straight up said, "Look, my job is to sell. I'm a salesperson." Right? Like PR is not,
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.960]   don't imagine that it's anything but sales. That's what it is. And those, they are going to market
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.320]   the numbers that work best for them. And that's just, that's just how it is.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.960]   I am going to add to that that every YouTube successful YouTube channel is designed to
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:46.800]   attract hits. So much more so than almost now than than even magazines and websites were.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.120]   And so there is also a perverse incentive there. I mean, look at these thumbnails.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.920]   These guys are not just however they play themselves. None of these guys,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:04.560]   none of the big YouTubers are honest actors in the sense that, I mean, they're really,
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:12.160]   in order to succeed, they really have to say stuff that's going to get people upset and
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   interested. And I think LTT is very good. But I think that there is a lot of opportunity to slant
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:24.240]   stuff. Is the primary point of this one that you can get an NVIDIA 4090 and it's going to outperform
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.280]   the Mac? Is that? No, that's not the primary. The primary point is simply that there are claims
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.760]   being made that in the early part of the video, I think he actually even puts it in context of,
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.880]   like this is the sort of thing we would call out a Windows PC maker for or graphics card.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.920]   They're right to do that. I agree. And I do, and I do want to add a personal opinion that
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:52.000]   you are correct that obviously that your, the business of YouTube is to make sure that you
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.360]   build and sustain and grow an audience and that you can monetize that audience.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:01.040]   If you are starting out, you do have to do, I think that that you are, someone is very likely to do
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.280]   very extreme things. There are a couple channels I will not name that keep popping up my recommendations
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:12.480]   where it's always shocked like, Oh, the Vision Pro sets fire to farm with baby ducks and like,
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.560]   okay, you're, you have no credibility and you're squandering what little credibility you have with
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:22.560]   sensationalism. The problem, I think that with Linus Techdix, again, tips, my only, my personal
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.440]   opinion is that they've spent a lot of time doing a lot of hard work. And now they have a reputation.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.080]   So if they were to just simply say, Oh God, I real, Oh God, is this really another Mac? Let's
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.240]   do a hit piece on Mac hit pieces on Mac really play off really, really well. They're going to
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.320]   start to burn off that kind of stuff. And that sort of stuff you don't get back. And also they're,
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.760]   they're, they're being very thorough and they're showing their math. They're not just simply
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:50.000]   offering personal opinions. Thirdly, that there is a difference between a point of view and a bias.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.240]   I think they have a point of view, but they, but I don't think they necessarily have a bias that way.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:59.200]   And I think that it's important to talk about people who it's important to have in the collection
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.960]   of reviews, people who review it on the basis of, I'm not necessarily going to look upon this as
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.280]   this is one of the three Macs that three computers I can possibly buy because I need
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:16.080]   then my next computer to be a Mac as a outfit that games on everything that works and everything that
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.320]   it's video on everything. We are going to create our own benchmarks because if we don't understand
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   what Apple is doing against these numbers, we're going to create actual project workflow so we can
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:28.480]   try to do an apples to apples. We're going to create an Xcode project to try to do an apples to apples
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.840]   project to find out like where these numbers go. So again, I do see the equity and I don't, I don't,
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.680]   I know, while I'm sure that they would choose a title and a thumbnail to get people to click.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.160]   Like if your subscriber gets recommended, once you get into the video itself,
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.000]   I tend to trust what they say. I don't always agree with it, but I tend to respect what they say.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.680]   Well, okay, if the point of your video is don't trust Apple's marketing numbers.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:57.840]   Okay, I think I just said that and I think we've said that all along. I don't think that needs to
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:07.120]   okay, fine. Yeah, this is I feel bad for people who are trying to figure this,
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:15.200]   suss this out because it's hard to find these days objective numbers anywhere. And I think
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:21.920]   YouTubers really have a strong incentive to drive traffic. And that does, you know, as we said,
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.520]   benchmarks can be, you know, the benchmarks and numbers are not lies, but the way you choose
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:34.480]   and use them can mislead. And there's a lot of incentive to do that. And so I'm pretty mistrustful.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:40.080]   I know LTT is good, but I'm very mistrustful of YouTubers and their reviews because there's
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:47.440]   a perverse incentive there. That's all I'm saying. I mean, and I only I could say that because we
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.360]   don't have a perverse incentive because we don't give a goddamn crap if you watch our videos.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:57.120]   Well, I mean, we podcasters tend to be a subscription relationship where you have a long-term
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.200]   relationship. Our relationship is the audience. Exactly. And you know, YouTubers would love to
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.040]   have a subscription relationship, but even the subscription relationship and the notification
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.840]   touch that Bell relationship, YouTube's algorithm overrides all of it. And in the end,
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.320]   they have to make their business that way. It's a tough business to be in. And I think that actually,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.880]   in the grand scheme of things, what you want are YouTubers that play the game, but then drop the
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:24.560]   game as quickly as they can. And so that LTT video, I think is a good example of that where it's
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.040]   kind of probably not the angle that they would take if they weren't trying to get attention. And
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.240]   the thumbnail is what it has to be in order to work in the algorithm. And I would argue the top of
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.840]   the script is a little more inflammatory. And then the further you go in the video, after they've
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.040]   got you, it's perfectly reasonable, right? But that's the game that they have to play. And that's
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.600]   it's that is a tough business to be in knowing some YouTubers. Oh, it's murder. If you don't play
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.280]   the game, you will not make it. Like you have to do it. That's how it is. That's the perforation
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.640]   senate. I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's take a little break. And then we will talk
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.720]   about the fact that Apple has a $3 trillion company doesn't really care what Linus says.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:09.360]   More can take the headphones, Jack's off of everything.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.160]   Yeah, right. We're unstoppable. We're answerable to no one, but God, and we're even putting a
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.880]   buyout offer on God. Our show today brought to you by AG one love my AG one. That's a great way

[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:22.640]   very devoted fans of LTT and I don't want to knock LTT. They do a great job. I just want to say
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:28.000]   consider consider the source right? That's all I respect. It's tough. I mean, I really miss the
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.280]   days when you had I mean a non actually went to work for Apple. They still do I think they still do
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:43.600]   good geeky benchmarking and stuff like that. But it's just hard for any anybody to look at the
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:50.000]   benchmarks and understand what they mean. And as you say, Alex, it's much more than just raw speed
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.080]   that we're or power per watt that we're talking about. It's it's a whole experience.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.720]   I mean, I think that I the thing that I often do because I have again PCs and we have in the
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.520]   office, we have lots of PCs and Linux and and an Apple and I when I'm thinking about my own
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.800]   personal setup, I'm mostly considering my time. Yeah, like how long is I'm taking to do everything
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:17.120]   and and as soon as I add my time and then everything the price points all change because of the amount
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.640]   of time it takes to set up one thing versus another. Yeah, my, you know, at home just for my bono
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:29.040]   fighties. I got a Mac studio on my home desktop Mac studio on the left. I've got an AMD based
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:35.280]   Nvidia based machine on my right, which does not run Windows runs Linux. And I would say I spent
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.800]   more time on the AMD machine these days than I do on the Mac. Of course, I have a Mac laptop.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.920]   This is a Linux in front of me. I'm pretty ecumenical when it comes to operating systems.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.080]   Absolutely. Yeah. As you are, I know, Andy, you carry an Android device, you know,
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.240]   and that's and it's great when being ecumenical, like you say, is great because it really makes
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:02.080]   you appreciate the strengths of a MacBook even more or the strengths of an iPad or an iPhone even
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.120]   more and also makes you appreciate its specific failings. But again, you have specific reasons
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.280]   behind it where you can say, Oh God, there's this feature on Android that I wish I could do on the
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:20.160]   iPhone, but you can't. Well, for instance, if you joined the hot new threads, you would probably
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.360]   be better off doing it on an Android device because you could be in the beta and try new
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:30.080]   features that you cannot try on iOS. There's an example. Are you on? Are you? We don't need to
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.280]   talk about threads. This is a matter show. But you know, it is the hottest thing going right now.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.800]   Yeah, it's supposed like it's it's I mean, no wonder because Facebook is already the largest
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.920]   social media network in the world. And they created this app that doesn't simply say, Oh,
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.640]   thank you. Welcome. We're we're going to try to make you feel at home here. Here's a tour. And if
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.880]   you want to post something, it's like, Hi, welcome to threads. Hey, here's everybody that we thank
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.360]   you. No, click this button to follow all of them. They'll be notified. And hey, here's a thousand
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.120]   people you can invite to have. Well, it's kind of kind of to Jason's point.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:12.400]   When meta when Facebook started, and I guess when YouTube started, we didn't have algorithmic feeds
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.560]   and what these companies have absolutely learned in TikTok is a perfect example.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:22.240]   Twitter didn't have algorithmic feeds in the beginning is if you go to a site and it requires
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.720]   you to figure out who to follow. And and and and you have to do it well to get a good experience.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.680]   That's not the ideal experience. So unlike the way Twitter launched threads launches with the
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.240]   with the TikTok style algorithmic feed. And actually, I liked it at first because I could
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.360]   add the people, Oh, they're there. That's not all that's a good one. Oh, that's good.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:48.880]   And this is to your point exactly, Jason, algorithm is starting to trump relationship.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.240]   But I understand why it's just a lot easier to get started.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:57.760]   Yeah, their argument is that the algorithm once you implement it, engagement goes up. And
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.280]   that's true. Although I think we all know that the road to hell is paved with increasing engagement.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.280]   Right. There is there is a limb. Just talking about that. There's value.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.200]   There's value to both. Right. I think that's the thing that threads right now. They say there will
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.320]   be a non algorithmic version that you can look at too. But it was like, there's value in both and
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.080]   people can find value in both like, you know what the real value is? It's rehabilitated Mark Zuckerberg's
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.840]   reputation. We hated Mark, then along came Elon and said, home, I beer.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:34.080]   Mark Zuckerberg stands still doesn't, you know, don't move. Don't blink. Just stand there and let
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.800]   Elon Musk rocket past you. And there you go. Now suddenly also Instagram, let's talk about just
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.640]   briefly, they laundered this through Instagram. Oh, yeah. Instagram always has felt less awful
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.600]   than Facebook. I know lots of people who despise Facebook who still use Instagram. Because I'm
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.920]   not a say. I'll say, you know, but you're still on Instagram. And the answer is, well, yeah,
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.040]   it's not as bad as Facebook. It's like, it's the same company, but they're right. It is, it does
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.760]   seem to have a different set of of, I don't want to say values regarding Facebook in any way, but
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.480]   a different set of decisions. Instagram has already gone farther down the inshitification trail,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.560]   though, right? Instagram has turned into a nasty ad based, I mean, it used to be every tense
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.800]   post. Now it's like every third post. There's in that. There's a lot of desperation in the,
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.880]   in the ads in there. But anyway, so they wrap threads in Instagram. And I think that they do
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.600]   that in part in order to get the other bad is if they wrapped it in Facebook. You couldn't have
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.920]   an easier on boarding experience as well. Because you just, you know, I mean, it's bad in one
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.880]   respect because you're taking your Instagram handle and, and account with you. But go ahead, Alex.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.720]   Well, I don't know how many people also did what I did, which was I don't want to lose my handle.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.760]   Like that's my whole thing. I have my name. I don't want, I want my hand. So every time there's a new
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   social media thing, I jump on, I establish my handle. And then with threads, I jumped on, I
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.800]   make sure I had my handle. I played with it a little bit. And then I deleted off my phone because I
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.480]   like my battery. And so, so I was just like, you know, like, I don't have any meta tools on my phone.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.640]   I still use them on the web here and there, but I don't put them on my phone because my battery
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.960]   lasts so long now. Like it's like, you know, and it, it was, it was, I don't care what anyone says,
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.080]   like when I take the meta apps off, my battery lasts longer. I don't have any paranoia about it.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.480]   I don't have any, you know, there's not no upset. I just like my battery to last, you know, and
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.320]   whatever they're doing, they're a lot of battery. So threads is 17% of my battery.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.720]   All of your battery uses. Yeah, for an app. The Ford app to get into my cars, 11%, TikToks, 10%.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:44.240]   Right. Yeah. So between those three, a third of my battery is used by those three apps.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.360]   I was feeling pretty good about itself right now.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:55.120]   That is though the real Phil Shiller on threads. I don't know if Apple's created an account yet.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.520]   What was interesting about threads is how many brands, how many news brands and
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.080]   consumer brands immediately jumped on. Like they were happy to get on.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.600]   Everyone's everyone's like, they want to get off Twitter, but it feels a little like jumping
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.960]   out of the off the pan and into the fire. Well, that'll be interesting.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:21.520]   George between two, Schiller deleted his Instagram account. And so he must have recreated it.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:28.080]   He also new to his Twitter accounts, but he is Phil Shiller 007.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:37.680]   And by the way, happy birthday to the App Store, 15th birthday today. And iOS today did
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.960]   devote their entire show to the celebration. Let me group had a nice blog post about being like,
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.920]   I think of either one of the very, very, very first apps on the App Store, but also like the first
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:53.440]   like number one top amazing seller when they had the iPhone version of Omni Focus on it.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.080]   And no wonder they are they are a marvel of Mac and iOS development.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.800]   We were not here on the 4th of July. I hope you all in the US had a good
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.760]   celebration and I'm sorry to the fingers check everybody.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.320]   Thank you, sir.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.920]   10 for everybody.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.320]   10 of them.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:08.640]   10 of them.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.120]   Alex, you seem like growing up, you might have blown things up at the cornfield.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.880]   I don't know. I'm just thinking, you know, when you're a whole story about that.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.280]   Anyway, so.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.520]   He doesn't want to tell it though, does he?
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.640]   No, my when I was 18 years old, my my, I'll tell a story. I guess I can tell the story now.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:33.840]   When I was 18 years old, my father was a federal prosecutor and I was, you know, I live in the
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:40.400]   country. And so, um, uh, FBI agent took me out from my birthday when I was 18 years old.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.800]   He just said, my present for you today is the rum reminds you that when you're under 18,
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.400]   you're blowing stuff up, you're precocious. And when you're over 18, you're a felon.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.560]   And he goes, and we have a file on you about this thing.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.600]   And he goes, he goes, anything that goes boom within 50 miles of your house.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.800]   You show up on the short list.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.320]   You are the usual suspect.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:02.720]   Yes.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.160]   What a, what a scallow.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.680]   What was it that I've had no experience since then. But before that, I will say that I was
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.040]   precocious. You know, um, I have a dear friend who grew up in the cornfields of Nebraska and, uh,
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.240]   they actually had stadium seating. They built stands out in the cornfield
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:26.160]   for the for the July. And they would have quite a, they, uh, I think it was his uncle,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.080]   a three finger Fred who was the ring master.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.840]   My, my uncle saw me going down that path and he just said, I only have this advice.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.520]   He goes, no metal, no glass.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.880]   Yeah. And that was it.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.680]   I burn myself a lot. I still don't grow hair on parts of my legs, but, um, but, uh, but anyway,
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:49.760]   yeah, I, I, my shins, my shins are perfectly smooth from a, from a blast that was a little too close.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.120]   Don't worry.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:51.760]   Let's do it.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.360]   There's a, there's a kind of fun with computers that I stopped engaging in,
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.080]   like around eight year or 19, because I had, I didn't have the talk.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.880]   I had that revelation that, oh, I'm not a precocious teenager who's simply
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:08.560]   exploring with computers. I'm an adult who is possibly, yeah, exactly.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.760]   Maybe I should just go into programming and so of exploration.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.000]   It was really a Henry the fifth moment for me.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.080]   I had to give up Paul's staff and this was sliding, sliding doors.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.040]   There's, there's a version of Alex that's in a cabinet, a wood on pay on paid 70,000 of his
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:28.560]   manifesto. So there were a few stories from last week we didn't get to talk about,
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.520]   but I'll bring up a couple of them. Uh, one, uh, goldman is looking for a way out of its
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.760]   partnership with apple there. We had talked a couple of months ago about the fact that they
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:44.240]   lost a billion dollars on a consumer finance. And that's primarily, I would guess the apple card.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:48.000]   They're talking with the American Express, at least it, but they were last week,
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.920]   according to the Wall Street Journal, to take over, uh, all of the consumer stuff, except for
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:00.160]   their high interest rate savings account, Marcus, but they would like to retreat from apple and
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:07.920]   credit cards entirely. Uh, it's not necessarily a slam against apple about, oh, it's a bad deal,
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.160]   or this is a, this is financially untenable. It is like they made a really big gamble and just
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:16.480]   saying we are a financial investment bank and a financial services company. We want to become a
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   consumer bank and we wanted to issue credit cards. We want to have saving savings accounts. They
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.440]   made a lot of investments and a lot of purchases and acquisitions based on that in the past three,
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.320]   four years, and they just, the bill came due and they're like, okay, we're out. This is not,
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.880]   we don't have a plan for turning this around. And so therefore it's best that we just simply fold.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.400]   And I don't think they, they have, they don't necessarily have a mechanism for it. Like, I think
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.360]   the thing is that to do this consumer business, the consumer business is hard everywhere.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.440]   Every time you start to saying, I want to sell to an average person who's going to be measuring
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:54.160]   things in single dollar units or $10 units, you have to be, you have to be extremely efficient,
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.480]   you know, to make that actually turn out, you know, when you deal with businesses, when you deal
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:03.680]   with large investments, there's a lot of while on flutter that can protect you, but so many small
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.640]   transactions are super, super hard to do efficiently and the companies that do it well, do it well
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.240]   and the company trying to get into it, I think they found a little bit harder. I think it was good
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.400]   for Apple because Apple has figured out a lot of things and we can see Apple at it continuing
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.160]   to add features. I think they also may be looking at, we're going to put all this investment in
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.480]   and eventually Apple's going to pull it in house and then we're not going to ever turn a corner.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:29.440]   You know, like, you know, like there, you know, that Apple's in this process right now, it seems
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.480]   to be building out all the other things that you would need to be a bank.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.400]   So, so, you know, Goldman was the Motorola or the Intel of
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:41.680]   its bank. Oh, God. At some point, they're going through Apple banking. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.000]   Or the, what was the, what was it? What was the phone company before it became AT&T?
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.240]   AT&T? Yeah, but it wasn't AT&T. Singular. Singular. They're the singular.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.800]   Did you see Blackberry? Yes. What a great movie. What a so good fun. That'd be not a great movie,
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.720]   but a lot of fun. Really fun. I thought it was good movie. I thought it was fun. I mean,
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:07.040]   it really was a lesson. A lot. And so many things. The story of the rise and fall of the Blackberry,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:13.280]   you know, research and most of my motion. And they meet with, they meet with singular in AT&T. Yeah.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.760]   Trying to sell them the Blackberry. And really was, you know, you, they showed the iPhone just
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:23.600]   killing it dead. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it was smart. One of the three founders.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.920]   The one that was crazy. The crazy guy. The crazy guy with the headband, the hippie.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:35.040]   He soon as the iPhone came out, he sold his, he sold his rims stock. And he's a billionaire.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.920]   Yeah. They said he's quietly one of the richest people in the world. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:45.840]   It's hysterical. It's hysterical. Let's see. Oh, let's, there's a lot of rumors. We guess we should
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:52.080]   probably cover these. Apple, according to Mark Gurman is going to have to, well, first of all,
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.160]   it's going to launch in stores and you're going to have to make an appointment to buy one.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.520]   Apple plans. This is from a Gurman, a slow appointment only rollout of its vision pro.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:12.240]   You will have to get measured. You will have to go in and give them your eye prescription.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.760]   There's going to be a lot. They are not going to sell it, you know,
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.200]   it sounds like they're not going to sell it online.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:31.600]   Gurman also says Apple's cheaper model will not be out next year, will not be out in 25,
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:38.800]   will be out in 2026. So this is a long runway for this jet to take off.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.840]   We all knew that. And I think that it makes a perfect sense that they're going to have,
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.920]   when they sell these, the first vision pro, it's going to have to be a concierge process.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.080]   Because one of the one, the hallmarks of Apple through every generation has been,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.560]   we want the consumer to have the best experience possible. If we see a nail sticking up that they
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:02.080]   might catch on or step on, we're going to hammer that thing down. And there are so many opportunities
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.480]   for someone to sign for a box off of FedEx, try to get this thing working, not have a great experience
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.280]   because they didn't get the right, they didn't get the right eye interface, they didn't get the
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:18.240]   right eye glasses things, they didn't get the first, they didn't get the great first 30-minute
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.720]   demo walking them through. Like here is what we're doing. Hey, look, I'm also in the space with you
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.400]   because I'm also wearing this and I can show you how you can actually activate things.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.840]   They need to make sure that the people who spend 3,500 bucks for this and then blog about it or
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.520]   make YouTube videos about it. Or even just people who are just excited consumers don't simply say
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.880]   that, oh, wow, I could have just gotten a quest. This doesn't work anything, anything better than
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.240]   anything else. And this is not a move that you make if you're going to sell tens of millions of
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.520]   something, but it's a move you can afford to make and in fact maybe even want to make when
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.160]   your resource constrain, you can only sell a few hundred thousand of them total. So you limit,
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.560]   you make an appointment, you limit the regions and the stores that might even offer them.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.000]   I don't think Gerbins reports says they're not going to sell them online,
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.400]   but and they were acting at WWDC like they were going to sell them online too. But like in-store,
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:20.160]   they're gearing up for this very complex, concierge style process. And I think that's why is because
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:26.480]   they can afford to and it actually kind of helps gate the availability. And I think that's important
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.040]   because they don't have very many. They won't have very many.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.480]   And it's when you got glass, they fitted you. I had to go into the Google
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.800]   office, the glass office in San Francisco and they did the whole setup and put everything together.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.520]   So it's not an unusual thing to do actually.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:51.840]   Right. And this also from the Financial Times, citing unidentified people close to Apple and
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:58.320]   Luxshare, which is the Chinese firm that's assembling the device. Luxshare said Apple was only asking
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:07.280]   for enough parts for 130,000 to 150,000 units in the first year. The Financial Times says Apple
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.360]   is preparing to make fewer than 400,000 units in 2024. So they had originally planned a million.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.960]   So yeah, another reason why they're not in a hurry to sell them to you. They don't have that.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.720]   That doesn't scare me at all. I don't think that should scare anybody at all.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:29.200]   I think that it makes me interested in how they're going to sell. If they have limited numbers and
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.320]   they are reasonably sure there's more demand than supply, how are they going to choose to allocate
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.760]   these and make sure that look, we're going to have a there's a percentage that we're only going to
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.680]   be able to sell. We're going to only going to sell through developer channels so that you have
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.960]   they're going to make sure that there are people who are not just buying it, doing a video or
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.200]   having fun with it on the yacht on 4th of July weekend and then putting a box and never using it
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:56.960]   again. Each one of these is an investment for Apple in future experiences and future developers.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.800]   And so if they only have a couple hundred thousand to sell, which is peanuts, particularly
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.360]   when you think about the volumes in which Apple usually transacts hardware, it seems as though
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.800]   there it would be who have them to make sure that it goes into the hands of people who can do the
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.200]   most good for Apple. I think they're going to prioritize it based on the people at 5 a.m.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.200]   that are sitting there going to be fresh, refresh, refresh, refresh. I think that's going to be the
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.480]   maybe because there's a whole bunch of people are going to sit there just grabbing onto it, trying
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   to get ahold of it. Or maybe they'll be like Ferrari, or it's going to be like, well, we can't
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:31.920]   sell you an F1 unless you also unless in the past three years you've bought this car, this car,
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.400]   and this car. I mean, that's how they're going to sell all those Mac bros now.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.880]   It's like, well, we only want our most valued customers. So
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:48.480]   no rumor that that's going to happen. There is a rumor that the Apple's working on a
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.840]   car, according to German, larger than 30 inch iMac, but don't expect it until late next year.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:30:00.720]   It's more than a year out. I think some people will be disappointed by that. I think most of us have
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:06.240]   just grown accustomed to the idea that we'd buy a Mac studio or a Mac mini and a nice screen and
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:14.480]   be done with it. I think my question about this product rumor is who wants an iMac that's that big
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:20.800]   and doesn't just want to buy an external display. What is the market for that? I'll tell you,
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.480]   because I don't know, but I'm not going to tell you the answer. I'm going to ask another question
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.240]   here. When I have talked to Apple people in the past about the iMac, what they've always said is
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:39.760]   you've got to understand the iMac sells, it's the most popular desktop Apple sells, and they sell a
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:46.080]   lot of them. It's actually pretty big business, and they go to weird places. Some of them go to
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:52.720]   schools, a lot of them go to like reception areas and in hotels. It's a piece of furniture.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:58.000]   Some people park one in their house, even if they've got laptops because it gives a general
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.120]   purpose computer in their house. The impression I get is that Apple sells more iMacs than you'd
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:11.040]   think. They're used in a really wide variety of ways, more than many of us computer expert type
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.560]   people think of, and who would know better than Apple? How many they sell and where they go and
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:22.560]   all of that. When I see a rumor like this, and I'm a little bit baffled about why, and I like a big
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:28.080]   iMac, I have a 27-inch iMac for years, but now that they've got the external display thing going
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.880]   on with little Apple Silicon computers to drive it seems much more efficient that way, I've got
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   to believe that Apple would not be even talking about making this product if they didn't think
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:47.280]   they could sell a bunch of them to somewhere. I just am not sure where that is. The 24 fits,
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:54.400]   I mean it literally physically fits in a lot of spaces that the 32 does not, but obviously,
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.560]   like I'm not going to question this, like if it is gone to the point where it's in development,
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.160]   Apple seems to be convinced that they know that there's an audience for it, otherwise they wouldn't
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:08.160]   do it. Yeah, I'll quiz quickly, I'm with you. It's like, if I had heard that rumor from a less
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.920]   reliable source, I'd say, "Okay, well a lot of people have lots of ideas about what Apple's going
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.400]   to be doing," but it's a really good source. And the first thing I thought was just like what you
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:22.560]   thought was that, "Okay, obviously Apple has access to better sales numbers than I do. Maybe they're
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:29.600]   aware of a certain region of the globe in which these big, all-in-ones are much, much more relevant
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:35.120]   product than like you say a really nice iMac and a really nice display because I don't get it."
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:41.200]   One of the reasons Apple sold the iMac towards the end was in order to drive a 5K display,
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:47.280]   they had to have special circuitry, special hardware, 5K was a breach. That's not the case
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:54.240]   anymore, right? Yeah, it was their apology for the Quaker Woods box, some Lendrachol Mac Pro.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:00.240]   How quickly can we get a high performance Intel super, super cool machine in the hands of
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:05.920]   developers who are now muting? Yeah, I wanted to ask Alex about this picture, Leek on
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:12.560]   Twitter from David Altizer. Rumor, Apple has been shooting all their Apple TV+ shows
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:20.560]   in 180 degree virtual reality. He's using this as the evidence, a leaked photo of a 180 camera
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:26.480]   rig set on set. First of all, Alex, do you recognize this camera and second is the
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:32.640]   screen? I recognize the warehouse. Oh, so, so, okay. So, anyway, that's PRG.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:37.680]   That's not on a set. So, that's a, that's the PRG.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:43.520]   This is a rental rear. Well, it's a big event/rental house PRG and those are big
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.840]   warehouse. Those are all those road cases that'll get loaded into something. So, I don't think
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.240]   that this is shot from a set. I think that they might have sold it as that, but that's not,
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.800]   that's not a set. That's a PRG's like supply house. They have a bunch of them. They're big.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:05.840]   The, what that looks like is the, it looks like the Canon R-series dual 180 lens on,
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:11.040]   and it's most likely attached to a Raptor. So, the red Raptors, the two big cameras that
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:18.400]   people are testing right now with those are the R5C and the Raptors. And then you have the dual
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.120]   lenses that you, both of them are, you know, mounted, mounted there. So, so those are the,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.640]   those are the ones that people are playing with. Obviously, the Raptor gives you a
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:31.280]   greater dynamic range. If you were going to shoot something that was at Apple's level,
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.040]   you'd probably end up using the Raptor. If you wanted to experiment, you'd probably use the Canon
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:41.440]   R5C. I don't have any doubt that Apple is shooting some content with that setup. Like,
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.920]   I think that they are absolutely, and by the way, the reason that dual, that's one lens,
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.640]   it takes those two, it puts both of those images onto, on the sensor together,
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:55.280]   and that means they stay synced and it's a lot easier to process. It has to be a full-frame sensor
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.760]   and it's an 8K sensor, and that, that means that you have the left, right, you know, that,
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.080]   that are there all in the same sensor. Otherwise, you have to build a much more complex rig, which
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.600]   have become very valuable in our market. You mentioned that, yeah.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.520]   Yeah. So, they, so the, so anyway, so those, but it's much, much easier to, to develop with these
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.680]   two. What I think is most likely happening is that Apple is probably shooting scenes or pieces of
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:26.080]   scenes or behind the scenes of shows with that rig, and I wouldn't, I'd be blown away if they
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.160]   didn't. I would do that. I would shoot little scenes to show you what that looks like, or I would
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:34.480]   shoot the behind the scenes so you can see what it looked like. I'd be shooting MLS with it,
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.480]   I'd be doing, you know, so there's, there's so many places.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.920]   Experimenting though. Not shooting all your content that way.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.560]   It's so hard. Like, so here's the problem with, even with, with 360, it's really, really hard.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.360]   We did a lot of 360, but with 180, it's still hard. Remember that when you're shooting a film,
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.960]   there's a lot of stuff happening right outside of frame. There's flags, there's,
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:58.320]   you've got flags, you've got boom mics, you've got rigging, you've got all these other things
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.960]   that are happening, and usually they're either right outside the frame or sometimes garbage
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.840]   mapped or rotoed because they were in the frame. You know, 180 lens, you get to see all of that.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.040]   And so, so it's much less now you could clean a set or do something for certain shots
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:20.640]   that you get that 180, but I think that now as a, as your extra day, extra content,
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.040]   the behind the scenes stuff. So you great, you get your mission impossible stuff,
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.120]   and you get some behind the scenes shots of it. Wow, that's going to be great.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.760]   Kids going to be so cool to stay in there and see in 3D and be able to sit there as,
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:39.440]   as if you were watching it looking back and forth. And, and, you know, I think that the, and we're
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:45.280]   hearing that, that they're asking for, you know, 120 frames a second from a lot of folks. And so,
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.640]   so, you know, the 8K 120 is, you know, kind of the still the mark that Apple's kind of looking for,
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:55.680]   which is still higher. I still think the next version of the pro headset is going to be 120
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.480]   frames a second. I think that the 90, what we see in the first form factor is going to be what
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.400]   the normal headset is that's less expensive two years from now. The pro will go, I think, up to
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.320]   8K 120, you know, as far as the delivery method. And so, so I think that that's probably where we're
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.680]   anyway. So I think that it's, it would be crazy for them not to be shooting that kind of content,
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.560]   but I don't think that they're shooting like whole shows in it. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:25.360]   Yeah. It's, it's, it's so telling that even the biggest budget Hollywood movies,
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:32.720]   they shoot in 2D and then do a 3D conversion because shooting in, they just, and Alex has
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:41.920]   talked about this on previous shows, shooting in 3D is very difficult. And generally, they don't
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.000]   bother. They just don't bother. Well, and it, and it's what ruined their industry, you know, like,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.120]   like the 3D when Avatar came out, we were like, wow, I could watch a lot of things this way.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   And then everyone came in and cheated. And what you ended up with is something like,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.560]   eh, it's okay. I don't think I want to pay for that. Oh, it doesn't look as good, right? Like,
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.240]   you can tell when you watch something in Bloodshot and 3D, it looks beautiful.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:08.240]   Yeah. But it also caught like people, the impression I get other than James Cameron is people
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.640]   do it once and then they're like, Oh, I'm never doing that again.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.480]   You know, he has a very, my sister says he made just one 3D movie, even, but it was a magnificent
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.960]   movie, which the best. And it was, it was with three, you think that, Oh, wow, he's playing with
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.840]   3D is like, no, 3D is absolutely essential to the progression of the story he's telling. But you
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.320]   have very few filmmakers who are using 3D the way the camera does and the way the score says.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:38.800]   This is the IMAX 3D camera. And it's, it's a, it's a big sucker. It is not a beast. Yeah, you're
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.200]   not going to, I mean, you could take it up on Everest, I guess, but I saw a viral video the
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.000]   other day, because people are talking about IMAX a lot because we've got the whole mission
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.160]   impossible versus pop a timer. I saw a video that was great because it was from the set of a
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:57.120]   scene being shot in an IMAX camera. And the thing that you don't realize unless you've been on one
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.640]   of those sets is that the IMAX camera, in addition to being huge and only being able to shoot for a
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:08.560]   very short amount of time, sounds like a chainsaw. So literally, it's amazing. People are
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.280]   walking down a street and there's an IMAX shot and the chainsaw is going. And they'll hike, well,
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   if you ever asked yourself, are we going to have to loop every little bit of dialogue in this entire
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:22.560]   movie? The answer is yes. It's like the old days of Hollywood, Hollywood changed completely when they
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:28.480]   had quiet portable cameras. This is like going back to those old studio cameras. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.440]   Yeah. And, and, and the, you know, the 3D stuff is kind of the fortunate thing for people who are
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.760]   doing stuff for vision or anything else is that we did go through this huge sprint where there was
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.840]   a bunch of technology that was built for it, the controllers and lots of things were figured out,
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:48.480]   you know, back, you know, 10 years ago or whatever. But, you know, it's still, you know, I do think that
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.480]   when people see 8K 120, you know, you know, it's going to be something that
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.080]   it's going to make a difference. And, and what it's so cheap, I mean, it's much cheaper to shoot
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:04.480]   behind the scenes or shoot certain scenes when you're already doing production, you know, and,
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.840]   and add that in because you own the production. The hardest part is negotiating all about
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.200]   180 and all the extra shooting with a production company that is, you know, going to go out for
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.640]   features because Apple is building their own content. They have a lot more because they can say,
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.680]   hey, we would like to do this. We're not asking. I think I really, I want to go see Oppenheimer
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.440]   in an IMAX cinema. Although AMC, you'd be interested to hear because people are worried,
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:33.040]   how do I choose Barbie Oppenheimer? Barbie Oppenheimer. AMC is selling double bill
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:39.040]   Barbenheimer tickets. And they've heard really a crossover between Barbie and
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:45.600]   Alperlin. Well, I would say, you know, the wife might want to see Barbie and the husband
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:51.120]   might want to see. I think I think I think that's why you take someone out to ice cream after,
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:56.560]   like you tell them that your that their dog died. So I do see wisdom of, hey, let's go see a pink
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:01.360]   Barbie movie after seeing how the entire planet is now. I just love the devil. I just love the,
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.080]   I just love them, them, them, grappling with the non zero chance that when we set this off,
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:14.400]   it might not stop. That's one of the great, Matt, when you know that Matt Damon is playing,
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:19.120]   is playing like the, the, the, the Colonel, you give him a line like, well, it's, it's the,
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.080]   it's the non, well, what kind of chance of what you like? Ideally zero.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:29.440]   And the world. Well, and the, the, you know, I, what's interesting though, is the other pressure
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.960]   really is looking at mission impossible. If you want to see mission impossible in IMAX,
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.240]   you have to see it this week because it only got a one week window in IMAX because the commitment
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.840]   to Oppenheimer happened a long time ago, a long time before mission impossible was scheduled. So
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.800]   measure, I think Mr. Possen got scheduled or paramount and they were like, Hey, what's the,
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.520]   what the one week they're like, came in too late. You were, you're too late for that. And so, um, uh,
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.880]   so yeah, I would, I would definitely see Oppenheimer in a big screen. You also, you don't, you don't say
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:03.680]   no to, uh, you don't, you don't say no to McCory slash crews in IMAX. It's like, they are people who
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.560]   absolutely love movies, not just, Hey, we're gonna have a nice window before we put this out to
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:14.080]   screaming. It's like, no, we are going to sell damn popcorn. Popcorn, popcorn, popcorn to people.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.600]   Oppenheimer, I think is a hundred day window. Like it's got a, it's, it's a, it's a really,
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.160]   really long window. Um, and again, when something, when they say something shot for IMAX, I think
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.240]   it's a lot more fun to go watch it. Cause it really takes it. I don't know if it's really
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.960]   worth the oftentimes seeing stuff that isn't shot for IMAX. Right. And then I'm, is Oppenheimer
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:36.720]   shot for IMAX? Yeah. Okay. Shout out with the camera. Did they shoot the whole thing or? I,
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:41.920]   I remember when I saw the dark night, I think it was like, put your glasses on and I'm
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.800]   asked. Put your glasses on. Okay. Now take your glasses off. Okay. Now take your glasses off.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   That was not fun. I did not. I, I, yeah. I think that, uh, I think that they shot the whole thing
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.040]   for IMAX. I'm not, I'm not a hundred percent certain, but I, I'm pretty sure that it's almost all
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:02.080]   because again with, uh, no, no, nuclear, nuclear blast. You want an IMAX, right? Yeah.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.720]   I hope that, I hope that's one of the reviewers, like actually does the math and figures out like how
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:12.400]   watching Oppenheimer and IMAX is the equivalent of having how many chest X rays in one day.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:19.280]   Christopher Nolan says like Dunkirk and Tenet Oppenheimer is filmed entirely on large format film stock,
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:26.080]   meaning a combination of IMAX 65 millimeter and Panavision 65 millimeter that's then projected in 70.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.480]   And the interesting thing for Oppenheimer is I believe that they developed a new, uh,
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:35.680]   black and white film just for the film. Just just for this, for this piece because they didn't want to
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.560]   color, they didn't want to just do mono of the color film stock. So they, they actually got
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:47.360]   their own film stock of black and white to do it. So it's a, I mean, Nolan is pushing the out,
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:53.840]   like he, he, he and Cameron and a couple others have the juice to say, I'm going to make a film
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.160]   exactly the way I'd like to make a film and you will all figure it out. You know, and there's not
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:04.160]   that many directors left that can do that. Here's a picture of, uh, Nolan attacking Cillian Murphy,
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.920]   the star with an IMAX camera. So, he said, this picture of the sound of the buzz saw.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:15.040]   There's some behind the scenes of that. You see it. It's, it's, that we're going to lock this down
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.600]   and we and the rest of the crew are going behind this lead-lined wall. Yeah. Well, we turn on the
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.480]   camera. There's the, uh, there's the 65 millimeter film stock. Look at the size of that. Wow.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.680]   There are directors who are making events and there are directors who are making movies. These
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:36.160]   people are making movies. Yeah, I'll just wait and watch it on my iPhone. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.440]   You know, but that's, I haven't been to a theater, right? I haven't been to a theater in three,
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.120]   more than three years. That's what it's going to take to get me out into the theater.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:48.640]   Yeah. So, I'm going to go out. It's the only time I go out. That was the, that was the,
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.640]   the first movie theater I've been in since like 2019. Yeah. Was it worth it?
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:57.680]   Yes. I thought it was, I thought it was terrific. Not a perfect movie. What Barbie? I'm lit. Bunch.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.720]   Indiana Jones. Oh, Indiana Jones. Okay. Fun movie. Again, it was that one, another one where it was
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:08.400]   a movie, not an event. Also very happy to see the Spider-Verse sequel in the theater. I've seen both
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:13.200]   of those movies in the theater. And it's like, it is funny how we've sort of recalibrated to being,
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:19.360]   do I really want to see this on a big screen? And, and that's the funny thing about Oppenheimer.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:24.000]   And really the mission impossible is that they're probably best viewed on a big screen. So I regret,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.960]   I like, I saw Top, the Top Gun sequel. And it was like, the script is terrible, but it's kind of
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.480]   exciting. And I get the impression that if I had seen it really loud on a giant screen, I would
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.120]   have been like, oh, please. Yeah. And that would have been better. I was holding out for better
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.960]   seats. And I just didn't get to see Maverick on it. And at home, it's really great. But I know that,
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:47.040]   I mean, talking to my friends who saw it on an iMacs, they were just like, oh, it was truly
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.280]   something to see. So yeah, I'll get back to Apple though. One thing I wanted to ask you, like,
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.720]   when do you think is going to be the first Apple keynote that has special content for vision pro
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:03.200]   users or like a soundcast? Oh, that is, oh, I think it'll be next year. That would give you
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:06.480]   no what? That's the first thing I've heard that would make me want to buy a vision, bro.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.560]   Well, I just think that I think that the Apple needs to, they're going to want to prove that model,
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.320]   you know, and I think that there's it's much easier when it's not live, you know, so,
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.800]   so the fact that they can do the whole thing and shoot it that way, I think that it would make
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.200]   sense to do it sometime next year. I don't have any, you know, it when it's doing, when you're
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:28.080]   doing it in post, it should be relatively straightforward to do that. I don't think we've
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.120]   now, I'm sorry. The one thing I'll say is that they don't, it's not very hard because they're
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:35.280]   probably not going to, they're probably going to put it on a screen. So, you know, when you think
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.200]   about, they're going to put it in a window that sits inside of a space. So the space will most
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.000]   likely be the theater and the window will be there. Now they can make that window 3D if they want,
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.240]   you know, so they can shoot it in 3D. So it pops out. I'd be surprised. So I think that they
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:52.080]   would deliver it that way. The problem really is the way that they do the, you have to figure
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.960]   out how they do it. And they could theoretically do it this way, which is that there's a lot of
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.960]   things that they do in the keynote now, now that it's not on stage, that would be hard to do
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:06.320]   it'd be hard for someone to watch because, so when you put, when you create the space
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.120]   that the video is sitting in, so if you use the, you know, of course, in the vision, there's the
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:15.680]   windows, there's volumes and there's spaces. The windows is what you would typically play a
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.640]   movie inside of. The space is the environment, but it's the one, it's the 360/180 environment.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.680]   When you put that in there and you start cutting cameras really fast, or you start doing big
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:32.000]   jib shots or moves and all the crig shots, or those big moves where they move from one
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.080]   floor to another, a lot of people that will get sick. It's making me nauseous. Just thinking about
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.000]   it. So everyone's stomach will pull up into their, you know, into their, into their, into their
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000]   throat as, as that moves down there. Maybe they want to do that. But I think that the other thing
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.440]   that they could do is they could recreate quote unquote a stage experience where they're
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:55.760]   gently going so that the, the vision version is much different. It doesn't have as many moves.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.880]   It's more like sitting on a stage and it's going to deliver you, and you can still change scenes
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:07.120]   in it, but it may, they, I think eventually they could get to that. So there's going to be,
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:13.600]   I mean, developing the 180 content for this is going to be pretty, I think, pretty exciting. So
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:18.000]   we'll see how far they push it, but I think most likely they would do a 3D version inside of a
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.120]   window at first. Maybe even shifting, you know, you can shift back and forth. So you, I think this
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.360]   is where we're going to see MLS, where you're going to see, you're going to be watching it in a
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:34.320]   16 by nine window, then they score and the window disappears and you're suddenly getting a replay
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.760]   in stereo or, you know, like in 180, like you're there on the, or they just every once in a while
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.560]   take you to a certain part of the field and let you experience that in, you know, full 180. I
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.480]   think that's going to be really interesting. Jason Snell just dropping this in our club
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.800]   with Discord. The new Apple developer betas have just dropped.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.760]   Yeah. And in new, I'm going to put that in quotation marks because these are still beta 3,
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.800]   but they're incremented build numbers. Now why would they do that? Why would they possibly do
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.920]   that? Well, one reason is this is about the time every year where the public beta comes out.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:16.000]   And I wonder if perhaps they had to make a few adjustments to beta 3 to fix some things before
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.240]   they unleash it on the public. So keep an eye out. They only said July, so it could be at any
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.440]   point between now and the end of the month. But this would, like if you're looking for public betas,
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:34.960]   this I think is a smoke signal that they're probably on the way soon because Apple likes to run.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:39.200]   Here's how it works. Apple likes to run the developer beta by the people in that group
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:46.320]   to find showstoppers. And they did that today. So you would think it would be imminent
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.160]   if there weren't showstoppers. So if you're a developer on the betas update now, and if you're
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:58.080]   not, or you're listening to this in the next week, maybe the public betas are even out by then,
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.240]   it really there's no way to tell until Apple. They sometimes will go right up to the moment
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:07.920]   and then be like, forget it, not today, not today. Got a problem. But this is super suspicious that
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:14.400]   it's not beta four. It's just beta three, incremented like a couple, like the Mac one went from like
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:20.720]   G to I, right? Like in the internal build system, they didn't even increment the number. It's very
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.840]   clearly just a slightly more recent build than that. But that'll make a public. I mean, there are
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.840]   more people on the public beta. It's easier to get into the dev beta than it used to be. But the
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:36.240]   public betas are very popular these days. And I think we maybe are very close now.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.880]   You've been using the developer betas. Would you? Yeah. Presuming that these will come out before
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.520]   next Mac break weekly. Would you warn people away from the public betas or?
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:53.360]   I'd say it's the standard warning. Like you should be prepared. Like, if it's something that you rely
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:57.760]   on to get your day to day work done, you should probably not do it. If it's something that you
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:01.840]   want to do for fun to get a preview, or you're willing to suffer, maybe worse battery life.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.080]   It's if it's a mobile device, maybe some apps that don't behave quite right, but you're willing to
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:13.280]   chance it. Like, I haven't had any big problems at all with any of them. But, you know, there's also
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.760]   on the Mac, there's software that I rely on that does not work on the public beta. And so I have to
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:23.520]   have a second system so that I can run that software anyway. So, you know, you just got to be careful.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:29.840]   But these days, my beta warnings are a lot less than they used to be. Because Apple has this whole
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:35.840]   public beta process. Apple is trying very hard not to ruin everybody's summer. And so it's not
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:39.680]   quite as dangerous as it used to be. Also point out if you're a Mac user, unlike the iPad and the
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:45.760]   iPhone, a Mac user, you can install the OS on an external drive and then reboot into the old
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:51.040]   operating system, which is nice and safe. You can't do that on the iPad and the iPhone. So you're
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.240]   just going to have to risk it. But that all said, I have not had any real problems with it. And some
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:00.960]   of the features are fun. So if you're willing to take the risk, but like, if like literally you're
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:06.160]   going to lose your job, if this app doesn't work, do not do it. Just don't risk it. Don't risk it.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:12.800]   There's a lot of interest in iOS 17. And as a, as the only Mac podcast in Sonoma County,
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:19.280]   I think we probably should adapt that. It's going to be a good year for Sonoma County, right?
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:24.080]   Like this is the year. We got we got I don't know what happened in Ventura County, but I hear it was
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:30.720]   big. We're expecting good things. All right, your breaks, your picks rather,
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:37.600]   the week coming up after a break. So prepare those boys. I do want to give a little plug to
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:44.080]   club tick because we've got some great events coming up in our discord on Friday. The inside
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:50.080]   Twitter after hours, the alcohol fueled inside Twitter and pro at our community manager,
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:57.520]   host, not alcohol. Okay, it's gonna be alcohol. Yeah, it's alcohol fueled. It's funny cars and
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:03.760]   kerosene and jet fuel and John's shaking. John's learning is shaking his head. John Ashley says,
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.960]   yes, John's learning it says no. Okay, well, we'll find out you should tune in 5 p.m. Pacific
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:15.520]   Friday, July 14th, the following a couple weeks later, a fireside chat with Ron Pyle. I'm really
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:21.680]   glad to see that ants going to do what he calls coffee time live photo critiques in the club.
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:28.640]   That starts August 4th, 4 p.m. The club is the place to be these days. It's inexpensive. It's
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:34.240]   $7 a month. And you get ad free versions of this show and every public show we do actually,
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:40.880]   every show we do, you get access to shows that we don't do in public. The new AI show with Jason
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.680]   Helen Jeff Jarvis will launch in the club first. That's how we did it with this week in space with
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:51.200]   Rod Pyle. And then it went public after we built a large enough audience home theater geeks with
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.760]   Scott Wilkinson, Michael Sargent's hands on Mac, hands on windows with Paul throughout the
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:01.040]   untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett and company that gives his with Dick D Bartolo. These
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.040]   are all shows that are in the club only somebody was asking, email me said, we're I've been looking
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.160]   everywhere for the Hugh Howie interview that the amp Pruitt did a couple of weeks ago. Where is it?
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.840]   It's in the club and the Twit Plus feed. So I think we give you a lot of value. And I have to say,
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.480]   it's also really important to our financial future because podcast and struggling just a little bit
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.240]   these days. And we've already had to cancel a couple of shows. I don't want to cancel any more
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:32.800]   shows. And I definitely don't want to, you know, turn off the lights. So if you want to keep the
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:41.360]   lights on, keep the shows going, twit.tv/clubtwit. And I thank you in advance. We love our club
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:46.800]   members. And they make a lot of things possible that we wouldn't be doing otherwise. As do our

[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:46.720]   ZipRecruiter. The smartest way to hire. Alex Lindsey, I think you should kick things off with
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:52.080]   your pick of the week. Andy has not spent enough money yet today. It might not be very expensive.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.440]   I mean it's connected to something expensive but it's not expensive itself. It's called Monitor Plus.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.800]   And for those of you using Sony cameras like myself, Monitor Plus lets you
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:05.040]   tie your iPhone to it. One of the big problems with not using a black magic camera with all the
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:10.240]   other black magic stuff is I can't shade the camera anymore. And so I was complaining about it.
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:14.080]   And of course people started sending me the links and I started downloading the links. And the one
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:19.280]   that I found to be the most stable is Monitor Plus. It's actually pretty easy to link into. Once the
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:26.480]   phone is set, I can be controlled. You simply turn it on. It will ask you, do you want to join the
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:33.760]   Wi-Fi connection? And then you basically get, and I'm having trouble getting my phone to output to
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:39.280]   my switcher, but I was able to connect to it. So you'll see here, this is what I see, which is I
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.400]   have a little bit of a histogram. Ooh, look at that. That's a scope. And then I have the
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.400]   thing. And then I have controls. And so now with my phone, I can look at it and I do this to make
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:53.440]   you apply a lot while you're watching. I can't apply a lot, but you can see me. That's my phone.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:59.840]   I'm just sitting there with my phone. Oh, it's awesome. That's my ISO. So I have, I can actually
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.320]   go in here and make some of that. I haven't tried to change the lot for it itself, but I
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:09.280]   definitely can make adjustments to a lot of parts of it. And again, having the histogram built right
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.600]   into it is really nice because I can take a look at it and just know whether I'm in the right
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:20.320]   space or not. So it's a pretty slick look. I can go into my color. For instance,
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.720]   Sony has its own app, which is total crap. The imaging, whatever they call it, Sony imaging
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:32.800]   plus, I use an a seven R four and yeah, this would be great. Is it just for video? It's just for video.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:37.840]   I only use it with video. It might do other things. I have to admit, my experience right now
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:42.720]   has been mostly to control the video, but it does support all of their vlogging cameras too,
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.360]   which is a lot of sense. Yeah. So it's been, it's one of the big
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:51.440]   gotchas when you're not, because the great thing about the Blackmagic cameras is once you plug them
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:55.040]   into the switcher, you're able to control them, shade them, do a lot of other things. And so
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:59.120]   having something else that gets closed, it's not quite the same level of control or fluidness that
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:03.040]   you have with a Blackmagic camera. It's just that the autofocus on the Sony is really nice.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:08.720]   So it's so anyway, so it's, but anyway, monitor plus works pretty well. Great.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:15.600]   Hey, this just in too. Thank you, Scooter X in our IRC. Half an hour ago, Apple pushed out new
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:25.280]   firmware for the Beats Studio Buds, the AirPods Pro. This has been promised. And I think this would
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:31.760]   be the transparency stuff and the auto adapt, adaptivity stuff and so forth. So I don't think
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:36.400]   if you have a Beats Pros or AirPods Pros, you'd have to do anything. I imagine as soon as you hook
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.760]   them up to your phone and update the firmware. So that's good news. That's good news.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:49.600]   And Alex has picked once again, monitor plus. It's on the app store from Han in On.
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:54.160]   Yeah, that's not very good. And it was one of the things, there's a lot of other people that made
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:58.240]   them. I just found this one to be the easiest one to connect to have it. Why don't I have work
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:03.120]   and it's three units. So yeah. And you can use it with Wi-Fi, but it also supports earlier,
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:10.400]   like the a7 III with USB. So yeah, use it wired. Thank you, Alex. Andy and I've got
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:16.400]   you have a pick. Make it good. Yes, it's kind of interesting. Something I hadn't seen before.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:24.960]   I'm trying. I'm evacuating myself from Evernote, which because you still there really, wow.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.840]   Well, because for and I get into my pick, as a matter of fact, because one of the things in my
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:35.520]   workflow is that I need to be able to, when I find something on the web that I need to refer back
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.680]   to for research, when I'm running about something or preparing to talk about something on NPR or
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.720]   on a podcast, like I need to have the actual, you know what happens, things tend to disappear,
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.200]   or you lose internet connectivity when you're kind of desperate to actually get access to it.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.200]   So part of my workflow is to clip the entire webpage. I never know.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:58.080]   Vi, its plug in was really. Oh, yeah. He's doing that. I do it. I love the Evernote.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:03.040]   Yeah. And it was great. Like when I board the train to go into Boston to do radio, I just,
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.800]   you know, pull up my iPad, click on the sync button on Evernote, and now every single website that I,
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:13.760]   every single web article that I'm basing a lot of my talk on is going to have this stuff on it.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.160]   So I'm looking for other workflows for I need to be able to capture web pages.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:24.560]   I found this plug in for pretty much every web browser out there. It's called a mark download,
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:30.560]   and it's just a simple plug in. You click a button and it will download your current webpage
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:37.120]   as in markdown format. And it's very, very robust. It gives you, it creates a readability version
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:40.080]   of it. So it's not as though it's going to try to download like all the buttons and all the ads
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.160]   and stuff, stuff like that. But it gives, it presents you with a window of here's the markdown that I
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.320]   have captured from this, and you have the ability to edit it before it gets saved, and then you can
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.600]   save it. You can also create templates so that if you want to, like I was experimenting with,
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.760]   it's not just the content. I also want to make sure I'm capturing certain metadata so that maybe I
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:03.600]   can script or automate certain things about these pages that I'm downloading. And so you could create
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.720]   the here's what the header should look like. Here's what the footer should look like. You can
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:13.360]   select just parts of this of the site to the webpage to capture. It may not be the one that I use
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:18.560]   permanently, but it was unusual and boy does it work well. It also integrates really, really well
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:22.800]   with Obsidian for people who are using the Obsidian note taker. And the fact that like my,
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:30.000]   my now go to app for most of my, my study and writing is Ulysses, which is based on Markdown.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.240]   There are a bunch of other really great apps that are based on Markdown now. So the ability to
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:40.480]   simply drag that webpage into as a new note into Ulysses without having to worry about, oh, it
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.600]   doesn't, I can't attach a PDF or I can't attach it as this. Working with it as a native thing that
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:50.080]   can then cut and paste text without worrying about where I'm selecting. That's a pretty interesting
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:55.760]   process. I think it's not a screenshot. It's an actual text tool, Markdown based version of the
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.360]   page. I think you wind up with a Markdown text document that's properly formatted.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.360]   Yeah. I'm installing it right now on Firefox. That would be very, very handy.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.960]   And it's free Markdown. It's free. It's different. It's on GitHub, baby.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:15.920]   Mr. Jason Snell, you want to plug your friends book, don't you?
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:23.280]   Since we're plugging friends novels today, I am going to plug my friends novel,
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:29.600]   All Souls Lost by Dan Morin comes out October 17th. It is available for pre-ordering now.
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.560]   I had the good fortune to read it a few years ago. It's been sort of in process for a while.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:41.200]   It's really good. It's an urban fantasy. And the relevance to this show? Well, there's a big tech
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:46.960]   company in it where mysterious, potentially supernatural things may be happening. And
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.960]   if you think that Dan might write what he knows and that that big tech company might resemble,
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:04:00.800]   oh, I don't know, Apple in some way? Well, no similarities between anybody living or dead.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:06.720]   Certainly, certainly not. It's a fun read. And it's coming out. Finally,
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:10.800]   everybody else in the world gets to see it. And definitely I laughed at the big tech company
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.640]   that the main character works for. This looks really fun. It's really familiar.
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:17.760]   I love Dan's reading. And there will be an audiobook. They haven't announced the audiobook yet.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.000]   This is his first book that is not in his Galactic Cold War series, which is ongoing.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.800]   It's an urban fantasy. And it's just a kick. And the fact that, yeah, if you know about Apple,
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:32.720]   and then you will recognize things in it, that's all I can say. Say hello to Mike
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:37.600]   Lucifer's spiritual consultant. He's back in town to take care of business.
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:43.520]   Unfortunately, when business is good, things must be very, very bad.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:47.920]   Yeah, he's like your typical noir detective who really doesn't want to be involved and gets
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.720]   involved and then gets his life threatened. And you know, it's that kind of thing. It's a
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:57.040]   noir detective fantasy setting urban fantasy thing. It's great. So people should check it out.
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:01.600]   It feels kind of noir. That's exactly the kind of mess that drove him from home to
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:09.840]   Boston to a sunny beach in the bottom of a bottle. But now he's back in town and he's in trouble.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:14.640]   It's a great setup. It's a fun book. And yeah, October 17th, but you can order it now.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:20.320]   And that's what you should do. Very good. Dan Moore. We all know Dan, it sounds like something
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:25.040]   that Dan had a lot of fun writing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's in his wheelhouse.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:29.120]   I want to give a little plug to an app that you've picked before, Andy. I know you know
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.040]   it and like it. And the fact I thought you might make this your pick of the week bear just came
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:40.480]   out with version two after five years of working on it. All new editor and lots of new features.
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:48.320]   This is a markdown editor that is Apple only iOS, iPad, OS and Mac OS. Free to use,
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:53.040]   although if there are some advanced features, you might want to pay a measly 30 bucks a year for
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:06:00.320]   like syncing. It has full encryption and it is fully marked down capable. So a very nice.
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:06.560]   A lot of people like a very nice editor. I know you use it or have used it right, Andy.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:13.920]   I've used it. Obviously, when I first used it, it seemed too similar to Ulysses for me to consider
[02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:20.640]   switching. And but now this looks like it really has it's gotten to a really nice Ford versus GM,
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:25.040]   a Ford versus Ferrari sort of battle, which is like, oh, they they they
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:32.080]   us together have shown the world that really great markdown based note taking apps are very
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:36.720]   muscular and useful. And now we're basically going to start serving this market in a much more
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:41.760]   much more professional way. It does so many more things. I have I have not I downloaded it. I've
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:46.000]   not tried I've not started playing with it. But I did see a lot of things that I wish that Ulysses
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.800]   had. But the great thing about the great thing about Markdown is that I could simply take all of
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:54.640]   my Ulysses. If I decided to switch to bear, I just switched from one folder to the other.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:07:02.000]   If I decide to sync to create a shared Google Drive folder with all of my like Ulysses projects
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.960]   and Markdown projects, I could even like edit Markdown on my Android phone. And when I open up
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:14.160]   on my Mac or on my iPad or on my iPhone, it won't care. So this is this is why using it using an
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:18.080]   open standard, the space on text files is such a powerful thing. Because you never know what
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:22.000]   changes are going to make in the future. And you're ready for it. You probably already know Markdown
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:28.320]   even if you've never heard of Markdown, John Gruber created it many moons ago. And it is a very
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:35.040]   simple text based way to create formatted text. Many years later, it's it's kind of a power tool
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:40.400]   and bear that's bears file format, which means, you know, it's it's open and you're not stuck.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:45.600]   And bear is famous for its editor. They've got a new editor now that they've put up on the test
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:51.760]   flight of that editor for like three years. Free a freak in the law. It's long in the
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:59.440]   way. It's not just, Hey, now we've added kerning is like, no, we basically, we basically decided to
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:04.080]   do a frame off restoration of this. Yeah, now it's basically a brand new car. It looks really if
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:10.480]   it were cross platform, it'd be a no brainer for me. It really looks good. And yeah, your stuff is
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:14.080]   stored locally. And that's important. Although if you want the sinking, it's in iCloud as well.
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:22.880]   That I we got Jason, we got Andy, we got Alex, I think we got everybody a special thanks to Ray
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:31.280]   Maxwell for showing us his Mac Pro today. Glad to get that review in. If you don't like the Mac Pro,
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:36.960]   then listen to update this week and you'll feel much better about your life, right Jason?
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:42.960]   Exactly. You know, it'll change. Now, my look, what I said about the Mac Pro is that it's the
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:47.600]   least important Mac, but that's to Apple because it sells in such small quantities. But if it's the
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:51.200]   Mac for you, then it's the most important Mac. That's what I'm saying upgrade is one of the many
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:59.600]   podcasts Jason does. This one's on relay.fm. If you go to six, I found you six colors.com/Jason,
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.120]   you'll find everything Jason does. Thank you, Jason Stone. We always appreciate you in here.
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.400]   Yeah. Thank you, Andy and Akko. What are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:14.880]   Thursday at 1230 Eastern Time, go to wgbhnews.org to stream it live or stream it later.
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:21.200]   Wonderful and stay dry. Get your hip weighters on and go down to the 711.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:26.640]   Staying inside will do it, but I also have air conditioning. So I will also be staying dry
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:34.880]   from my own self-basting for the first year. How nice. Congratulations. I'm already, I've
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.440]   rejected every impulse that my inner dad voice has given me saying, "Oh, come on, it's only 81
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:44.960]   degrees." It's not really hot yet. But when you can just simply say, "How about if we just keep
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:49.200]   a 68 degrees in the entire house always?" It's like, "Damn it. That's a good argument." It's a nice
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:53.920]   feeling when you finally give in because I know exactly how you feel and turn it on and it's
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:10:01.200]   suddenly cool and it's like, "Oh, that's available. I'm no longer having to swallow the air because
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:07.360]   it's so thick and it's actually dry, potable air." The planet may be burning, but I'm comfortable.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:14.400]   Thank you very much. Thank you, Alex Lindsey, office hours dot global. Tell us about what's up there.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:22.720]   Oh, we had a mission. Ooh. Yeah, we had a busy week as always. We had a great session with a
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:28.880]   project manager from AWS yesterday talking really about how to plan projects. Today, we talked about
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:33.680]   the overall pipeline of 3D production, which was really, really great. Alan Hawks, who's just an
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.240]   incredible production 3D production person, was really giving the overview. He's going to do a year
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.360]   and a half at once a month talking about different aspects of the 3D pipeline. We're talking about
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:50.720]   acoustical panels tomorrow because it's audio day. We have Chris Seger, who's NBC Universal's
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:56.880]   director of advanced content production, coming in on Thursday with Michael Drazden and Jim Toden.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.960]   These are the guys that work on Thursday night football and they're going to be talking about
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:06.480]   HDR objective color metrics. I mean, this is a deep hour and you might like that, Matt.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:12.640]   So I think that Ray might enjoy this one. These are the guys you better show up for this one.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:18.080]   Yeah, yeah. They are spending, they've been building the NBC LUTs and all the other things to figure
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:24.560]   out how to do consistent, perfect color going from HDR to HDR back to SDR, all those other things.
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:28.160]   And so they're going to be talking about that. Friday is a little more relaxed. We're just showing
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.520]   a bunch of our projects and talking about what worked and didn't work and answering questions.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:36.400]   And then Saturday, we're talking about audio description with Joel Snyder, who is really
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:42.320]   one of the key people who created it. And our accessibility Saturdays have turned into quite a
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.400]   thing. I mean, we're experimenting with adding accessibility. We have deaf panelists and ASL
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.080]   and we're adding a lot of other bits and pieces and really understanding what the
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.400]   challenges are and working with everybody. It's turned out to be a really good Saturday.
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:01.520]   So anyway, that's the, that's this week. Free, open it all. You can be in the zoom. If you want,
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.800]   you have to go to the page and ask, fill out the join us form. But you can also watch the

[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:22.800]   Thanks for being here, everybody. We'll see you next time now. It's time to get back to work
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:29.680]   because break time is over. Bye bye. Oh, hey, that's a really nice iPhone you have there.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:35.200]   You totally picked the right color. Hey, since you do use an iPhone and maybe use an iPad or an
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:40.800]   Apple Watch or an Apple TV, well, you should check out iOS today. It's a show that I,
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:46.720]   Mike Asargent and my co-host Rosemary Orchard host every Tuesday right here on the Twit Network.
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:53.360]   It covers all things iOS, TVOS, HomePod OS, Watch OS, iPad OS. It's all the OSSs that Apple has on
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:57.280]   offer. And we love to give you tips and tricks about making the most of those devices,
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:10.640]   checking out great apps and services and answering your tech questions. I hope you check it out.
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:19.200]   That's the sound of a crack in the ceiling found at a home inspection. But with a real
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:24.080]   tour by your side, a new found leak might only cause minor worries. With their expertise,
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:28.160]   a realtor can suggest a credit at closing and even connect you to a contractor to help you
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.720]   shore up that leak and alleviate your worries. When it comes to cracks in your plans, the expertise
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:38.000]   of a realtor can make all the difference. The difference between an agent and a realtor is real.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.480]   Realtors are members of the National Association of Realtors. That's who we are.
