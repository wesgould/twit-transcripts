Yeah, it's just once yours, which they  can't do for this one. But I imagine there I mean, Andy was talking about the shortage of  antibacterial wipes and all that. I'd imagine there's shortage in the Cupertino area because  they've all been purchased and are all or Apple. Maybe they designed their own. They're going to be

This is make something  wonderful. Steve Jobs in his own words. Jameson, who I don't know, sent me this and I looked and  you can't buy it printed. It is the contents are on the Steve Jobs archive and they printed a few

Because Bob Iger was Bob Iger was really happy about it. So yeah, I got from listener YM who  works at ABC sent me one, which is awesome. But yeah, they're real, they're real rare and they're  going on eBay and all of that. But if you've got a friend who works at ABC, you might be able to get

This is,  I mean, you could read it online, like I said, but there's some really great stuff in this. All of  this was created by Laurene Powell jobs, his widow and close friends to kind of preserve Steve's  legacy, you know, and it's interesting stuff like this. Do you have an over the shoulder or should  I hold it up? Which, which would you like me to do? This is a, a piece, a memo on a Pixar notepad,  a little note says Steve president Clinton is holding is that one. And then Steve sitting under  the Pixar lamp. I don't know if there's a, a forced perspective there for that actually is a giant

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would hope it wouldn't squish you. Here's a, here's Steve very happy with Minnie and Mickey.  I wonder why. I wonder why. But my, one of my favorite parts is, is a series of memos  from Steve between Steve and Andy Grove. Did you read those? Anybody? Yeah. Yeah. They're  really, oh, there we go. Now we have it. You know, I'll have to show it on the web though,  because you can't, you can't really pick up the book, but it starts with an engineer from Intel.  This is while Steve's at Pixar. Let me see if I can find it saying, hey, we'd like to share  information so we can make our Intel processors better. You guys really seem to know a lot.  Oh, you have to, it's an e-reader book or you could get it on Apple.

Start time: 411.34
End time: 503.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there it is. Read now. Sorry. So the Intel engineer says, you know, hey, I'd like to come over  and we can have a little meeting. You could tell me all the secret stuff you've learned about  graphics to which Steve says, you know, we, we put a lot of energy and time and money into that. How  much are you going to pay me? To, to which the engineer says, well, I was just thinking of an  information exchange. We're not going to pay you anything. Nevermind. And then Andy Grove,  the chairman of Intel sends a note to Steve saying, Hey Steve, you know, when we got together,  I shared stuff with you. It may be not as valuable as the graphics information that you've learned  at Pixar, but you know, I felt like the open exchange of information was kind of part of this  and that, you know, it seemed reasonable that, you know, you would, you would participate.  There's Steve outside the IBM offices giving him the finger in 1983. Not a good move. And,  and, and then Steve says, and this is what's amazing. I was wrong. He says, you're right.  You're absolutely right. I've changed my position 180 degrees. And he ends up saying, come on over  engineer. Let's talk. Really, really an amazing exchange and a different kind of Steve, to be  honest. I didn't, you don't expect him to say, I, I was wrong. I'm going to change my position

Start time: 504.22
End time: 548.04
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  180 degrees. This is a story you hear from the people who work with him closely though, is that  he would be vociferously on one side of an issue, but the moment you convinced him that you were  right, he would be vociferously on the other side of the issue as if he thought of it himself. In  fact, but like, I think, and they want to reinforce that in the Steve jobs archive. That's what  they're trying to do is bring out this, these documents that reinforce that aspect of Steve  jobs that once he got convinced that he was wrong, he didn't hold onto it. And it is, I mean,  we can talk about all sorts of weird traits that Steve jobs had and the ones that might not make  you want to work with him, but this is a really good trait of his, which is the moment he was  convinced he was wrong, he just let it go and said, okay, I was wrong. And so many people never do

Start time: 548.22
End time: 611.01
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  that. Yeah, there was a famous, there was a really great story. In one of the anniversaries  of the original Mac launch, they had like the entire like Mac team. I think this was out of Mac  hack along long time ago, but Bill Atkinson told us to tell a story about Steve like, well, you  know, we're pinching pennies trying to like get all these graphics primitives. He's the guy who  did all the graphics routines for the original Mac OS and the original ROMs. Like we just couldn't,  we just desperate to get all this code to fit. And then Steve comes in my office and says, we  should have rounded rectangles as a type. And I said, well, that's a waste of time. And then he  took me on a walk around the neighborhood and pointed out license plates and traffic signs  and billboards and all the places where there are rounded rectangles in nature. And then I see him  and he convinced me that, you know, we absolutely have to do that. And then there's a bow, warm,  like applause. Oh, that's, you know, that was Steve, that was Steve. And I forget who else,  who was on the panel, who said, yeah, what you don't know is that I use that exact same walk to  give in Steve of that, like just two days earlier. Hey, he, he, uh, he absorbed the lesson

Start time: 615.40
End time: 646.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and he took it in and regurgitated it. Um, it is really a wonderful, uh, book.  The print version is not out, but you can download it. It is free on Apple books.  It's a free on the Libby app. If you have a participating library or you can just  download it from the site or even read it on the site. Um, it's really cool. I have to say,  and I was Jamison, I don't know you, but I love you, man. Thank you for sending me,  my own copy of this. That's it's really, it's cool to have it in book form.

Start time: 647.94
End time: 678.20
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  Really, really neat. I hope they've released like at least a paperback version of it because  there's something tangible on paper that it's, it's when people, uh, when, when, when people go to a  library, they see things on the shelf. When people go into your house, you know, your guests over,  when you have family members in there, they see something they can take down off of a shelf.  I, I think it's an important enough book that I hope that, uh, that it becomes a paperback. I would,  I would, I would easily pay money for this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess you could download it and,

Start time: 678.46
End time: 707.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and print it at Lulu or somewhere and get a pretty close fix. I'm sure this was just in time  printed. Um, Jamison does rebel little salt in the wound. His note saying love to it and all  your shows windows weekly is by far my favorite. You really knocked it out of the park bringing  Richard and he's great. I love the cohesion you three have together and laugh so hard at all.  Paul's witty humor doesn't mention, uh, Mac break weekly at all. Maybe he was trying to get rid of  this book. I think maybe that's the, that's the truth. I don't want this. I'm a windows guy.

Start time: 712.92
End time: 747.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  is exactly right. And I don't blame you. I don't blame you. Uh, all right. You all act as if we  are for sure going to see a nerd helmet to use Joanna Stern's lovely, uh, uh, colloquialism,  on Monday. Uh, you know, Glenn Fleischman, uh, has been, uh, to offering bets saying we may see it,  but they'll never offer it for sale in 2023. He said not this year. What do you guys think?  Jason, you, you feel like you will be wearing a nerd helmet next week this time. Yeah. I mean,

Start time: 747.72
End time: 805.36
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think that it's happening because I think fundamentally if everybody believed it was  happening and it wasn't happening, Apple would have leaked it somewhere to diminish expectations  and Apple is not doing that. I think we see a wall street journal article. Yeah. Yeah. They got it  wrong. Everybody got it wrong. Yeah. According to people familiar with the matter. Yeah, exactly.  And instead I do think Glenn has an outside shot at being right in the sense that this sounds like  a product that is not going to be ready until the fall or, you know, late fall. And at once  you're in late fall, you're in December. And you know, what we always, uh, back when I did a space  podcast, we always used to say end of year is next year. Like later this year is next year.  It could be that's the case with the headset too. Um, but I think it's, they're going to announce  something. The question is just sort of what the ship date is and will they even say by the end of  the year or will they say later or coming soon or something vague like that? And also the price is  the same thing. I don't think personally, I don't think they're going to announce a price because

Start time: 805.50
End time: 835.28
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  they don't need to cause it's nowhere near shipping. Yeah. Yeah. And the people, and the people who want  this are going to spend whatever they got to spend for it. They know it's not a consumer item. And  if there's something with all these little trickling pizza bits of information that we would expect to  be hearing a write about now or last week about, uh, about confirming that this something is  happening has happened. Like for instance, the, a lot of, uh, writers and bloggers who talk  specifically and exclusively about AR and VR have received invites to the event. That's pretty much

Start time: 835.40
End time: 926.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  a slam dunk. Yeah. And I think that, you know, the public version of this is probably late 2024,  like the, you know, like 20, late 2024, early 20, 20, more than a year from now. Yeah. So when  we're talking about, they're releasing something, he may be right. They're not going to release a  commercial version, but they're going to release a developer version and then develop a version  will probably ship before this end of this year, spring of next year. They want people to, um,  you know, and so, but I think that it's, it is, uh, um, but I think that the commercial version  is still a solid 12 to 18, maybe 24 months out. Um, and there, but they need people to build  content. They need people to build content. They need people to understand it. They need to have  people digging into it. And so I think that if they can sell a couple million units and get that,  that really key gamma testing, beta testing, gamma testing out there and give the developers  time to make sure that this is a crisp platform, what really has damaged these platforms in the  past is publicly released public releases without great content. You know, you put them on, you get,  you get the play Robo recall for, you know, three hours and, uh, and then what do you do after that?  You know, and every, and almost everything else after that is kind of dorky, you know, and so,  so I think that, I think that they're going to come out. I think we're going to see a lot of  content and a lot of partners out of the gate. They're going to tell you, they're going to show  everybody, Hey, look at all these people that are already using it. You don't want to be left behind  by the developer one and start making content for it because this is the next thing, you know,  and I think that that's where they're going to probably jump into it, but they're going to give  the developers a solid year and a half to, um, work on it. All right. Apple historians,

Start time: 928.09
End time: 936.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  is there precedent for this? Has Apple ever released something that early and said, you can't  buy it. We want developers to try it, use it, develop for it, and we'll see in a year and a half.

Start time: 937.64
End time: 941.50
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't know if there's ever been precedent for, for this level of what,

Start time: 942.40
End time: 995.48
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  well, I mean, not Alex is saying that for this level. And I think he's right there,  but Apple has released several times a developer kit. They did it for Apple silicon. They did it  for Intel. Um, there was the transition kit. It was actually like a, a Mac pro case that had,  that was before they were selling and before they were selling Intel, Intel's Mac.  And before they were selling Apple silicon, they had it for developers. The difference this time  is this product by all accounts is a product that anybody will be able to buy. And so when  Alex describes it as being a developer kit, I don't think it will be phrased that way. I think that  I don't honestly don't think Apple is wired that way to say this is just for developers.  I think they hope that some early explorers will also buy it, but I do think it'll probably be a  de facto development kit because it's so expensive. Here's from ScooterX, the Wikipedia article

Start time: 996.48
End time: 1022.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  on the developer transition kit, the name of two prototype Mac computers made available to  software developers in the transition to Intel and then, and then in the transition,  Apple silicon. So yeah. So in 2005 at WWDC jobs said, this is a development platform only. This  is not a product that will never be shipped as a product. They made you, made you send them back.

Start time: 1023.00
End time: 1026.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's just for you guys to get started and develop it. You know, I can actually, you'll have to

Start time: 1026.36
End time: 1067.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  return them by the end of 2006. We don't want them floating around out there. These are not products.  I can see those exact words coming out of Tim Cook's mouth or whoever for this headset. So  that's what I guess that's the only disagreement here. That's kind of Glenn's feeling is, is like  me that, well, they're going to, I would say Apple say, this is not what the product's going to look  like. This is, there won't be a battery in your pocket. This is not the consumer product. This is  a breadboard for people who want to learn about XROS and want to develop for it. And we'll see you  in a couple of years with an actual consumer product. That makes sense. Actually. I think a

Start time: 1067.94
End time: 1091.94
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  lot of that makes sense, particularly if you go to the point of they want to be able to simply  correct correctly, they want to be able to dismiss a lot of questions about usability and about its  convenience as a consumer product. One of them being that, oh my God, Apple would never have  an external battery pack. Well, Apple did, but this isn't a consumer thing. This is to get this  thing out the door. I think it will be a lot more polished than like a breadboard prototype

Start time: 1092.48
End time: 1106.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  or anything like that. Well, they've been making them. I mean, according to all the sources,  including Mark Gurman and Digitimes and Ming-Chi Kuo, they've been building them and they've been  buying screens from Samsung or Sony and you know, they've been actually making them. Honestly,

Start time: 1106.84
End time: 1133.92
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  I'm sure I'm certain that they are just very quickly. I'm certain that they already have some  in the field. I'm sure that they have some trusted developers who already have them so that during  this presentation next week, they can do the almost traditional. And now we gave some hardware to our  friends at some of the something and like to invite them on to show you what they were able  to accomplish in such a quick turnaround that they can say, right. So that's by the way,

Start time: 1134.04

Transcript:  the other problem with selling these, which Microsoft learned and Meta learned is it's really  impossible to demo them, you know, because it's an experience. It's not on, you can't see it on a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  in the mic when they had stores in the Microsoft stores and said, come on in. They were in the back  and they invited everybody to try them because it's the only thing you can do. Yeah, you have to do

Start time: 1157.82
End time: 1200.64
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  it, but it's going to be hard. But I think we are arguing in some ways over a marketing point because  I think the price, if it's a $3,000 product, it's going to limit who buys it regardless of whether  they call it a developer product or not. There is no evidence. I thought for a long time that they  just call this a developer preview, right? There's no evidence that they're going to do that. I think  they know there are enough people out there who will buy it regardless of it being a 1.0 piece of  hardware with very little software for it for $3,000 because they just want to have it. And so I think  that that's the thing where they're going to, my suspicion is they're going to say it is for early  adopters and developers, but they're not going to do the thing where they say it's just for  developers and you have to return it to us or anything like that. I think they're just going

Start time: 1200.72
End time: 1296.08
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  to sell them. I don't think you're going to return it, but I do think they may require you to be a  developer. Remember, there's 30 million developers, registered developers for that. So there's still  a pretty big market for them just to sell it into that market. You may have to put your $99 in to  buy it or whatever. They may make you jump over that hump more for optics than anything else.  They don't want another $100. They just want the optics of this is the developer version.  You buy the developer version, you're free to buy this device and people who are going to pay  $3,000 will pay $3,100 without any real issue there. I do think that they'll sell as many as  they can make. And there'll be a lot of people that buy them and leave them in the box. They're  just going to leave them shrink wrapped in the box. These are going to be the collector versions  of these. I bet you $100,000 to $500,000 will just go into people's like, I just want one stuck in  there because this is going to be, I think that people are going to be pretty excited about it.  It'll either be an epic failure or an epic, but both Jason and I still have our cubes. I have my  cube right there. I had a cube. I foolishly gave it away. I wish I still had it. So anyway, so  you know, we all, even if it doesn't work out perfectly, we all like to keep them around. So  so the, so I think that it's going to be, I do think that this is, I think they'll show hundreds,  hundreds of people, hundreds of partners, not like 10 partners or five partners. They're going to show  a lot of partners. They'll have a screen with a lot of logos. Well, I think they're going to show a  lot of actual use cases. I won't show hundreds of use cases. So Mark Gurman tweeted two weeks ago

He also, I've also seen rumors and he mentions that no man's sky for the Mac, which was announced  last year, but has not come out. There's some thinking maybe no man's sky for there is a VR  version on the PC side might come out with this. I tell you what, if I could play Metal Gear, if I  could be a mech in one of these, I might wear a nerd helmet. I might, you know, they'd have to  solve the movement issue though. That's the problem.

They can just say, we're going to have someone develop this game and put it into, you know,  put it into the arcade as well. So Apple arcade can be something that they can take the risk away  from developers to develop for. So it could be. I expect a little bit. You know who believes

Transcript:  Yeah. That's why I've seen, I've already seen some like maybe click baity coverage and hot takes  saying, oh, well, the real things is from Apple is going to come until 2024, but when it does,  Apple's going to run the table. They're going to, they're going to own this, this category.  And that's, that's very, that's very possible given that they, given how, given how much trust  they've built up with people buying Apple products, maybe even spending the lecture for Apple products  and how good their developer channel is. But nonetheless, all of that is, is, is based on the  idea that Apple has a specific vision that is going to be flexible enough to cover anything  anybody wants to do with it. It's possible that Metta or some other, some other producer that we  haven't even heard of yet is going to not, not be the 90% of the marketplace, but be really,  really successful against Apple by virtue of the fact that, look, we're not going to handcuff you.  We're not going to, we're not going to make sure that, oh, well, you have to use iCloud  for, for syncing. Well, but I don't, my app doesn't use files. Well, you still have to use  iCloud for file syncing or else we want to prove you. So, so there's still a lot of variables coming

Transcript:  in here. One thing that's interesting, at least when I read between the lines of German's post,  is the focus on mixed realities. He, he talks about the video pass through performance.  He says it will be close to that of the Apple device, which will have about a dozen cameras.  More and more, we're moving away from this virtual reality world to  an augmented or mixed reality world where you can see what's going on around you. And it seems like  both Metta and Apple, from what we've heard, pure, pure rumors in both cases, are now starting to  focus more on that. Does that make sense? Is that a little bit of a pivot? I feel like the rumor that

Start time: 1543.10
End time: 1600.54
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  they had the equivalent of the digital crown that they were going to put on this thing to let you  dial it between reality, augmented reality and virtual reality, that, that, that was always part  of their, their idea here that, you know, you can almost hear Johnny Ive saying, but we don't want  them to feel cut off from the world. You can do a lot of things that are, the example I always give  is that table tennis game. I think I gave it here last week that I play, like to play ping pong on  the Quest 2. It's great, but it's in a, it's, I'm completely cut off because it's in a virtual space.  And the idea that I could flip a switch and on the Quest 2, the quality of the cameras outside is  are terrible, but on a good one where I could put that virtual ping pong table in reality so that I  could still see if my dog comes in or a cat comes in or my wife goes to the door and is like, what  are you doing? I think that that's way better, honestly, not for all uses, but just the idea  that you have sort of this two context switchable thing so that you aren't completely cut off from

Start time: 1600.68

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Transcript:  instantaneous or you will barf for sure. The other thing is, is that you could, that when you talk  about the table tennis, the other thing that they showed last year was all the collision surface  issues that collisions, collision surface processes. So you take your phone, wave it around.  There's no reason why this device, as you start to walk, as soon as you put it on, it'll sure have  LIDAR and everything else. They can build collision surfaces out of everything around you. So you  could be, you could be, it's not just that you could be, you could be playing in the environment.  It looks like the environment, but invisibly you could be firing things and ducking behind your,  imagine playing, shooting like laser tag or something with your friends.  And you could hide behind the couch, like, you know, like, you know, that's there. So it gives  you a lot of really interesting opportunities. Most of the seasickness actually really doesn't  come from VR. It comes from the frame rate. So this gets back into why the frame rate has to be  higher, higher range. Disney used to have this, they had a test in Orlando. They'd bring poor  college students in and they would turn the frame rate down to see when they, when they blew up.  It's okay. Cause they're trying to figure out what's the minimum frame rate. It turns out  it's between 12 and 18 frames. If you're near 12 frames, you're a fighter pilot and you're 18,  you're 16 frames per second. You're kind of average. And somewhere there you blow chunks.  And so- By the way, I contend that it is not merely

Start time: 1706.04
End time: 1743.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  frame rate. That's what I think all the headset manufacturers say because it is the easiest  thing for them to fix. It's not just latency. It's the discrepancy between,  you know, two kinds of focus. What your inner ear is saying about your eyes.  It's that, but also the fact that your eyes are focused on a near field object, but your head is  looking at things at a distant object. And that mismatch is very hard to solve because those  screens are right here. And I think that that's, that's what Walter, was it Walter Murch? Somebody  pointed this out. And I, I think that that's perhaps more intractable. That's why they don't

Start time: 1743.54
End time: 1753.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  mention that. When we, when we worked on that in the lab, a lot of it had to do with the fact that  the latency is what I say seasick, the, what you're talking about, gay people headaches.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  some people get headaches from me looking at that, I'm really there, but the seasickness would seem  to be very related to inner ear, inner ear positions because they're in, in, in for,  for a million years, for a million years, if you, if your inner ear didn't agree with your eyes,  you're being poisoned, you know, like you, you know, and so that was the, so we're, we're kind

Transcript:  of, I just, I just, every, see the more, the more I talk and think about, about AR and VR,  the more I realize how basic a lot of these problems are where there's, there's, there's  probably this little like tote board, like in every lab saying, okay, are they getting headaches? Yes.  No. Are they, are they vomiting? Yes. No. Are they peeing themselves? Damn it. We still gotta save

Start time: 1797.12
End time: 1822.62
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  that. We gotta save that. Here's a, here's a crazy one. People with, with blue eyes have different,  have it respond to the screens differently than brown eyes. And so it's a funny, it, it, no,  it's true. It's, it's, and so we, we, you have different, different, more problems with people  with blue eyes and clear eye, like really bright blue or eyes have more problems with the sets than,  than brown eyes. And no one talks about that either. And you, and you, and you still have a

Start time: 1823.84

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  problem of you have no peripheral vision. So there's always going to be the question of,  there's so many fundamental questions that can only, are only going to be answered once we have  these out there with the understanding that, look, we have, we don't know how to make this. You can  help us make it if you want to have this really great game platform, but also tell us like, what's  making you nauseous? I mean, on the, we still, one of the basic questions that we still have to ask  is that like, when we're wearing these kinds of devices, let's, let's, let's, let's get the  augmented reality off the table. We're not talking about like glasses with clear lenses and wave  guides that you can actually really for real see the, the, the world around you. Is it more  appropriate to voluntarily say, Hey, I'm putting on these goggles and therefore I'm entering an  artificial environment with some awareness of the outside. So they don't like put my, put my fist  through a wall unless I intend to do so, or are we looking at an environment where this is going to  be alongside what I do. So I'm going to have cameras that let me see the person who's sitting  across the table, but we're both looking at this model that's on the physical table in front of  us. These are things that we haven't figured out. And a lot of this is going to be how we decide  things as a society that when we have a lot of, when the conferences started and meetings started  incorporating like laptops and laptops now have like all day battery. So of course people are  going to have their laptops with them. We kind of adjusted society to realize that, okay, I have a  computer in front of me, but that doesn't mean I'm not paying attention. I'm just simply referring  to notes so that I can refer, so I can answer questions for you or take notes as we go. So it's  still, it's still a face-to-face meeting, not through this technology. How are we going to,  how are we going to adjust to these goggles? Are we going to be interacting with each other or  we're going to be interacting through the technology? This is what's going to be fasting

Start time: 1928.34

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  by the next couple of years. And I do think that if you look at, you know, Apple, I think gave us  some hints to this. If you go to the Apple store, this right outside the spaceship,  they've got this thing of the, of Apple campus, you know, where you can look through an iPad  and you can look at it and adds all this extra data to it. So it's a very basic framework that  they add everything on top of it. And so you could see how, and they have a bunch of iPads  going around the outside edge. I would, I would not be surprised. I wouldn't say that I guarantee  it, but I would not be surprised if the next demo of that is you put headsets on and you look at it  and you just see it, you know, and you can interact with it. Being able to grab onto your hands is  really important. I mean, I was in SGI had a test of this, I don't know, 25 years ago, where you  could go like this, you can put your hands out and go, I want a sphere this big, and it just appear,  you know, and, or you'd say sphere, like it wasn't, you couldn't say, I couldn't, but, but the,  but it would pop up and you could just scale it and you could do all the things you, and that was  25 years ago. And, but, you know, I don't know, probably a $20 million facility.

I don't know about  entertainment or productivity. The one bit of this technology that I think that Apple can do a really  wonderful thing with is, is simply hand tracking so that I no longer have, you don't have to have  to have any kind of control in your hand, nor would I want to. I can pick up objects and just  gesture and be as, make 3D gestures as important as the mouse was earlier on. But even then,  now that I say that out loud, how do you make virtual reality usable by everybody, not just  people who have full dexterity with their hands? So God, there's so many unanswered questions here.

Transcript:  I do think we're on our way to, you put the goggles on, whatever they're going to call them,  and you are Tony Stark at some point. You know, like, give me this, rotate this around.  It could be in a better movie.  But I'm just saying that it's, that you have an Iron Man kind of, like, that's what you want to,  that's how you want to interact with things is you're trying to think through them. And, you know,  being able to just kind of pull things apart and look at them, it does make a difference. Like,  when you can pull something apart and look at it. And I think that, you know, I could see,  I know it will look goofy, but I can see IKEA giving me something. I put the goggles on and it  says, okay, pick that up next. And now do this. And they can put on the little digital thing now  with half the swearing. Not on none of the swearing, but just half of the swearing that's  required to put together in IKEA furniture. You know, but you could have a lot of instructions  on how to do things and working with folks about it. I think it's going to be, again, I think Apple  has done, if, if, if Apple and, you know, they may fail, but if they fail, it's dead.  They'll fit. Well, they'll fit. If they can't make it work.  I was showing USDZ, we were talking about USDZ in office hours this morning, and I was showing  stuff that I suddenly realized that we made that three years ago. Like, you know, that was three  years ago and that was still like, you know, Apple, that was, you know, doing 3D models inside of  motion inside of, you know, like rotating them around there. You know, you can open a USDZ model  right now in, you can download a 3D model from the Smithsonian and open it in preview. And you have  since 2020. So this is how long that runway has been to land this. And I think that, you know,  I mean, Apple, I think was, this is almost a 10 year project. If they, if, and you know, they're,  they've lined up as many ducks as you can line up without coming out of the gate. Like, like,  I don't think that there's any, so if they can't figure it out, no one can. And we can all give up

Transcript:  and move on. We talk about Mark Zuckerberg and like he and Tim Cook and Apple and Facebook and  do not track app tracking transparency, all these ways that they're battling and they're potentially  battling here. But I would submit to you, nobody wants the Apple headset to succeed more than Mark  Zuckerberg because it validates his strategy and it validates this category. And I really,  I agree with Alex completely. If Apple belly flops, it kills the category. Maybe it'll come  back in 10 or 15 years, but it will, it will, it will murder it dead because no one will invest.  If Apple can't make it work, nobody is going to invest in anyone else trying.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And the crazy thing is, is that, that Facebook may just stop making headsets. Like they're not  a hardware company, you know, and they're not a very good hardware company. And so, so the thing  is, is that, is that nothing that they've done has been particularly successful when it comes  to hardware. And so, you know, this may be, they were working on, working on, working on,  now it's on the Apple headset and they're like, Hey, why don't we just use, why don't we just give

Transcript:  up and use that? This could be a new message pad where those of us who are into technology,  we're like, Oh my God, this is groundbreaking. Oh my God, this is what the next generation  computers can be. But then it was, it was fell flat because of A, they couldn't make a case for  general use out of it. The general consumers B, the components that they needed to make this  really, really work well, the display technology, the battery technology, the wireless technology  wasn't there yet. And the infrastructure wasn't there yet. So it's possible that Apple is really  jumping early that they, they're, they're squandering a chance to be, to absolutely run the  table again, like in eight years, because they're trying to get this happening like a year from now.  And just like, just like, you know, you can't say the word Google glass without the connotation of  a loser. We don't want the, that same connotation to have to this like early hardware.

Transcript:  I do want to point out though, and we talked about this on Sunday on Twitter,  and I own three message pads that, yes, the Newton, I guess you could say was,  was an unqualified flop, but because of it, Apple formed ARM, the microprocessor company,  they later sold off their stake and did basic and stuff that they needed to create 10 years later,  the iPhone. And it might, this might actually be a very, I think it's a very apt analogy that,  that this could be the Newton of VR. And we may be 10 years off from what we all really want,  which is augmented reality spectacles, you know, glasses that you can wear on your head.

Start time: 2298.64

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  But if we, but if we continue, I'm sorry, go ahead. If we, if we, if we continue the analogy,  realize that the Newton was a big success for handspring. It was a really big success  because it showed, it showed a bunch of really good ideas. And then, and then Palm said, well,  but what if we sold a sold this for just for half the price and made it small and actually  possible of computers and wound up beheaded. Exactly. Exactly.

Transcript:  I do think that it comes down to the performance. And I think that as you read a lot of the behind  the scenes of the ups and downs of some people wanting to be more wearable and at less performance,  I think the design team wanted it to be more wearable and not worry about the performance  as much as some of the other teams. And I'm, I hope that they, I hope that the performance is  key because, because you gotta, I mean, I think that it's, it's a really steep hill if that frame  rate is under 96 frames a second. And it's a really steep hill if the, if the resolution is under six,  six K for I like that's, those are the, I think those are, those are, you know, par for them.  I mean, that, that's that, you know, table stakes, you know, for, for what they have to do.  And if they don't do that, it gets really hard because it just doesn't feel, doesn't feel well.  It doesn't, there's all, a lot of the problems start going away with higher frame rate and  higher resolution. Like it just, and, and it's just a matter of it's, and it is a really hard  thing. Like frame frame, frame rate is not an easy problem. Is there any commercial, so much data

Start time: 2412.32
End time: 2424.56
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  One of the reasons is that one of the reasons is low frame rate and low and lower frame rate and  lower resolution is a big piece of the puzzle. It is, what if people still get sick if the frame

This is a flop, but Apple will snatch victory from the  jaws of the nerd helmet years from now, because it will be much like the Newton, doing the ground  work for something that eventually will really be great, but it is years off because the technology

Transcript:  but go ahead, Andy. I agree with you. I don't, I don't think it's going to flop. I think it's  going to have to, I think it's going to be a success by what Apple chooses to define as a  success for this product. The thing is, in addition to what we've been saying about how Apple has  $182 billion in cash, according to the last quarterly report, they can, they can, they can  keep this going. But the, but the other advantage that this product category category has is that if  it doesn't, if it doesn't do anything with consumers, they can still eke out a victory  by saying, Hey, this is not, this is not necessary. This unit is not necessarily making us a whole lot  of money, but it is, but our, our friends in the military, our friends in medicine, our friends  in training and education all love this.

That's all going to come down in the details of how the story is told, what they  emphasize, who they emphasize that it's for, when it's supposedly coming out, are they going to say  that this is the beginning? Are they going to, like, I think one of the real questions is,  are they going to kind of break with tradition and say, we're, this is the first in a line of  products and sort of promise that there will be more to come down the line that's more affordable.  All of these things are kind of up in the air, but I think this is a huge messaging

This is so we can get this in  the hands of developers. They can learn about XROS, the operating system. They can learn how to code  for it. They could start developing games. Games take four or five years. They can start working  on products for it, but we see this as the first step in a very long journey. And this is not the  final product, not even close. I hope they say that because I think that's the only right thing

I mean, piggybacking on something that Alex said earlier, I like the  idea of, of Apple saying, Hey, this is just, this is, we're only happening to open the list  for developers right now. So basically people who have a hundred bucks to spend and can fill out a  form. But the idea is that if they can create this perception of limited access, it, it solves,  it addresses a whole lot of vectors that they have to solve. And then later on they can say,  Hey, we've are the response to the response and the progress we've had on development of  apps is great. We've decided that we're going to open up a waiting list for ordinary people like  you and me to go buy these things. So basically they have, they'll make a very ample initial run  when they sell out of those, but it looks like they can sell more. They can say, Hey, guess what?  We've, this is moving much, much faster than we thought it was going to be. Here's another  VR event to show off, so show off a new portal that we have to demonstrate VR apps. And now  we're going, we're for the, if you want to spend the exact same price as developers, you no longer  have to spend the a hundred dollar entry fee, the a hundred dollar tip to the concierge to get in.

Transcript:  And I don't know whether Apple's going to, if Apple is going to be as aggressive as Epic,  and which Epic may get aggressive on its own of taking advantage of the headset. But, but the,  but I think that, that one of the things that Epic has done that's incredibly successful has  been the mega grants, the mega grants. I mean, people Epic and, and Unity were like in neck and  neck and no one knew which one was which. And Epic released the mega grants and everyone just  forgot Unity existed in the developer world. Will Apple do something like Unity or will it be  Unity for the VR world? I think they're going to build their own platform. I think that if they  would have bought Unity, they would have bought it already. And the problem is, is it's too big.  Like Unity is like an, I think it's an 18 billion or 15 billion. They need a Unity for  mixed reality. But I think Apple, I think Apple, when Epic went sideways, I think that,  I think, I bet you Apple looked at Unity and thought about it. And I think that the problem  is, is Unity has an incredible amount of technology, but also a fair amount of technical debt.  Right. And so in both Unity and Unreal have a lot of technical debt. So if you're building something  this important to your pipeline, and I think that what Epic, because Epic, what Apple,  Apple was showing Epic at every keynote before they got into the lawsuit. You know, every  keynote that someone from Unreal would come up and talk about and show us something that was cool  and AR and everything else. And then that all died. And I think that the lesson for Apple to  walk away from related to that was, we probably shouldn't put eggs into somebody else's basket.  And so, so I have a feeling that, you know, if you look at the development that Apple's done around  games, around level of detail, calculations around a lot of things that are there, they've already  shown those in developer conferences the last couple of years. I don't think that you'd build  those if you think that you're going to, I don't think you build that if you're, if you are thinking  of really handing it off to somebody else. I think they're going to have their own internal  development tools. I think that I still think that Final Cut and Motion are probably going to be part  of those development tools for video-based kind of things. I think that, you know, they bought into  that a while ago and we've got, you know, we've seen tools, you know, added to those. We'll see  what happens when it actually happens. Maybe they've given up on it, but they put a lot of  VR tools into it. We have to remember that they bought NextVR, so they've got a lot of things  around video development that's there. So I think that, I think Apple's going to probably try to  manage their own destiny, so to speak, with that. And that's a hard road in a lot of ways because,  you know, years of development give you years of tools, so it's expensive. But I do think that the  MegaGrants of getting people, getting developers out there saying, hey, we're developing this right  now. You've got an idea. We've got money. You know, like, you know, like we've got money to have you  help us figure out what the next thing is. And we're going to spend, you know, like I think the  MegaGrants are like a hundred million dollars a year. Apple could easily, it would be a rounding  error for Apple to say we're going to, we're going to seed the market with a billion dollars a year  of funding for people. And what really works with the MegaGrants is that there's no strings attached.  They just give you the money. Like you said, you write them a proposal and they just write you a  check. I know a lot of people that have been pretty successful. I haven't done it, but I keep on thinking  about it. But they just give you the money to work with and they're not asking for a percentage of  your company. They're not asking. So it really is a great, great opportunity. And so I think that if  Apple did a billion dollars a year of seed funding that was public like that, they'd get everybody  thinking about it. And so then you have all these developers with developer kits with a very focused,  like I could actually get money to hold me over for a year to work on this, you know, and to figure  those things out. And it would, I think it would, it would benefit Apple a lot. So they should have  done with iBooks. They could afford it. Not talk to Pearson. They shouldn't talk to Pearson. They  should have just given book developers, if they had given a billion dollars in 2010 to iBooks or  whatever, it would have, we would not have regular books in the way that we think of them right now.

If you want to, if you want it  as a game platform, go to our, go to our Apple arcade where we've, we funded a whole bunch of  games, but it'd be interesting to see how they decide to get their chat app converted to VR,  but also how do they get pages, how they get sheets, how they get keynote for heaven's sakes.

Transcript:  I think that 3D, USDZ and keynote is in the short term is probably more exciting than,  than the headset. And the reason for that is, is that, you know, there's so many of us that do  presentations and we have to throw it through, we find a photo. And what I do a lot of times is I  get 3D models of stuff. I take it into preview because I can open up a USDZ model in preview,  rotate it to the angle that I need it in, and then hit save. And I put it into keynote. That's  crazy. You know, and so the thing is, is that you could be putting it in and as you do the presentation,  you can have things animated, you can have, but even if they're not animated, even if they're just  all still, it just means that you can choose the position and lighting of your object with a little  drop shadow and everything else sitting inside your keynote. It's going to revolutionize,  you know, that, but the biggest thing is, is that the size of the keynote market  will create a huge demand for, for a clip art. So 3D clip art that's useful in the headset,  that's useful in AR, it's useful in motion and everything else. Suddenly everyone buying up,  you know, at, at, at a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars per model or $50 a model,  you sell a certain number. If you have a collection of, of, of 25 models for 10 bucks  that are like classroom models and, and anatomy models and, you know, all of those things,  you could see a lot of people buying a lot of models.

Transcript:  Yeah. But it also points out the, it's not the elephant in the room, but it's something that's  going to have an impact on all this. And when you talk about what is the wave of the future,  obviously it seems to be a fight between, in big companies between AR, VR and generative AI chat  bots. And so on the other side of the coin, you've got Microsoft and Google demonstrating  their AI upgrades to their own presentation apps that say, Hey, you want a piece of art,  tell us what you want. We'll, we'll generate it for you. In addition to stuff like,  the problem with generating a presentation and augmented reality is that everybody has to have  that kind of hardware. Whereas given that this is the communication tool for pretty much every  meeting and every project worldwide, the ability to say, Hey, look, I'm just going to give you some  loose notes. Can you turn this into a slide deck? At least the first, the first draft of a slide  deck for me. So as we go on, it's again, another part of this, I keep saying this is going to be,  this is one of the most interesting couple of years I've, I will, I will live through the idea  of Apple's Apple saying, Hey, we put all this energy into augmented reality because that's  going to be the next, Oh, okay. We don't think that's going to be as big, but we think we can

But I will say it's like negotiating with your, your, your nephew,  the who's on mushrooms and you're going, so I want, I want this. And he goes, you mean this?

You know, and,  and anyway, so, so anyway, so it's, it's a, so I think that that's the challenge with,  with gender AI right now. But I do think that, you know, I think you're going to, I think you are  going to get to a point, even with Apple, where you say, you know, it may not be, there's gender  AI, but there's also like, I'm building out this thing and give me a chair here, you know, give me  a thing here and that, and, and maybe a bunch of chairs pop up and I can discuss it with, with the  system and throw those in. It may not be, it's creating something out of nothing, but it's saying,  would you like any of these Ikea chairs? Oh yeah. I'll take that.

Start time: 3204.72
End time: 3312.02
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  you know, I don't think that's, it's the hardest thing to buy.  That's a terrible example because how often do people use those?  No, no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about buying it. I'm talking about  just using it in your demonstration. So you want to fill out a room and you throw stuff in and  bring it to like, for instance, it'd be great. So no, no, so like, but the, the, the thing is,  is that like, for instance, Kinaflow makes lights, makes the lights that you're under  giving you that highlight that you don't like. The, you know, all these lights, it's fine.  It doesn't look any different than it has ever. I know. I just noticed it. That's all.  So the, so the, so Kinaflow makes all these things. And what they did is they,  they put their lights into SketchUp. I don't know if they did it or somebody else. I think  I'm pretty sure that the company did it. Like somebody, the company modeled them all and added  all the behaviors and did all the other things that were necessary so that you could take full  advantage of Kinaflow's lights inside of SketchUp. And then we all used them. We all use those lights  because those are the easiest ones to add to our, to our preview for showing a client what we were  doing. And then once the client said, yeah, we want to do that project. Well, we just all rented or  bought Kinaflow's because we had, because it was easier to do it. So, so what I'm talking about is  being able to add all these objects to it that are hundreds or thousands of objects that you can add  in. And if you like it at some point, you're just previewing things, you're building virtual worlds,  but instead of building them with generic, generic furniture, like my daughter does interior,  she did, she's, she's passed Roblox now. She's, she's onto Minecraft.  And, but in Roblox, she was buying all this furniture and I was like, I can't believe that  furniture companies aren't like just dumping Roblox with their furniture for people's houses  so that kids get used to looking at their furniture rather than somebody else's furniture.

And that's one reason you might want to watch that coverage as opposed to just watching the  keynote by itself. We're going to really look deeply at what they're saying about these products.  10 a.m. Pacific, that's 1 p.m. Eastern on Monday, a week from yesterday, June 5th,  for the Apple keynote. Last year I kind of stuck around for the developer, the State of the Union  keynote that afternoon. I may or may not, depending on how I feel. Sometimes it's interesting.

But now it's like,  what could they not be talking about? That would be more interesting than the highlight.  I bet it comes at the end because if they really are introducing a few new Macs,  no one's going to pay attention afterwards. You don't put Diana Ross at the start of the show,  you put her at the end of the show, or else nobody's going to hang around to see the comic.

They don't always coincide with product launches, and it may just be that that's a banner day for  Apple, and so they're going to hit the reset button on that day. Like Andy said, I don't know  why you would trickle out a few Macs just before announcing your brand new platform.  That's a weird choice to dilute the message when you could just wait a couple of weeks and get

Start time: 3489.00

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  element? No. Oh, no. It'll be a WWDC keynote, right? So they're going to talk about the new  versions of all the operating systems for sure. That'll all be there. Although I think that's why  the Mac OS State of the Union or the Platform State of the Union is what it is called now,  might be more interesting than usual because I wonder if they're just not going to have enough  time. Push that stuff over to there. To put a lot of detail about what's happening in all the  different new OS versions come the fall, which a lot of us really care about. So I wouldn't be  surprised about that. I would be, I'm going to say it, I would be legitimately surprised if they  basically blow a Mac launch by announcing it at the beginning of an event where everybody's  just going to be talking about the headset. Like why would you choose to do it then?  Yeah.  Unless the headset is, I mean, one possibility, just kind of brainstorming here, is that the  headset, they're taking their foot off the gas of the headset and they're really going to make it a  developer preview and they're going to just do a little tiny bit and they know when they launch it  later, they'll talk about it more. There could be reasons that they want to kind of like,  try to deemphasize it, but I think that they're kidding themselves if they're trying that,  because the fact is if they do anything about the headset, the headset is the headline,  the headset is the subhead, the headset is the first 20 paragraphs, the headset is the sidebar  article, the headset is the third article, right? So if you don't introduce a Mac on Monday,  just don't do it because nobody's going to care.

Last year, we didn't know that we were going to be in the ring, but we actually were in  the Cafe Max sort of pointed out of the ring, but in the ring building.  This year, we also don't know. I mean, I think there's a possibility it could be identical  to last year and we'll all be in that Cafe Max space looking at a Jumbotron essentially.

Transcript:  Well, I was sort of right on the border because what it was, the front rows were out in the sun,  but there were enough people there that you went all the way back in the cafe.  They opened the big window.  It's open air. So they opened the whole thing on the outside. So we were kind of like rolling back  into the cafe. It's also possible that they'll do it in the Steve Jobs Theater. It's possible  that they'll put the developers out of Cafe Max and they'll have the press go to the Steve  Jobs Theater because if we're all just watching a video, they could split us up if they wanted to.  That's the mystery. We don't know anything about that, but it's going to be a small group. It'll  be more like last year than any other year, probably all pre-taped. It's a small event.  Then the developers have also been told, and this was reported, to make time on Tuesday for  something. The guess is that this headset is going to take that much time to roll out to people  because again, you can't really just put it on a table and say, everybody look. You've got to  cycle people through. So it may take days or who knows? Maybe we'll just all need Tuesday to pick

She sprang into action designing her winning Swift playground  to track a user's eye movements as they try to follow a ball moving around the screen designed  to help strengthen the eye muscles. I wonder if these are all going to be kind of, that would  sure be better if you could put a helmet on. Here's 21-year-old Yemi Agason. He is a student  at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. He designed a first-person baseball game.  I bet you all of these would look really good in a headset.  I'm sorry, Marta Michelle Caliendo, 25 years old. She's fascinated with fossils.  She's studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples. Nice. Is it Naples, Florida or Naples,  Italy? I think it's Naples, Italy. No, I don't know. Yeah, University of Naples, Federico  Duhue. Coding helps me find new ways to express and share that message with others.  Her playground is a memory game featuring anatomically, well, excuse me, I'm sorry kids,  anatomically correct pictures of dinosaur fossils.

Transcript:  Well, this is the time of year. Yeah. No, I'm kidding. Actually, we've had a good conversation.  I'm going to pause for a moment to let you gentlemen wet your whistles, if that's what  you call them. But we'll be back with other stories. There's more in the Mac and Apple world,  but first a plea, a beg, a respectful ask. This show has no ads. The ad market, and I've talked  to so many podcasters and so many big podcasting companies, is struggling, let's be honest.  And I don't know why that is. Is it recession? Is it post-COVID hangover? But companies are  not buying podcast ads like they used to. And when a show doesn't have any ads, that means it's out  of pocket for us, unless we can convince you to help out a little bit. So I know, hey, I know we're  not Jerry's kids, but $7 a month keeps the lights on, keeps the shows flowing, keeps our team employed,  keeps our hosts getting their stipends. It's a little small amount to pay, but you get a great  benefit, I think. Ad-free versions of all of our shows, plus shows we don't put out except to the  club, like Hands on Macintosh with Micah Sargent. We put out occasional episodes of that for the  public to consume on our YouTube channel, but the full set of weekly shows is only available to club  members. Same with Hands on Windows with Paul Thurotte. We brought back Scott Wilkinson's Home  Theatre Geeks, a show, again, that we really loved doing but couldn't afford to do until the club  came along. Plus great events going on in our Discord. The Discord is the best social network  ever. I've become a Discord fan and we have events in the Discord. For instance, you can join us  with the keynote in the live stream. You can watch the Home Theatre Geeks recordings. We've  got a fireside chat coming up with Floss Weekly's Sean Powers. Stacey's Book Club is really a great  book, right, John? You were really loving The Terraformers, Anna Lee Newitz's new book.  We're going to have a, it looks like booze soaked inside twit next month,  and a fireside chat with Rod Pyle. Rod Pyle's a great example of what the club hath wrought.  We wouldn't have this week in space. We launched it, so to speak, in the club because it was a  brand new show and we knew there'd be no audience yet, no advertisers yet to support it. But as it  grew in the club and it grew its audience, Tarek Malek, the editor in chief of space.com, Rod Pyle,  editor in chief of the National Space Society's publication, really do a great job. They grew the  audience, they grew the advertisers. We were able to put it out in the public and again,  that's thanks to the club. So if you are at all interested, you can find out all the pricing  details on the page. One thing though, please tell your wife if you buy it. We got a charge  back the other day because a guy subscribed to the club, I think he bought the $84 full year package,  and without telling his wife, and the wife issued a charge back, disputed it, and we had to give him  the money back. And then we got a ding from Stripe. It's become a whole hassle. So please,  don't surprise your spouse with this purchase unless it's a gift. But charge backs really  can be a problem. We don't want too many of those. So only if you know this is, I really want this.  Twitter.tv slash club Twitter. It really does help us out. Seven bucks a month,  84 bucks a year. There's family plans, discounted family plans. There's also,  it's, whoa, there's also corporate plans. We actually have quite a few corporate members,  which we thank you for that. Twitter.tv slash club. Twitter, please.

Transcript:  Apple is shutting down. I don't know if this is good or bad. I asked around. I don't know.  Apple is shutting down my photo stream. Next month, you're supposed to use iCloud  photos instead. I don't, I dimly remember this thing called my photo stream. It would allow you  to kind of up stream as many as a thousand photos, but they had to be within the last 30 days. And  they, you know, the new ones would replace the old ones. And I guess people use iCloud photos.  Anyway, Apple is going to say, tell you if you are using my photo stream that you can no longer  upload to my photo stream on June 26th, images will remain in iCloud as usual for 30 days. And  then on July, I guess July 26th, bye bye. My photo stream. Did anybody use this?

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, this was, this was their cloud photo solution for many years until they came up with  iCloud photo library, which itself was a long time ago. Now that was, that was like seven or  eight years ago. So yeah, it used to be, this was how it worked is that a rolling 30 days of your  photos were available on all your devices so that you could see them or share them or copy them  over, like copy them off your iPhone and put them on your Mac via photo stream. You could do it that  way, but that's, that's what it was. And once iCloud photo library came out and now that they've  got library sharing on top of that, but like, this is just, yeah, this is a cloud service.  Whose time has passed. Yeah. There's no functionality that you're losing by losing my

So it's not as  though if you, if you, if it's something that you thought that, oh, wow, that came out roughly when  like my second daughter was born, are there baby pictures that I haven't backed up yet?  If, if you did anything with them in photo stream, it's, it's already an iPhoto and iCloud.

I can't afford the bandwidth for iCloud.  I don't know if that makes even makes any sense. I don't think it's going to use more bandwidth,  but I guess maybe they didn't want to pay for iCloud because they don't have enough bandwidth  to use it fully. Something like that. I don't know if you don't pay for iCloud, what happens,

Transcript:  though, before the shutdown in July. Apple's $50 million butterfly keyboard settlement is finally,  finally been approved. You know, it was holding it up. So there was a class action lawsuit.  86,000 people had repairs on their butterfly keyboard. So they're in the class, they're going  to get some money. But there were a few people who said, well, this is only open to people who  paid for repairs. I just want money for having to use that thing. Just give me money because I had

Transcript:  typo I made because of that keyboard. Six objectors offered arguments saying the settlement wasn't fair  to Mac book owners who'd never repaired their failed keyboards and therefore didn't get any  cash. Or that the $125 offer to those who only had to pay for one replacement wasn't enough to  cover the cost of repairs. Remember Joanna Stern, I think had to repair her butterfly keyboard  multiple times. The judge said, no, no, it's insufficient to say you just want more money.  We all want more money. We all want it. That doesn't really narrow it down enough. So  the settlement's going to go out and the 86,000 people who filed their claims months ago,

Transcript:  This is a dopey story, but it's a story and we got to use all the ones we can get.  Apple sued by actor Brent Sexton because they wanted him to get a COVID vaccine. He said,  I can't because I've got too many platelets. As a result, they fired him from an upcoming  Apple TV series called Man Hunt. He was going to play President Andrew Johnson.  So it's kind of appropriate that he didn't want to get a vaccine. I don't think Andrew  Johnson would have wanted it. Appropriately, he's being a jerk. Yeah.  Yeah. He wouldn't have wanted it either. He had a note from a doctor, the actor's filing  disability discrimination lawsuit in Superior Court saying, you can't fire me for not taking  a vaccine that my doctor says I shouldn't get. Actually, he has too few platelets. Did I say  too many? He has too few platelets. It's easy to confuse the two. Apple apparently still said,  you got to get the vaccine. I would think the production company is probably who's at fault.  It's not Apple here, right? I mean, Apple's funding this. Alex, Apple doesn't actually  act as the production company for any of these, do they?

Start time: 4666.58
End time: 4691.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, I mean, most production companies though had a mixture. Throughout COVID,  there were a series of testing procedures and whether you were vaxxed or not. It wasn't required  except for when the production company or the owner of the production company decided that this  is the way it needs to be. So it's the production company, not Apple.  In most productions, you were getting PCRs every day when you walked in.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I will be tested. That happened almost. You get tested every day. I mean,  during the heaviest time, you would get tested every single day for PCR. And it was just,  you just walk in. But they got to a point. The first couple of productions was a little rough.  Everyone was trying to figure out what was going on. By a month or two into it, they had gotten it  sorted out and it was good money for the people who were doing it. And then you think the PCRs  were like $1.75 a piece or something like that. So that's what they were charging. It was costing  a lot less. So it was good business while it lasted. One of my former employees was a COVID

End time: 4784.11
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  get used to it. But it didn't really matter. I mean, I don't think they were really worried  about, they were worried about people getting COVID. They wanted to make sure that no one was  on set with COVID and the PCR is the most sensitive. And then within six months, we were mostly doing  antigen. It was like antigen and if you test positive on antigen, you'll get PCR tests,  but the antigen was a lot cheaper and that kind of thing. So no one cared after that.

Transcript:  The writer's strike is going to do a lot more harm to production than COVID did, I think.  How many months in? Pretty messy. How long is it going to last? There doesn't seem to be much

Transcript:  movement. It's probably going to last forever because they want things that are not possible.  So until they decide that they're not going to do the things that they're doing, they're not going  to do it. The writers, are they the producers? The writers are not. The producers aren't going  to cave on that. Alex, you're wearing your producer hat right now. I'm just saying, I'm not wearing  any hat. I'm just saying, I'm just being real. The producers aren't going to give what they're  asking because that would be suicide. And so the thing is that the writers, I'm not disagreeing  with the writers. I think that they should keep on fighting the good fight. I'll be super surprised.  They'll get something out of it. That's what a negotiation is. You start in a position and

Start time: 4840.86
End time: 4852.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  then you have something willing to give. My sense of it is that there's a few things like AI and  stuff, but really the real concern is the writer's agreement, which predates streaming, doesn't

Start time: 4852.20
End time: 4870.80
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  include sufficient compensation for streaming. Is that right? I just don't know if they're ever  going to be able to calculate. I guess the thing that I don't understand is how they're ever going  to be able to calculate royalties the way they did before. Because people only watch little bits  and pieces and it's all connected to a larger thing. And it's really hard. Also streamers are losing money

Start time: 4870.92
End time: 4881.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  like crazy. It's not like, or are they? It's funny because they're firing people and they're  canceling shows and yet they seem to be making profits. So I'm very confused. I'm not losing money,

Start time: 4881.34
End time: 4901.44
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  but I'm just saying that the problem is that the person isn't buying, they're no longer going to  that show. They're no longer going to that thing. You mean that network, that streamer. They're not  saying- No, they're no longer going to that. They're watching X number of minutes of this and I guess  you could try to figure that out. That'll unwrap into such a mess. I'm certain they could try to

Start time: 4901.62
End time: 4985.96
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  figure it out. Netflix knows. The streamers have data about all of that and I bet you they could do  it. And maybe that's the path forward here, but the bottom line is, as Andy said, all the writer  deals were basically made on a scenario where you had reruns on TV and stuff like that and that the  value was spread over time. And now a lot of times the value is only concentrated on the streamer.  And there's very little, here's the thing that people don't know. There's very little disclosure  of data, of proprietary streaming data to people on the creative side, from people on the production  side or the streamer side. And this is part of the issue is they can't, creative professionals  in Hollywood don't even have a way to judge their worth because the stats. So when you're  trying to negotiate your next deal, you don't have your deal detailing whether you were a hit at  Netflix because Netflix doesn't tell you except the barest limited amount that Netflix wants to  tell you. So that is the nut they're trying to crack. And I agree. I think a lot of this stuff  is going to fall by the wayside for them to just try to come up with a framework that means that  if you're writing for a TV show on Netflix and it does three seasons and then it's on Netflix for  another 10 years or whatever it is that you get compensated in a way that you used to, it's not  the same, but in a way that makes sense like the old rerun system made sense because that system

Start time: 4986.28
End time: 5072.96
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  is basically dead. There are a whole bunch of list of things going on. But one of them is that  it's not so much that they want more money, but their position or at least their negotiating  position is that a lot of the deals that the union agreed to are based on the fact that,  okay, we're going to accept less money upfront because you're going to be giving us a lot of  more money in the future. In addition to everything that Jason said, that what you've written is  exclusive to Netflix or Disney. They ran it for one season. Things are kind of tight. So they're  not only not picking up for a second season, but they're also dropping it off the channel.  There's no place you can buy it on physical media, no place you can buy it on iTunes or  whatever. And so now that's just simply an absolute dead source of revenue. They're also arguing about  what I found out called the mini rooms, mini writers rooms, where instead of having a team  of people who are hired for an entire development cycle to develop the entire show, the entire  the Bible and the entire first season, it's like you basically get a few people in for guess what,  you get an entire weekend to break all of the stories for this entire thing with a minimal  number of people. And so we're a very tiny amount of money and no security. So basically  they're trying to turn this into a more of a gig economy than treating writers like professionals  whose work is worth being able to basically to live and eat and that sort of stuff.

I'm not going to claim to have  knowledge I don't have, but you could absolutely make sure that when the producers get together,  they point at that and say, we must never let that happen again.

And so  the, you know, that's what, that's what we've seen in the past. So it just depends on how long the  last one was a huge boom for reality TV. It wasn't the, it started reality TV. Reality TV was a nation  market that, that was, that was the thing that they could, that could jump to. And then it took  over a big chunk of stuff. The, the, the benefactors of this right now are, are overseas productions,  creators. You know, those types of things are all things that are, are going to benefit from,  from a very long strike.

TV is really  expensive to produce for compared to, um, this is cheap.  Compared to YouTube. No, it's cheaper. I wouldn't say that it's cheap, but you're not like,  relatively I used to, I used to be on a mailing list that would send you the pitches from all the  production companies. And so you would say, Hey, we're looking for a new series for Epic  and it's got 375,000 an episode. And this is what, and that was like a low budget one, 375,000,  all in it's, it's this, it shouldn't have this kind of people that should have these kind of people.  This is the kind of thing we want. And you would get one, you get like two or three,  two or three of those a day.

It's, it's, it's, I think it's,  I didn't watch the whole thing, but it's, it's well produced. It's, it's definitely a YouTube style  production, right? You know, no actors, of course, some interviews for sure. Look at that  Geneva typeface. That's, that's history right there. And then they are, and by the way,  just, if you're one of those people sending pitches to Alex, you might want to note this  in the comments. The verge says, what other mysteries or forgotten stories should we look into?  So they, they apparently aren't getting that same mail that you are Alex.

I think that a lot of YouTubers stuff is, is now reaching a point where I consider it's  very good. Yeah. A huge chunk of what I watch is YouTube at this point. And if you look at,  you're not going to see a succession. You're not going to see a succession on YouTube.  You're not going to, it's different kind of, what it is, is different.

And it's  not, it's not going anywhere, but I think Alex is right that, that John Landgraf, who has been the  head of FX for the last few years, he's considered kind of the mayor of television. He's been  charting peak TV and we've reached it. Right. Like clearly we have reached the most television  that's ever going to be produced in a year as original scripted content and American TV.  It's over, right? It's coming down the other side. I don't think it's going to go away,  but yeah, we're not, we've, we're in a, in a contraction era now, not an inflation era.

Sometimes it's not going to go away. Like radio never went away. You know, we still, there's still  radios out there, but, but I think that the hard part is, is that if I look at the behavior of my  kids, you know, they're, they're watching a deep library. I mean, they're watching stuff that hasn't  that's 10 years old, 20 years old. And they're watching YouTube and they're playing games and  creating their own stuff. And I just don't see, and their friends, when they come over, it's all  the same. Like you just see this, like they're watching old Japanese animations and they're  watching old films. My daughter's watching Gilmore girls, you know? And so, so they're, you know,  they're all watching these old, old films in these old shows and very little interest in the newer  ones. Like we, we occasionally get into the newer ones, but it's not, and I think that's the,

But it's, yeah, she watches it, I think,  on Netflix. So it's, it's, I think that it's going to be, but I do think that there's the,  the interest in narrative is, is, you know, it's just hard to write. Here's what I would say is  there's a lot of great writers that are way better than anything that I would ever do.  It's just hard to write good stuff on a consistent basis. And I think that it's expensive.  Well, it's expensive and it's also just really hard to come up with a story. And, you know,  and I think that somebody like Jesse Armstrong is expensive. I would imagine. And I find myself,  you know, I was noticing it yesterday. I was just noticing how I there's a lot, there's a lot of  crutches that are used when you're doing a lot of narrative. And, and I think I, maybe it's only  because I know, know what they are. But I sit there and just go, Oh, really? Yes. Cheesy.

Transcript:  That's how you're going to do that. 90% of everything is garbage. I would say that I think  that at peak TV, we did end up with more good TV as well as that TV. I think that it does scale.  And I think what we saw is that when they had to look in the couch cushions to find creators who  otherwise didn't get, wouldn't get their show green lit, some of those shows were brilliant.  And some of them were awful. And that's just how it goes. Those, there will be fewer opportunities  for that. But I mean, my daughter and my son both are, you know, they, they are not both born in  the 21st century, right? They are not, not interested in scripted TV. They are absolutely.  They use Netflix. They, my son is always asking me for like the HBO Max password and all of those  things, right? That it's just mixed in with a whole bunch of other stuff, which is Alex's point.  It's part of a, when we were kids, it was just TV and occasionally a movie on the weekend. And now  TV's not going to go away. Movies aren't going to go away, but they do have to fight with video  games and YouTube and podcasts and who knows what else. And I think that one of the things that,

Transcript:  I remember having a conversation about copyright when I was working at Sony, this is a long time  ago about why, you know, why are we having copyright lasts for so long? It was a discussion.  And they said, well, if copyright, if everything was available to everyone all the time and people  could just keep on building on the past, they wouldn't listen to the present. And, and it was  just an interesting thing that I didn't really understand 30 years ago when I was having the  conversation, but it makes more sense now is that when all of this content is available all at the  same time, it used to be when we watched TV, it was just the stuff that came out that was new,  that was there. And there was all this new stuff. But the problem now is, is that everything for the  last 50 years is on, on something somewhere that we're not paying very much for. And, you know,  I think that again, you can fall into some really good written stuff that's from the seventies and  the eighties and the nineties. And, and I think that that is a, I think that's, that's has a lot  of downward pressure on new narrative, which I think people are having trouble turning over,

You know, I just, I just  rediscovered a Pritzzee's honor, like that Jack Nicholson movie from 1985, which I'd completely,  I didn't see at the time because I was a teenager and I'd completely forgotten about, but it just  came back to my attention and like, it's a great movie and it's better than like most of the movies  I've seen like with the past year or two. And it's, that's realized that the, the, the,  the transformative thing about copyright is that it's supposed to encourage the distribution of  content, not limited. That's the idea that this is why it's just so frustrating that so many  media companies have gotten so many extensions to copyright. And then so-

Transcript:  But that's, but that's, that's, that's also part of the problem. Like as I was saying earlier,  now you have a series that are brilliant series, but the Netflix, again, never makes it available  to iTunes or the Play Store, never releases it on physical media. And so when they take it off of  their streaming service, it simply disappears forever. And that actually there's, there's  always been sort of a gray area where I don't, I don't support piracy, but there are some areas  in which if the alternative is that this story dies, that I, I think that the person who is,  who is capturing that stream and posting it in places where it can be safe for future generations  isn't doing something that's a hundred percent bad. So it's, it, it, it, as, as I'm, as I'm fond  of saying, so many of these questions only get to come up. Like now that we have technology that can  actually preserve, make it easy to make a 1974 mid range made for TV movie available to everybody  everywhere all at once at no cost. That's not a question we had to answer before, but now that it  is, it's like, okay, have you abandoned this property because you clearly don't care about it.  Can you now basically just like, if you don't take care of a, of a piece of real estate for X  number of years is considered abandoned. And the person who is more than the law and the person  who is like putting out the fires there, they can say, well, guess what? This belongs to me now or

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, Apple labels it as a season finale. And there was always, they, they shifted gears about  a year ago and stopped talking about it being a three season show and started talking about how  the plan for the original story ends after three seasons, which is a quite a hedge, right? Of like,  well, they might maybe do something more, but the truth is, and you see this art imitating life and  life imitating art, Jason Sudeikis during the shooting of the first season, I believe got a  divorce. He's got kids there back in the U S he's in the UK for seven months shooting Ted Lasso.  And you can see that I think this is not a spoiler. This is speculation. It sure feels like Ted Lasso  was very sad about being away from his kid. And it wouldn't surprise me if the resolution of the  show is that he goes back home and that would be direct with Jason Sudeikis, who I think just does  not want to be in the UK. There have been some reports about that. That said, the proverbial  truck of money Apple will back up to anybody's house to keep the Ted Lasso magic going. I want  one of the reasons they haven't announced anything. And maybe now the writer's strike will,  we'll change this a little bit too. But I always assume that the resolution of Ted Lasso would,  would then lead to the question of, would there be more Ted Lasso? Would there be a spin off?  What would happen next? And I was always expecting that Apple would make an announcement like  the week after the last episode of Ted Lasso, or maybe the Monday after about those spin-offs  and all that. Like, can they, can they back up some money to...  Wouldn't that be a good time to do that? Yeah.  Right. But it may not be the end of Ted Lasso. It may be that Ted Lasso becomes a different show,  or it may follow Ted back to the States and, and somebody else does a show with AFC Richmond and  they keep going, or maybe it's the end. But again, I, I given that it is Apple's by far highest  visibility thing on Apple TV plus, and they are the company with the most cash of anyone in the  tens of billions, like $50 billion in cash. Hard to imagine that we've seen the last of these

I don't know how old it is. It might  have been really old, but he said he got offered $150 million to do another, just one more season  of Seinfeld. And he was just like, no, no, he wanted to leave it the where it was. Like he's  like, I want to leave it when it's at the top. He has so much money. He doesn't need it. He did

Start time: 6330.20

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  mean, I'm sorry. It's very much, it is the most ensemble of ensemble shows. If there's any show  that could get away with it, staying in England without Ted Lasso himself, I think maybe that show  could do it because they have like 15 other characters they could follow. Too many, if you  ask me. Or do you follow Jason back to the States? Or why not both? If you're Apple and you've got  40 billion in cash. But I appreciate what Alex is saying. There are real creative issues here too.  And I think the fascinating thing to watch is what happens when you've got a company with all the  money who basically says to a bunch of creative people, would you like all the money and what the  creative people do? Because I think the beauty of it is if you're Jerry Seinfeld and you can say,  you know what? I'm done. This is it. And maybe that's the answer there. I'll point out Brett  Goldstein, who is Roy Kent. He is the co-executive producer and creator of a different Apple TV show,  Shrinking with Jason, another Jason, Jason Segal and Harrison Ford. And that's a great show. And  that's already like, Brett Goldstein already has another gig there as a writer. So like, in some  ways, the money truck has already backed up to his house. But I'm just saying, I wonder about the  push and pull of art and commerce and whether those producers feel that there's more there.  And it's not always about one person, right? Like Jason Sudeikis might say, I'm over it. But it's  literally all the actors he's been working with, all the writers he's been working with, the crew  that he put together for this show. And you do see that sometimes where the star is like really  reluctant to have the 50 other people he's working with for the last three years lose their jobs  because he wants to be done. Does he not own the IP? Didn't he create the character or no?

But when they  sold it to NBC, essentially, they sold that concept him and Brendan Hunt. And so then NBC  licenses it to Warner Brothers, who puts it on Apple. It's a whole, everybody, look, everybody  wants to make more money here, except maybe Jason Sudeikis. Apple is billing it. I'm looking as the

And then they go, well, let's see if we can sell it. You know, like we're not going to put it on  our own. Like Fox, Fox developed the waking or the, the waking dead. Is that right?  Walking, walking, walking dead. The walking dead. They do wake up, but they're only walking.  It's the walking dead. And boy, they developed it. And they were like, I don't know if we can  sell this.

And that we'll have, we'll have a storyline for Ted that requires a lot of green screen work and  a lot of this office work and a lot of other characters, other actors flying to view. But  if we can get you into, into at least five or six episodes out of the season,  not wrong. Oh, I can still see your eyebrows. Let me put some more money on the stack.

And so they would interact with their double and we just made sure they didn't overlap,  you know, like their hands or whatever. It was these scenes, all the, over the shoulders were  over with the double. We had one where they were both in Santa Monica, neither of them were in  Santa Monica. And, and so, and like we shot literally, we shot them two weeks apart from each other  in Japan and then put them into Santa Monica and had them talking back and forth.

And when we  come back, your picks of the week, my friends, as Mac break weekly continues a reminder, we will be  here on Monday, 10 AM Pacific to 1 PM Eastern time, 1700 UTC to cover the Apple live stream  from WWDC. And we're all very excited to see what will transpire there. I'll be joined by  Micah Sargent right here at this table. So tune in on Monday and then next Tuesday, we'll be back  with Mac break weekly. Jason won't be here, but we'll, we'll be able to talk about, I guess,  whatever it is they announced. Alex Lindsay, your picks of the week.

Transcript:  So we had this company on, about, about on office hours, I think last, not last week,  but the week before is called. And they make a program called phase plant and now phase,  it's, it's not phase plant. It's a great name. It's a company called Kilo hearts. And they're out of,  they're out of, out of Sweden. So of course it's, it's part of the Swedish audio music, you know,  mafia, I think. But, but the, it is, it is just one of the most amazing pieces of software that  I've seen. I mean, it's just like for audio, it's audio, but what it is, is a generator and it gives  you almost unlimited ability to tie. So they were building all these plugins for the last decade.  And they, this plugin does this and this does modulation and this doesn't affect,  but you can tie any output to almost any input. So you can say, attenuate this with this and tie  this into this. And you can create a, you know, this, this applies to, you know, and you can keep  on stacking these pieces up and then just tie in, just looping them all together to build really  complex, you know, sounds. It can be music. It can be the sound effects that what got me to bring them  onto our, onto office hours was they, someone put up something on Twitter where they had a helicopter  take off. Like literally it sounds like a helicopter starting up and taking off. And they were doing it  all inside the synthesizer. And it's almost like I got to have these guys on. And so, so we brought  them on, really great demo. And, and it's just a really, it's, it, it basically you can build  almost anything inside of it. And they've got some great examples. It's not very expensive, $199 for  the buyout, or you can pay 10 bucks a month. So they give you both options. And the interesting  thing is, is that the, when you, I really like this business model. If you, it's kind of like a buy,  a rent to buy. So if you, if you do the membership, you actually get, you're building up the ability  to buy it from them, you know, so if you, if you keep using it and you get more features and so on  so forth. Anyway, I think it's a, it's a really cool app. It's definitely worth checking out.

Start time: 6884.10
End time: 6965.65
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Eventually it costs like some little amount to turn it over or something like that. And so it's,  you get more features if you, if you, if you rent it actually, but if you buy it, you can buy it. So  some people want to own it outright. Especially if you just know how to use the app, but they have  tons and tons of samples where, where people that they've worked with, they've either commissioned  it or they've gotten them from them or the people that built them there. And they call those the  content banks. Yeah. Content banks. And it's just, but it'll be a whole thing that's been built for  you to kind of dig through, like how did they do this? I don't understand what happened here. And,  and, and the, the stuff is really, you know, it's really complex. I mean, this is a,  um,  Is this for musicians? For both filmmakers?  I think it's for people who do sound effects. There's a lot of sound effects stuff you could do,  but there's a ton of like a lot of, um, electronica I think was, is more, it's probably  less of a, um, uh, less of a device for someone who wants to do acoustic, of course.  It's more EDM focused.  EDM. Yeah. More, more EDM stuff as well, but it's, um,  but you can, but you can tie those all back to keyboards and, you know, a lot of other things,  but you're building all of those things from scratch, you know, all these sounds.  And, uh, and it's just a, it's, I, I'm still kind of, there's, I don't, I,  I don't get that many apps where I just go, holy smokes, like this breaks, this hurts my head  thinking about it.  So there's, it's just kind of a, uh, endless synthesizer.

Transcript:  Uh, I love my playdate by panic, like that little handheld, like I'm still still using  it all the time. It hasn't stayed in the drawer. One of my favorite games, probably my absolute  favorite game for it has just been ported over for the iPhone. It's game called, it's a puzzle  game called generations and it is exactly my kind of game. It's a, it's an interesting sort of,  interesting sort of mechanic where you have this wall in which you were supposed to hang like  photos of your family. And it's a, when you match three of them, it's basically each generation of  babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, adults, uh, and, uh, and elderly people. And when you have  three of these pictures of the same generation together, they collapse to form like the next  generation. So when you get three Todd, three infants in a row, they like merge together and  become one picture of a toddler. Uh, and so, uh, you have a limited number of space. And so what I  love about it is that it's not one of those endless like match three puzzles, not, it isn't  like anything like a match three puzzles you've probably seen. It's a, it's, it ends because  there's a limited number of wall space. Once the, once you filled the last square, you're done,  the game is over. You get a scroll, you get a score. So it's not like one of those things where  you wind up getting in this sort of mental fugue state of dopamine and it's three hours later and  you've done nothing and you're really not happy about it. Uh, it's fun. It's really is mentally  engaging. There are no ads, there are no in-app purchases, no nothing. It's five bucks and you  own it. Uh, and it is, it's my perfect, like five, 10, 15, 20 minutes of diversion while waiting for  a bus or something. I love it. Just bought it. Scenic roots or route. Where do they say route?

Transcript:  I went McConaughey there. I don't know what happened. Okay. Eventually all roads lead to  McConaughey. Disclaimer here. This is a former sponsor of Six Colors, but it doesn't matter  because I love them and they're not paying me to say this. And we love them too. And they never  sponsored a thing on our network. So there. Audio Hijack from Rogue Amoeba version 4.2 came out this  week. It is the ultimate Mac sound recording and routing tool. I use it for all of my podcasts.  They added a wonderful new feature this week, which is a recording block that does speech denoise. So  if you're doing something and you want to just sort of pull the noise out, it will do that  automatically for you. And just more broadly, this is just an excuse to talk about Audio Hijack.  It is so amazing what it can do. It will record from individual apps. It will route them.  You can route recordings from different apps together and microphones and route them to new  outputs and inputs and live streams. And you can stream to YouTube. You can stream to IceCast,  which is what I do for a lot of my podcast streams. It will, it's just, it'll do anything you want.  It's an easy sort of drag and drop interface. It's got a huge stack of effects that you can  put on things you can record. For example, for podcasts, I'll record my audio and the  audio I'm getting on Zoom. Plus I'll route them into a single file that's a low bit rate MP3 that  I can post to my members on my podcast network. And all happens with one button. Once I set that  up button, once you set that up, you just press the button and it does all of those things.  It's recording multiple streams in different file encodings. It can do, you know, take things  down to mono or EQ them or like anything you want to do. I do not go a day without using  Audio Hijack. And if you do audio on your Mac, it is well worth it. And then today's update  just adds like a handful more. There's a parametric EQ. There's the voice denoise that uses machine  learning to do the denoising on the fly. There's always more stuff in there. It's really remarkable  and all in it. What I think is actually a very intuitive user interface because it's all these  little squares that are connected to other little squares that go where you want them to go.

Start time: 7389.04
End time: 7461.56
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  It's a beautiful, beautiful app. And as you're talking, the audio actually pulses in the little  lines you've connected between the two. So you know that there's audio going through that little  circuit you've made. What I love about it is that it's one of those great values in software where  there are a lot of apps that are just, hey, look, you can record stuff off of Safari or hey,  you can record between two microphones or USB. This is no matter what you want to record in  whatever situation, you can do it and it's easy to figure out. When I'm normally recording my  Google Podcast, it's usually I have to record my local audio. I have to record backup audio of both  our combined conversation with my partner and in a backup of my partner's conversation in case her  in case her audio goes bad. And so that was easy to put together. And then when then was like,  oh, actually a couple of weeks ago, I needed to I wanted to play some audio from a web browser  as we're having this conversation. And it's very easy. Okay, just drop in this as a source,  add the pipeline here so that now it goes to this recording. But not so I'm recording like four  things at the same time, but each of them is different parts combined together. And what I'm  saying is that no matter what you want to do, you can have a it will give you a solution to it. It's

Start time: 7461.70
End time: 7509.52
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  that flexible. Yeah, in fact, one of my favorite uses of it is in a multi microphone recording,  you don't always have like great confidence in like I've got a interface with four microphones  attached to it. But like, I want all the recording separate. I did this back at IDG, we set up our  podcast studio and I wanted to create a big red button people could push button in order to record  all the microphones and I didn't want them to have to say file names. I didn't want to add inputs  into logic or garage band. I didn't want any of that. I literally wanted them to have a button  to push. And that was an audio hijack session that just had each of the microphones that was  in the studio recording to a file that was saving to the right place. And it didn't matter if you  had two people or three people or four people, it would just record everything and you could sort it  out later. And like that's the power and simplicity of something like audio hijack.

Transcript:  And the only warning I have is that you're going to go to buy it and you're going to see it by  itself. Then you see it bundled with loopback. Just buy the bundle. You should buy it. Yeah,

Start time: 7521.32
End time: 7570.48
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  you're right. Loopback is the other part of this, which is it creates virtual inputs and  outputs on your Mac. And with those two things, everything I do is possible with live streaming  and all of that because that's the missing piece in audio hijack is loopback. I have this actually,  here's a Discord thing that I do. I stream a podcast that I do for Six Colors members to  Discord. And we were like really frustrated with how audio stages work in Discord. And I realized  all I need to do is set my microphone in Discord to be loopback and have audio hijacks output of  our conversation that I'm recording to post later also go to loopback. And that's it. At that point,  both of our voices just go into there. Dan Moran doesn't need to connect to Discord and get his  microphone input right. We just forget it. Just use loopback and audio hijack and they work well

I mean, these are apps that you  have to own if you're doing podcasting, audio, that type of thing. If you're doing it by yourself,  if you have big production, you might have a bunch of hardware, but if you're doing what we do,

So that's, you know,  although I do note that on their page is thanks MacBreak Weekly for saying it is the,  one of the greatest Mac apps ever, highest recommendation, one of the greatest pieces  of Mac software that's ever been written. That sounds like Andy maybe saying that. I don't know.  Anyway, version 4.2- I don't hide my love under a bushel.  No, you don't version 4.2 is out audio hijack from rogue amoeba. Everyone agrees it's the best.  And you know, if we had audio hijack running right now, we could remove the sound of that jack hammer
