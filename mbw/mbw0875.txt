[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.960]   I'm going to introduce our special guest in a moment.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   But first, let's say hello to Alex Lindsey from Office Hours and zero.net.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.280]   Zero.media. Hello, Alex.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760]   The man with the best shot in the world.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   The most beautiful.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.600]   Your background is getting richer and more beautiful all the time.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.960]   It's mostly just junk back there.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   The best thing is you're short depth of field.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   So you can't see that I'm just throwing junk on the show.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.600]   Fuzzy junk.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   That's the key.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.960]   It's back there.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.920]   Blurry junk.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.480]   Or do what Andy and I could does.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.760]   Just get a show G screen.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.480]   No one will know.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.760]   There you go.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.320]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.880]   Yeah, who's how messy is my office back there?
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.600]   No one else.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.200]   You're not going to find out from there.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.880]   What I like about Alex is that you're getting the vibe of like a late 1980s,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.440]   early 1990s cable news channel sort of thing where this just,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.640]   oh, look how busy we got so many busy things in our newsroom.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.080]   It's dimly lit.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.760]   But you can see by the number of screens that we're not doing this on the cheap.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.320]   We've hired lots of people really honestly.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.480]   It's we're watching lots of television to get you the intern wanders through then.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.080]   Oh, I'm on camera and ducks out.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.720]   It's mostly full of things that used to be worth a lot of money.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.280]   Like they're almost exactly what they have.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   It's the wall of depreciation.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.120]   So yeah, things that used to be the wall of depreciation.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.680]   Look upon my works and despair says this $10,000 workstation.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.920]   I mean, this camera, this camera right here was $4 million.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.680]   This camera right here was $60,000.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.280]   And they're all worth like hundreds now.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.320]   You're the Asmandias of PCs.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.960]   Now let's say hello.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.360]   Jason Stelz got the week off because as he mentioned last week,
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.440]   we're so proud of him and his daughters graduating from college.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.560]   And he's there up there doing that.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.720]   But we took this as an opportunity.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.280]   Great.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.920]   James Thompson on for a peak house fame.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.560]   Hi, James.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.600]   Hi.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.840]   I'm always pleased to shift the average age down a bit for the show.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.040]   That's a lot.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.160]   You're great too, dude.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.240]   Don't don't be blowing any horns.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.400]   James is legendary as when did you first start developing for?
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.600]   Was it Mac?
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.120]   Did you start with our iOS that you started?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.240]   Yeah, I started Mac, the first peak house shit in December '92.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.280]   So it's well over 30 years old at this point.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.160]   So that should give you a baseline for how old I am.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.680]   Yeah, I'm only actually, I'm only two years younger than Jason.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.160]   So yeah, I can't actually throw many.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.360]   So you did shift it down though.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.080]   That's good.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.560]   That's good.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.640]   I mean, mathematically, yes.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.440]   You know, spiritually emotional.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.320]   No, no, you got you got you got you got to leverage that.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.800]   Like my like I have like I have older sisters and like I'm only like two years younger
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.320]   than like the next youngest one.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.960]   But according to like Time Magazine or whatever,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.720]   she's technically a baby boomer and I'm technically Generation X.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.640]   So I'm so you boomers.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.680]   You just I can't be fixing your phone all the time.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.920]   Okay.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.040]   I can't keep explaining to you how America Online works.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.600]   Switch.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.440]   I have to ask James if your breath caught as many of us did during Apple's event a couple
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.600]   of weeks ago when they said, and finally we're releasing an app we should have released long
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:03.160]   ago for the iPad and everybody literally I genuinely I held my breath for the like couple
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.960]   of seconds.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.120]   I mean, like I I actually I think I posted to Master Dawn earlier in the day.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.200]   I said like I will be genuinely surprised if they don't release a calculator these days because
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.480]   it's such low hanging through and they get such stick for it.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.840]   But no, they didn't.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   So it was health and but we were all thinking calculator.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   We thought, I mean, I mean, I just gonna get Sherlock, but you wouldn't get Sherlock
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.160]   because yours is so much superior than anything Apple would do.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.320]   Well, I mean, I think the thing is like the platforms that we sell the most on is phone and
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.240]   back where there's a calculator already.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.920]   So it doesn't actually matter.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.800]   They shipped a calculator on the watch even.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.560]   Yeah, I was actually I had a bet with somebody that they would ship a calculator on the
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.120]   headset before they shipped it on the iPad, but seems like they're not doing that.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.040]   Vision Pro calculator.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.240]   You just look at a number and and it adds it in.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.040]   I mean, you want to be surrounded by your numbers really.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.840]   That's it.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.720]   3d numbers.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.000]   Well, anyway, we're glad you didn't get Sherlock.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.080]   And I think that's actually I'm going to interpret it as a little tip of the hat to you
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.440]   that we don't need to do a calculator on the iPad because there is the best calculator ever already.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.800]   There.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   I think that most of Apple product marketing has no idea who I have.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.040]   And the people who do know who I am don't think of me fondly.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.400]   Oh, no, that's not that Apple.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.880]   You mean?
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.720]   Well, I know that feeling good Lord.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.000]   I was once I once talked to Craig Federico, a WWDC.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.600]   And I was sort of giving him the background on myself.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.160]   And I started to say who I was and just sort of tell some anecdote.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.560]   And he looked at me and he said, I've heard you tell that story on a podcast.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.520]   And I thought, oh, wow.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   The only podcast that I have told that on was debug, where I said a lot of fairly
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.920]   negative things about my time at Apple.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.160]   So.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   Oh, dear.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.720]   Oh, dear.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.800]   That was a very interesting backhanded way of saying, I know you.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:16.760]   I mean, if we get on to talking about widgets, that was certainly something that I was known for.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.480]   Nine years ago, I said, good.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.680]   We will talk about widgets.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.600]   We'll talk about everything because I wanted to bring, I said to John,
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.400]   I'm a producer.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   It would be great to get a developer on and get their take on everything that happened at WWDC.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.960]   You're the perfect.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   Person for it.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.000]   I guess I should ask you first, what do you think of the Vision Pro?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.160]   I mean, are you going to do P-Calc for the Vision Pro?
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.760]   I mean, yes.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.840]   You'll do dice for sure because dice actually makes sense.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.440]   Like, so I was playing as many people know, the P-Calc about screen kind of went a bit
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.320]   bizarre because 3D game and all that sort of stuff.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.000]   And all that was, I started it because I wanted to learn about 3D graphics because there were
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.480]   rumors like six years ago, seven years ago about the headset.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.680]   So I wanted to have an idea about 3D graphics.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   And so, yeah, I mean, as it stands, if I do nothing, the Apple still run on the Vision Pro
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.440]   because it will run iPad apps.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:28.360]   But it seems like there isn't actually, to get it running as a native Vision Pro app,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.040]   there's not much work I need to do.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.880]   I actually did most of the work last year.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:41.400]   I think with P-Calc, the thing that I think about when they showed it off was like,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:49.000]   one of the first apps they showed off was Microsoft Office, which is like the least kind of
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.720]   whiz-bang 3D thing that they could have led with.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.640]   And I think what they were saying there is like any app that you would want on your computer or
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.960]   your iPad or your phone or whatever is the kind of app you want to have on this device.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.080]   And so, yeah, I mean, I'll do P-Calc for it.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.560]   But as you say, dice, I've even got an AR mode in that already.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.520]   And I haven't tried it, but maybe that actually even does something already on the Vision Pro
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.440]   when you launch it in AR mode.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.960]   How close was your guess since you developed this before it came out?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.280]   As to what the API, the SDK would look like.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:35.640]   I'm actually, my guess was that they were going to cut off all the old technologies.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.760]   And they were going to say, no UI kit, things like that.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.560]   They were going to say Swift UI only for the whole thing.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.760]   And they didn't actually do that.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.520]   What they said was, you can use UI kit, but we will judge you for doing so.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.480]   And some things might not work quite as well, but the stuff is there and it will work.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.240]   The only API that didn't really make the cut was CinKit, which is actually what I used for
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.400]   the 3D stuff initially with P-Calc's about and with dice.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.160]   That can't display 3D content.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.360]   Like it can display it flat in a window, but that doesn't work.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.960]   They actually brought across more than I thought they would.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.320]   And I'm sure they will cut that off pretty soon.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.120]   But it means like, because if you're getting iPad apps existing once over,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.760]   they needed to have most of that stuff there anyway in terms of UI kit and things.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.280]   So yeah, I mean, I was pleasantly surprised by that.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.480]   I was quite surprised by the price.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.160]   Higher than you thought.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   Higher than you thought.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.480]   Higher than you thought.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.760]   Or lower, I'm going to guess higher.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:50.360]   But higher, because when there was the rumors saying, "Oh, it's going to be $3,000 that
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.080]   were floating around beforehand." And everybody was saying, "Yeah, this is just going to be like
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:01.720]   the iPad again where we all think it's going to be $3,000, but then they come out and say,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.360]   "It's $2,000." And we go, "Wow, that's so cheap."
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.840]   Wouldn't be cheap.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.520]   And so when they said three and a half, I audibly swore, I will not look at what I said.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.560]   I mean, I understand it.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.000]   You know, I totally understand.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.720]   This is not a device that anyone is actually really intended to buy.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.920]   This is-
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.400]   Well, you are.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.840]   I should point out.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.320]   Yeah, I am.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.680]   Yeah, I will.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.880]   And I suppose we are.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.160]   Yeah, I think it's like it's the first-
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.360]   It's the first device.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.280]   So people like me can make stuff.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.920]   People like you can write about it and experience it.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.440]   And some rich tech bros will buy it as well.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.840]   And there's your 100,000 a quarter right there.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.040]   100,000 years ago.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.240]   And we'll see how it goes, because five years from now, 10 years from now,
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.000]   that I think is the product that people will be buying.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.840]   I don't think this is like the iPad, where they want to get this into as many hands as possible.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.280]   And so it's price accorded.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:16.360]   This is like we are going to build the absolute best thing with no compromises whatsoever
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.720]   to show what can be done.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:25.480]   And then we'll get down to actually selling it to regular human beings at some point in the future.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.600]   But so another thing that I should say, not wishing to monopolize the conversation,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.640]   I'm having problems with my eyes and I have done for the last year.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.400]   Basically chronic dry eye stuff.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.960]   So I find it difficult to look at screens for a long time.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.560]   I have no idea whatsoever if strapping one of these things to my face is going to be better or worse
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.920]   than looking at an old screen.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.200]   My guess is it's going to be much worse.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.640]   So I come to this with the unusual, like I want to develop apps for this.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.400]   I have no idea if I'll be able to use it.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.600]   Interesting.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:11.480]   That is a kind of, you know, if this is the future of computing truly,
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.560]   if I can't use it, then well, I guess I retire.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   We'll see.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:27.000]   Oh, also I have no idea how this thing works in terms of glasses.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.920]   Like what specifically, where is the focal point of this thing when you're looking through it?
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.400]   Because I haven't heard a specific answer to that.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:42.600]   Because like all the, like I'll kill, I've got many VR headsets, too many, my wife may say.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:49.080]   I've got like the quest and PlayStation VR 2, all these things.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.840]   And most of them, the focal point for that is kind of like two meters plus away.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.440]   So it's, if you need glasses for distance, then you need that as your prescription to look at the
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.840]   thing.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.560]   But even if you're looking at something up close in the headset, it's still got the focal point
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:12.280]   of far away because these things won't shift focus as you change your, as you look at things.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.880]   So I need glasses for computer screens, which are like up to a meter away.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.400]   And I don't need glasses for stuff that's two plus meters away.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.200]   So I don't know if I'm going to need to get glasses for how it's going to work.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.480]   So there's a lot of unanswered questions, but I really want to try it.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.800]   Right.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:40.200]   But I was not flown out by Tim Cook to try my dice app on it, sadly.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.240]   I should have started by asking you how the burnouts going because I have to say,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.920]   when you posted that blog post almost two years ago now, I was like, oh my God, James,
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.680]   we had no idea.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:02.040]   I mean, like, I think I sort of passed through the burnout and I got to a place,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.480]   particularly when my eyes were giving me the most trouble.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:15.560]   And I was like, I've reached a more zen position of like, I'm going to do,
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.520]   I'm going to do what entertains me and makes me happy.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.040]   And I'm not going to sort of like push myself.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.200]   Had to lead to good.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.040]   I mean, like, I say this, and I said this the last couple of years, like, I'm not going to
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.680]   push myself to have everything ready on day one and to ship with this device on day one or to do
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.080]   this on day one. I have done it every single time.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.360]   But, you know, I'm at least starting to think famous for that, actually, like,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.400]   we know that's the thing.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.560]   Well, let's see if James has it when it ships and always you do.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:55.480]   And I mean, the thing with peak elk specifically is the core code of peak elk,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   like the actual brain of it is super portable.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.880]   Of course.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.680]   And it's very small.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.080]   It's just mad.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:08.920]   I can stuff that anywhere and all it needs is like button presses in and text out.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.840]   So that is very easy to put in places.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.440]   So when it's something like, you know, if we can't talk about widgets or even this thing,
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.160]   it's not super hard to put stuff on and to have something there.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.240]   But yeah, it will be, you know, if you see me
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.320]   working way too hard to get something out for day one for this head,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.760]   say you can tell me to slow down.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.480]   Okay.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.120]   Good.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.520]   I hope you will tell yourself to slow down your family.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.760]   Well, I'll tell you slow down, James.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.120]   It's not it's okay.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.400]   I will tell you this right now.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.640]   If you don't get it out, the day iOS 17 ships will be okay with that.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.280]   It's fine.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.880]   I know.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.120]   I know people well, but it's just that self-imposed.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.720]   That's what it is, of course.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.680]   Speaking of burnout, Mr. Alex Lindsey, you should probably listen to what James is saying,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.080]   Alex.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.320]   I don't know.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   Alex is working every moment of his waking life, which is about 18, 19, 20 hours a day, I think.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.120]   You know, I pace myself better now.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.320]   I just don't travel as much.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.680]   I think that's the big thing is that I that I was doing.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.480]   The travel was what was really nailing me.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.120]   And now that I'm pretty resistant to it,
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.560]   yeah, I spoke it.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.640]   I spoke at Infocum last week without actually
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.360]   going because we're all coming.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.360]   You just assume now everybody knows.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.240]   And I would think James, you wrote that blog post in the middle of the pandemic.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.320]   I would think the pandemic actually might have made it worse because you've always been,
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.920]   you know, homebound in a way.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.160]   I mean, right.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.920]   But I can't actually leave the house.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.640]   I want to point out.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:47.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.120]   No, but you know, I have you don't have an office to go to or do you?
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.640]   No.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.040]   I mean, like this, this is the spare bedroom in our price and it's
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.440]   we I've been here 23 years in this very room cranking out code.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:11.480]   So hence why you can see on the shelves behind me things like original halo in its box.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.960]   I thought I saw that, but then I thought, oh, must be dreaming.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.240]   That's that's.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.000]   No, it's like looking behind me.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.160]   I can see halo, some Star Wars games, some like.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.720]   You'll be vampires.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.640]   It's just because I haven't cleaned the shelves up.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.280]   That's it.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.080]   Well, that's pretty tidy.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.200]   Look, they look good.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.840]   It's not quite as curated as some of the other people, shall we say, on the show?
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.440]   Sometimes you put it in color order.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.480]   You could do that maybe.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   I think that's a little weird personally.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.640]   Actually, I think about losing your eyesight as for coder.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.520]   That's got to be the worst possible outcome for me losing my hearing.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   And as my hearing deteriorates, and I realize it's, you know, your life,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.760]   your your life work is at risk.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.240]   So that's I understand that's scary.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:18:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.920]   I mean, I like I'm not losing my sight as such.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   Like, at least currently, you know, it's just I've I'm limited in the time that I can look at
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   computer screens and phones.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.720]   So I have to kind of choose that carefully, which might be a good thing.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.960]   No, I mean, I think it is a good thing.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.360]   And I've actually one of the things that came out of this is I started to read books again,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.960]   which is something that I kind of fell off for 20 years.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.480]   And I'm now way back into it.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.120]   Oh, good.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:32.440]   And it is like, I thought my attention span had permanently atrophied to the point that I
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.960]   can sit and read about.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.000]   But apparently I can't.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.280]   So, you know, like, I'm not I'm okay.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.400]   You know, I, but it but it is the worst point certainly in the last year,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.280]   where I was, you know, genuinely thinking, you know, I got my my max loaded max studio.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.480]   I ordered it.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.560]   And then by the time it arrived, I was starting to have like first symptoms of stuff.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.280]   And I was thinking, why did I order this, you know, like 5,000 pound computer?
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.040]   I don't even know if we'll be able to use the thing.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.520]   And when he says pounds, I just for our American audience, it's not weight.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.160]   No, I mean, those things are pretty heavy, but not that heavy.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:18.840]   I bought, I bought the new MacBook Pro and I thought I'd bring it in for a show and not
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.720]   MacBook Pro, MacBook Air for show and tell the 15 inch.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:28.040]   And you know, I'm sad because it's unfortunate, but on Mastodon, Stammi,
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.440]   Paul Stattemai said, well, because I was saying how nice I thought the screen was.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:38.360]   And he said, well, how does that compare to the the of what do they call them, the XDK screens
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:46.440]   on the MacBook Pro, which my wife has a MacBook M2 MacBook Pro max with 64 gigs of RAM 14 inch.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.640]   So I put them side by side.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.000]   And now I don't like it anymore.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.080]   I want my I want the MacBook Pro.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.040]   I'm like, oh, man, it really is crisp and nice and beautiful.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:03.000]   So that is like the one time I got bumped up to first class on a flight and that just ruined
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.760]   air travel for the rest of my life.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:11.880]   Because you had a mat where why I got just I was well, I don't know.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.800]   I was flying on Apple's dime.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.680]   Maybe there's a flag that says a possible Apple VIP, not really.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.200]   Oh, I'll never forget going to a lounge.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.280]   I think we're flying to England.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.880]   And I was it.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.320]   I don't remember which lounge it was.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.440]   Maybe the British Airways lounge and Johnny I've was going to be in the lounge.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:41.320]   And they had roped off an area with a velvet rope and they had and they had balloons and they had
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.480]   his welcome Sir Johnny.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.200]   I mean, it was VIP central.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.240]   It was bizarre.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   And everybody's trying to sneak a peak of Sir Johnny and his private lounge.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.000]   You're telling me that you don't get balloons?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.600]   No, no, I don't get balloons.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.400]   I don't get nothing.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.440]   I'm sad.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.520]   I do remember that day because I couldn't find my ticket.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.760]   I just got evast on in too many pockets.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.240]   Where is it? I know it's in here somewhere.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.120]   I finally did find it.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.440]   So Johnny, I just saw this quite distressed person in the corner.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.160]   Yeah, wearing a safari jacket thinking, oh, I don't want it.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.800]   And instantly, to instantly text to Steve, say, what if we could put boarding passes
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.400]   direct on a handheld device?
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   I am never doing this again.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.040]   It's because of me.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.320]   All right.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.280]   I would like to very much talk about the new operating systems.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.920]   But please, I don't want to leave Andy and Alex out.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.440]   So please guys, jump in.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.040]   I'm sure you have questions for James.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.400]   I know you know James probably better than I do.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.800]   I don't want to make this all on James's poor shoulders.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.360]   No, I'm not going to not going to put too much of a burden on his shoulders.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.600]   But this is like, as you say, an opportunity.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.280]   It's like, well, Jason's not here.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.000]   So we have Paul McCartney on, but we don't want to talk all about
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.400]   music or societal changes in the 60s.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:11.720]   Right.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.400]   Hey Andy, how are you doing on that Raspberry Pi project?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.640]   I want to know about the real tough concert.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.240]   I mean, I like the fact that you're comparing me to Paul McCartney.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   You are the cute one.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.080]   I'll take you out.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.640]   I'll take that.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.920]   I will say my opinion of Paul McCartney went up enormously after watching all of that
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.120]   get back documentary.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.880]   And it was like, oh, he really did have to corral all these people.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.400]   And he was doing all this work.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:43.640]   Wow.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:43.960]   Okay.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.520]   So that was one thing about that.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.400]   John comes in with you.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.040]   Yoko, the other thing is my opinion of Yoko went up.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.240]   That she wasn't the, you know, the evil wife breaking up the Beatles there.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.520]   She just was sitting there knitting.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.480]   But really the problem was they were both on heroin.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.640]   John and Yoko were completely zoned out on heroin.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.120]   I just think everybody, the Ringo just seemed to be happy to be there.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.000]   Ringo was happy.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.160]   George was a little cranky.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.560]   And Paul was George Braggle.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.840]   But George is the one that brought the 24th track.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.640]   He had like the,
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.600]   this is studio, the 24th track recorder.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.760]   That took like a electrical engineer to run.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.680]   You know, like there was this one kid who knew how to run it.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.760]   And he's the only one that had to run it.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.840]   And it was like this very complex.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.640]   It was a really great documentary.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.480]   Like you think, like when Peter Jackson did it, you were like,
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.920]   I don't know why he did that.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   Like it just seemed like a really deep dive.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.240]   And now you want, I haven't seen the whole, the long version, but I'm.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.120]   Oh, I've watched it all many.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.520]   What is it?
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.120]   It is worth it.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.560]   I put it on in the background.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.200]   Exactly.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.800]   You're just kind of, you're hanging out.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.920]   Hanging with the Beatles.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.400]   Watching them compose songs in like 30 seconds.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.760]   And yeah.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.640]   That's the moment.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.080]   So when Paul sits down and says,
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.440]   well, let me noodle on the piano and let it be comes out.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.640]   Or you know, you're trying to figure out how to, what get back is going to be.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.680]   And just watching them compose.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.360]   Or even like all the extra information, just incidental information.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.200]   I think it was a Paul who said that, like, that people are going to say
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.480]   that the Beatles broke up because because Yoko sat on an amp.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.160]   Like, no, no, that's not.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.400]   Yoko is a completely benign presence the entire time.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.880]   She just reading the racing news, knitting.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.840]   Everyone said, oh, I'll she'd break out now.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.560]   It wasn't, you know, it was welcome.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.080]   Nobody was minding it.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:39.960]   It was very important.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.760]   I was correct.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.280]   The best part is, of course, when they,
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.920]   boy, we're really far out of field now.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.680]   It's your fault when you mentioned Paul.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.040]   But the best part is when they put a microphone in the teapot in the lunch
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.880]   room.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.000]   And without their knowledge, recorded John and Paul and Paul, and Paul's really
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.280]   trying to keep John in the band.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.760]   And it was, it was really interesting to hear that real, very genuine dynamic
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.920]   when they thought they were off mic and off camera.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.320]   It's a little, you know, here we are sitting there.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.080]   Really, they put a microphone in the teapot.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.400]   That was rude, but I'm glad they did.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.520]   His from historical.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.400]   Thank goodness.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.640]   They, from a historical point of view.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.680]   Anyway, enough of the Beatles.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.600]   I will take the, I'm Ringo.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.720]   I think of the fourth.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   Ringo.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.120]   Okay.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.080]   I'm not going to take Paul the car.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.880]   Ringo's good.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.840]   I know that.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.240]   If Ringo came on, we'd have the same questions for him.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:35.160]   So what overall, did you, how do you consume WWDC?
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.040]   Do you watch a lot of the tracks?
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.880]   So I'll watch like with the remote stuff.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:48.440]   Like there's no point for a developer like me really to do the travel over for the current
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.400]   kind of format of the conference because you're, you're going to end up spending like $10,000
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.160]   to sit in Apple Park and watch a video that I could also watch.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:57.640]   Yes.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.520]   That's a good plan.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.320]   Yes.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.240]   And there is, you know, that it's more now than it was.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.680]   Like I think as the years go past, I think they're adding more and more like in-person
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.080]   stuff that is actually, I think, useful.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.800]   And maybe next year is the time where I would actually go over.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.760]   But so what I've done for the last couple of years is, you know, I'll sit and I'll watch the
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:27.320]   Rekino and the State of the Union live and sort of previously I would tweet out my unfiltered
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.480]   thoughts and now I just post them to Mastodon.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.840]   It's much the same.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:39.480]   And, you know, I will then like get the sort of high level view of everything.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.040]   And then I'll see what has changed, what I think is going to impact me.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:50.120]   Like it's always good when you can come out of a keynote and think I actually don't need
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.400]   to do anything.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.080]   That is the best feeling in the entire world of like, if I do nothing, everything will still
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.880]   work and it's cool.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.200]   Because in that situation, it's like, oh, I could actually spend some time working on
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.800]   features and things for the users rather than just catching up with what Apple wants this
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.640]   year.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.480]   But I mean, so you see what the big stuff is.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:22.440]   And then it's a case of like watch, you know, they release a bunch of the sessions day by
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   day.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.040]   I mean, everything is recorded probably weeks beforehand now, which I think is good because
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.960]   it gives, you know, some of the people who are presenting who would, if I had to do it,
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.040]   certainly I would freak out standing in front of like a thousand to five thousand people
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:45.000]   having to give a very technical talk live with code, which could break a moment's notice.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.520]   And now they can at least, they can have a lot of people on who are doing their things
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.040]   and recording their stuff.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.880]   And I will sit and I will watch, you know, just what interests me.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.200]   I'm curious as to I've watched probably 20 or 30 other ones from this.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.240]   And usually that's about the range that I watch from WWDC and how many are there
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   total?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.200]   Is that like a third of the total?
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   Oh, so many.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   So there's a lot.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200]   A lot.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Okay.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.000]   30s a lot sounds like a lot to me because they're in each an hour long.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   That's a lot of hours to put in.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.880]   Most of them, there's a lot of half an hour, I would say these days, because they make
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   them just basically the length they need to rather than, you know, you have to fill a
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.560]   particular slot in a conference.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.120]   I think that it was, I think that there's about a hundred of them, I think, somewhere
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.360]   in that ballpark, like 90 to 110 typically, there's typically six a day for, there used
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.880]   to be four rooms that did them.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.640]   So four rooms that did six a day.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.240]   And then, and they would have to add to your point, most of them had to, the target was
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.560]   I think to last like 40 minutes or 45 minutes long.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.200]   And a lot of times it felt like things were getting stretched out because they don't take
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   Q and A.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.240]   So it wasn't, you weren't, you weren't getting any benefit from it.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:56.280]   I have to say that I find them much more pleasurable to watch now than they, than when they were
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   alive.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   The audio is much better.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.920]   The imagery is much better, which is much easier to watch them, especially at speed,
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.640]   except in the WCP, which doesn't have a, I don't know if you watch them at 1X or do you
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.440]   watch them faster than they would.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.720]   I watch at 1X if I watched anything at higher speed when my brain would explode.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   It's just, I also like.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   I watch the option mode.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.120]   So the problem with the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Apple TV app is that it
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   runs it.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   It's a 1.5 or two.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.200]   You can always tell that someone doesn't actually watch things fast when they skip 1.75 because
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.160]   1.75 is the right number for most things.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.400]   And so, so I'm always like on the T top of those, but I just find them to be, I felt like
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.120]   it's a huge jump forward as far as I'm curious.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   So you.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.880]   I mean, the other thing that they do in them is that they have the transcripts there immediately,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.520]   which is very helpful because like I can, before I even watch a session, I can just have
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.400]   a quick scan through the transcript and see if it is talking about the kind of thing that
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.720]   I'm interested in.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:01.120]   Sometimes it's not obvious, particularly from the title, what the level of technical complexity
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.240]   is going to be.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.480]   So yeah, I mean, I think the developer, that's pretty good.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.640]   As I say, I watch all the stuff at 1X anyway.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.560]   But I can't watch all of it because there's so much.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.040]   And if I do try and watch all of it, I will remember none of it.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.840]   Well, and you want to watch the stuff that's germane to the, you know, your program.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.440]   And some of it is also you want to watch the stuff that's like new and exciting.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.120]   So like all the vision pro stuff that that's kind of like, well, this is how are they going
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.920]   to do this, you know, what, because you get the broad strokes in the other things, but
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.520]   then you get in like, how is this implemented?
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.680]   How, what can I do?
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.280]   What can't I do?
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.920]   And yeah, so I've watched a lot of vision pro stuff, which is not like we haven't, we
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.840]   can't even order SDKs at this point.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.440]   So, you know, I have front loaded my brain with all the information that is completely
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.880]   useless at this point.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   And may well change.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.000]   I mean, I really get the feeling I liken it on one of our shows to a concept car that
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.160]   you might see at an auto show.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.920]   I get the feeling that when it does come out, it may be a somewhat different product.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   In fact, I'm betting that the scary eyes in the front will be gone.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.360]   I don't think I think they are 100% staying.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.560]   I think that's the whole thing of their design because it's like they are, they are a nobody
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.720]   else has ever done it.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.600]   So this thing stands for good reason.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:34.080]   And if it stands out in a way that I don't like, but I think like I get what they're
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.480]   trying to do that they're trying to kind of make it less cutting you off from the world.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   And that's the same.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.680]   Yeah, but you are cut off and putting an uncanny valley pair of eyes on the front does not
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.800]   make you less cut off.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.320]   It just makes people run away in the other direction, to be honest.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.520]   I will say I haven't tried it.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.400]   So like, yeah, neither has by the way, any Apple executive, I think it's telling that
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.920]   they didn't nobody wore them, which means they're not ready, right?
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   That they're all simulated in the videos.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:12.560]   No, I mean, I think like, I suspect the stuff is like three quarters there.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.800]   And I think that, you know, the the the foundations are probably working pretty well.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.320]   I mean, from the sounds of the people I know who have got demos, like the technology, like
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.920]   the software certainly was impressive.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:33.080]   Some of the software, like, I know some people that when they had their head scanned for the
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:40.560]   FaceTime thing, they didn't get a particularly pleasant looking avatar out of that.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.440]   But, you know, I could see that stuff improving.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.200]   I just I I it's like.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.720]   So when the iPad came out or before the iPad came out, when when there was it was announced
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:01.160]   and we got developer kits for it, we could write apps in the simulator and same for the
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.120]   watch and same for other things.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.080]   Like we could write the apps and we could see them on a screen and we could interact with
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.360]   them, but it didn't give you the sense of what it would be like to actually use the
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.560]   thing, which affects how you build your apps.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.920]   So there is a sort of once you're actually using it as a feedback process of I'm playing
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   with it.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.400]   Oh, this makes sense to do it this way or this is, you know, this thing is too far away from
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.000]   where your fingers would be or this button is too small or something.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.200]   And I think there's going to be a process for this as well is like once we actually get
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.600]   to use them and see what it's like to use them.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.440]   And this is such a shift in terms of like thinking and design.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.160]   I mean, in some ways it's not because like the apps they're showing off are kind of like
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   mostly 2D windows that you're moving around with 3D content.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.680]   But until I have one of those things on my face and I am actively running my code on
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.840]   it, I am hesitant to pass judgment on it because I just don't know what it's like.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:14.080]   And I have skepticism.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.240]   I still don't know what it's for.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:23.720]   Like I get that this is like technologically possibly the most sophisticated piece of consumer
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.360]   electronics ever made, shall we say?
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.320]   I still don't get what it's for.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.080]   But I haven't tried it.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   So that's the thing.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.840]   I can't throw stones at it.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:44.440]   Specifically about the magic eyeballs, I'm not sure that that could become the touch bar
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.120]   of the Vision Pro.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.200]   That could be the thing that, okay, we really thought this we had something.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.320]   It turns out we didn't have anything here.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.240]   We're going to start to give you back all the buttons that you're complaining that you
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   didn't have.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.960]   Well, and if they're going to make a less expensive version, those screens are one way
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.600]   to cut a couple of hundred bucks.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:08.480]   Well, not only that, but that's a display right at the very front of the device on a device
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.240]   that could be made lighter anyway, and you don't want weight at the front anyway.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.960]   The other and another problem is that this is I've been reading a lot more about like
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.640]   what like what designers of night vision goggles have been learning about just the just the
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.840]   mechanics of how to design something that you wear on your face and people are going
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.440]   to be looking around through the world that and another complaint that's coming through
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.680]   about this design is that because you have this screen that has to be has to cover the
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.920]   entire front plate, you can't have cameras like right where your pupils would be, which
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.760]   and so they're going to be lowered like another like inch or so from where you're actually
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.680]   looking, which it remains to be seen how confusing that's going to be.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.760]   There's a paper that I read about again, people who are designing these things for night vision
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.320]   saying that even moving these down a little bit causes a bit of confusion because the
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.720]   brain it creates a whole bunch of problems where the brain adapts and then when you take
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.400]   the goggles off your brain now has to deal with the fact that there's this entirely new
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.200]   way of looking at the world.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.080]   So there are a lot of small things about it.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.400]   It just it just and a lot of these things are going to be maybe worthy expense so to speak
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.560]   because of the technology, but I it really changed my mind about again them what I have
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:33.840]   to call the dericively the magic eyeball effect that has to really now be very, very important.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.360]   It has to be crucial.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.240]   It has to be a signature thing that says, Oh my God, Apple has figured something out here
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.160]   that no one else has figured out and everybody has to start stealing this idea.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:49.240]   It turns out to be such a great idea to have this screen facing outward to make it worth
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.600]   like the extra weight and the extra changes that makes the balance in my eye.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.560]   And I don't think it's just looks, yeah, I think there's a reason why they didn't demo
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.320]   it to anybody at all under any circumstances during WWE.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.920]   And I'm assuming that the eyes and that the like section of face that they're displaying
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   is the same CG face that they're capturing for FaceTime.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.600]   I think everybody thinks that is.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.040]   So I do think that there is going to be like that slight extra uncanny valley to that view
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.320]   because if it is, if it is that, but still, I haven't seen it.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.520]   So I like this could be like when I see it in person, I will go right.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   I get it.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   This makes sense.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:48.000]   So I am hesitant, but curious enough that I will probably drop $3,500 to see how it works.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.960]   So another data point from ScooterX and our IRC, the Apple Vision Pro video is now the
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.360]   most viewed Apple video on YouTube with 50 million views in the first week.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.720]   So there's certainly interest in it.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   People want to see it.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:12.480]   This is, I think probably the most kind of futuristic thing they've done for a long time.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   I mean, like the iPhone, when we all got the iPhone, we were like, this is great.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.760]   It has a great user interface.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.120]   This entirely makes sense.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.520]   They've done amazing things, but it's a phone.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.520]   We understand this.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520]   It's a touchscreen.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.800]   We've kind of seen those before, not as good as this.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.000]   This thing is like, oh, and here's a spaceship.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Right.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   They've boldly gone.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.440]   I've never flown a spaceship before.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.840]   I don't know what it's like.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   Right.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   That's right.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.200]   And I think Apple deserves, and a lot of people give it a lot of credit for what Apple's done
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.080]   in the past, but this is not like anything Apple's done in the past.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.800]   It is a bit of a reach for that.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.920]   I think the pricing also helps scare off a lot of the, a lot of folks that aren't sure.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.320]   So you're going to end up with a lot of people that are, they're testing it.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:06.520]   I think that it is, I think that I think that they'll probably keep the eyes in some form.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.800]   They're going to have to keep on developing them.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.200]   I think that they're part of the interface to tell you that someone's looking at you.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   Right.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   No, I understand why they're there.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   I tell you why they're not there.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   But I think it's also the thing that's good.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.760]   That's, people are going to fixate on as being the creepiest part of it.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.200]   And I think that that's something Apple's got to fight against.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:28.280]   Hey, James, let me ask you if it's Mac OS or iOS or its own OS, you tooted the day at
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:34.960]   WWDC that it looks like they're out of sync that iOS 17, but XROS 1.0.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.720]   Somebody responded to you that he didn't think it is iOS.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.360]   Do you have a better sense of that now?
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.080]   I'm not 100% sure.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:49.320]   I think like any of Apple's operating systems, they're all generally, or certainly the iOS
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.200]   derivatives, like what's on a home pod or what's on a watch or whatever.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.680]   I think they're all kind of like, there's a lot of core stuff that's the same.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.880]   It's the Mac kernel plus the basic core OS on top of that.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:09.680]   And I don't think that this is anything radically different from that, except it's got like
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.440]   a bunch of real time stuff in it.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   So I think all of these OS's are related.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.720]   They're at least very close cousins.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.960]   Yeah, that makes that's fair.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:31.240]   This is the stack that Apple put in the keynote.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.120]   And so there are iOS frameworks at the top level, as well as special frameworks that
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:41.720]   are spatial for the particular Vision Pro and the spatial audio engine, plus the phovated
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.600]   renderer and the multi app 3D engine.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.480]   Those are all unique to the Vision Pro.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   It's interesting.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.920]   But that big core OS section of the board, probably the same thing that's on everything.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   Right.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.520]   Same kernel across all platforms.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.920]   Yeah, and smart kernel.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.920]   I think so.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.640]   I mean, even my monitor is running some.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.160]   Yeah, even your studio, you have a studio display, then I know.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   Yes.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   Your little iOS display.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.440]   Let's take a little break.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.160]   James Thompson, our guest, P.Calc's author.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:26.120]   If you have not yet installed P.Calc on your iOS, your iPad, OS and your Mac OS, go to pcalc.com
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.360]   and check it out.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:37.800]   And of course, don't forget dice if you are a tabletop gamer by P.Calc infinite polyhedral
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:45.200]   die just for you in a 3D emulator.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.800]   So you can see your die rolling in AR are showed today brought to you by.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.880]   Oh, and I forgot Alex Lindsay's also here in any taco.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   You guys are also here.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.480]   We have somebody when Paul McCartney or Ringo's on, we got to talk to him.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.120]   That's just no this this this this week.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.600]   This week James this week.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.400]   This week your Diana Ross, where the supreme.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:19.160]   I will accept those more than Paul.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:28.320]   Are you sure today brought to you by this AG one by athletic greens love this product.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:34.800]   Like many of you, especially during quarantine, I wanted to support my health with, you know,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.520]   and I ended up having a fistful of supplements that I would take every morning.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.160]   But this has changed my life.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.320]   AG one from athletic greens.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:47.400]   I can give my body what it craves all in one daily nutritional drink.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   It's the first thing I drink in the morning.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.480]   So this is 12 ounces of cold water.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:58.560]   AG one comes, you know, normally you'd get the the packet, the big packet and the scoop,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.760]   the month's supply and the and the canister, which comes with the full package.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   But I like these.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.560]   I'm going to Disneyland tonight and I'm going to bring these along with me.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.720]   So I have my AG one and my travel packs.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.800]   It shakes up easily.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.400]   It tastes fantastic.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.760]   AG one's been around for a long time since 2010.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:22.560]   It's become part of a million routines since, you know, when I started doing the AG one
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.040]   thing I asked around and everybody I know, they have prunes that I haven't used that
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040]   for years.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.280]   It's the best all in one solution for daily nutrition, saves you time, confusion, money,
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.400]   a lot of money.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.400]   I was spending a lot of money, $3 a day, a little less than $3 a day for AG one.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.000]   It's got everything.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.880]   It's got supplements, it's got probiotics, prebiotics.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:51.280]   This is the best bang for your buck, a seamless, easy daily habit that covers your day's nutritional
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   basis.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.080]   75 high quality minerals, vitamins, pre and pro biotic.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:01.640]   So if you're looking for a simpler and cost effective supplement routine, AG one, my friends

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.400]   My mouth is actually watering because I look forward to this every morning.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.160]   It tastes really good.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.560]   Athleticgreens.com/macbreak.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.320]   Please use that address so they know you saw it here.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.720]   Athleticgreens.com/macbreak.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:36.200]   Is there anything in iOS 17, James, you were particularly excited about or interested in?
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.120]   I guess you could do an iPadOS as well if you want.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:46.080]   I think there was lots of little things that...
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.280]   That's how it's been for the last few years, right?
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.600]   It's all kind of a little incremental.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   I mean, I think there was like...
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:58.240]   I genuinely said, by the time we got to the keynote just before the Vision Pro, if that
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:04.760]   had been all there was, I would have been pretty happy with the show because there was
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   enough stuff, like things like the improvements to autocorrect and stuff like that.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   That's going to affect billions of people.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.400]   You could finally swear with that ducking autocorrect.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   Yes, good.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Finally.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:27.560]   There was little things like just being able to share air tags amongst people that is going
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.840]   to be so useful.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:37.680]   Like if I put an air tag on my bike and my wife rides it, she's not going to get a constant
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.440]   warning that she's being tracked because of the peak bite.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.680]   There's lots of little things like that.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:52.520]   I would say the thing that caught me the most was the return of interactive widgets because
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:47:02.720]   that's I think going to make a lot of stuff a lot easier in terms of having very quick
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.920]   access to doing stuff.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:11.560]   You just want to check off a task or do something and you don't want to fire up an entire app
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.760]   to do it.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   So I have my own history with widgets.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760]   Yes, you do.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.320]   I may remember.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:31.880]   Back in the distant past of 2014 when we got our first widgets, first old school widgets
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.680]   because they're a completely different mechanism.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.600]   I built a peak out widget because there was a calculator widget that Apple did that was
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.160]   on the Mac and they didn't do one on iOS and I thought, well, they've done it on the Mac,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.280]   so I'll do it on the Mac and I'll do it on iOS as well.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.000]   And as I said before, the core logic of peak out because small self-contained, so I just
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   stuffed it in there and it released.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   It was very popular.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.600]   It got featured by Apple on the store as one of the best examples of a widget.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.480]   And then a few weeks after the introduction, I got contacted by Apple and I was told I
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:20.640]   had to remove the widget because I quote widgets couldn't perform calculations.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.920]   That's so Apple.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:32.520]   And it was the kind of one half of your company is featuring this as a great example.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.760]   And then the other half is telling me that widgets are not allowed to do this, so can't
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   do it.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.680]   Because I tweeted about that because there was a bit of back and forth and then they
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.440]   basically said, look, final decision, this is what's going to happen.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:53.040]   There is no higher power you can appeal to just accept it, remove it, move on.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:58.360]   So I tweeted about that, then I went out for dinner and when I came back, it had been
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:04.200]   retweeted a lot and had ended up on like CNN and places like that.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:12.360]   And I was like, oh, no, because like Apple, you know, Apple says, don't run to the press.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360]   It never works.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:21.640]   I think that languages in the user, they review guidelines.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   That's not true.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:27.880]   You know, running to the press does actually work sometimes, sometimes.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.040]   But I hadn't actually intended it like that.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.920]   But you know, people like Jason and whatever had picked this up and retweeted it, Christina
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.880]   Warren said stuff about it.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   It got big coverage and I got a phone call the next day from Apple saying, we have changed
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.880]   our mind.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:49.040]   You can do, you know, widgets can do anything they like, please carry on.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:57.000]   And it was extremely surreal time and extremely stressful time because I'd spent a lot of
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.800]   work on this to get them to working.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:08.040]   And it turned out to be an extremely lucrative time as well because it raised the profile
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.240]   of peak out enormously.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:17.400]   And like that year I bought, I think it was, I bought a pretty nice retina I'm at and I
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.600]   had a holiday in the sun.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   And that was how I relaxed from the stress of all that.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   And you know, I think the thing was like engineering, the engineering side, we're absolutely happy
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   with people doing this.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.720]   They built these things to be flexible and, you know, whatever.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:41.440]   The mark, the app store editorial people were happy with it because look, hey, there's a
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.640]   thing, people like it.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   It's great.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.440]   It's functional.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.160]   Somebody somewhere, I don't know who had a problem with this.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:56.200]   And their mind was changed, I don't know by the swell of public opinion or by somebody
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.840]   higher up the chain or whatever.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.240]   But that change happened and what that actually meant.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.880]   It wasn't just me because there were other people as well who were told, nah, you're
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.040]   widgets doing too many things.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.600]   We don't like this because we're Apple and we like things to be simple and stressful.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.160]   Was there any technical reason?
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.120]   I mean, is it like killing battery or something?
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:25.360]   The thing was, I would say for Pee-Calp, no, because like the core of Pee-Calp was running
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.720]   on 68,000 Motorola chips.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.920]   It's not that heavy.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   It's math, baby.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   It's math.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:40.120]   No matter how tired the hamster was at the end of the day, it seemed like you could still
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.840]   generate math.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.720]   You know, adding numbers together, pretty basic stuff for CPUs.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:55.360]   There may have been, I think, I was pushing the bounds of how much memory the widget was
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.640]   using, but there was a fixed limit.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   It was very low.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.680]   It was like 64 megabytes.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.920]   You could use that and then your widget got killed.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.400]   So there was a lot of optimization to fit it into that space, but it worked and it fitted
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   fine.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:17.800]   So that's actually an amazing number to think that you did 64 megabytes to implement a
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   widget.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.440]   It's kind of mind-boggling.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:29.240]   But like fast forward to this WWDC announcement, and we've had these non-interactive widgets
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.440]   for the last couple of years since 2020, which are completely different.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.320]   They're written in SwiftUI.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:42.480]   And you can have buttons on them, but the button just triggers URL, which can open your app
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.480]   and do a specific--
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.400]   They were basically images on the screen.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   They were not--
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.240]   Yeah, I mean, like, effectively.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   You can have some interactive timers and things on them, I think.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.560]   Anyway, point being that you could do something like in Dice by PCOT.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.840]   I've got widgets and it's got an array of dice on it and you press one of those and
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.600]   it'll launch the app and it'll tell the app to roll that dice.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.840]   So it works as a kind of quick launcher.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:16.880]   But what these now do is you can have a button that when you press it, it will execute a
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.600]   piece of code and then you can transmit information back to the widget.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   They're interactive.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   You can do something with them.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.000]   Which is kind of what you did when you first did the widget, right?
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Way back when?
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.800]   I was listening to upgrade with Jason and Mike Hurley and they were--
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:45.880]   They had just come out of like some briefings or whatever and they said, "James can't make
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.200]   a calculator with this."
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.600]   You know, it's not meant for that.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   It's--
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.280]   You know, it can't be done basically, I think.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Who they?
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:02.400]   Well, Apple Day or Mike and Jason, they mentioned you by name.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.280]   It said, "James, don't get excited."
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.920]   I have no knowledge as to what transpired, who they talked to.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   But somebody said--
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:17.200]   But all I heard was, "You're not allowed to do this."
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:23.440]   And so what I did was before the end of that day, I had a working prototype of peak out
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   running as a widget in the new--
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   You were a good one for punishment.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.440]   Well, it was like--
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.440]   It was a challenge.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.640]   They threw down the gauntlet.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.560]   I mean, they didn't throw it down.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.880]   But it was like the best way to get me to do something is to tell me that I have not
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   allowed to do it.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:47.680]   So I have a prototype that, you know, it's just a really basic thing and it looks terrible.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.160]   But it's got buttons on it.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.560]   You can push the buttons and you get numbers.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:57.240]   But are you afraid that if you did that, they would then say, "Well, yes, technically
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.040]   you're able, but we're not going to let you--
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:03.000]   Would you have the same issue that you had last time?"
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.440]   This is indeed the billion-dollar question.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.160]   You know, what is going to happen if I submit this?
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.120]   And I don't know the answer.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:17.680]   And the thing is, there's nothing in the rules to say that you can't do it.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:26.640]   So what they would have to do is they would have to say something like, "Well, we've now
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.720]   got a rule which says you cannot have more than four buttons or something like that."
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:38.120]   But they have to actually specify it and they have to draw--
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.120]   You can't--
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.880]   It's very difficult when you're saying, like, these things can be interactive and they can
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.520]   run code.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.920]   But they can't run too much, or they can't be too--
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.800]   I mean, like, for example, if I made a dice by peak output, it's almost exactly the same
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.400]   look as the current one.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.560]   And it's got a row of buttons for different dice.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:55:59.880]   I could have a thing.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.560]   You press a D20 and it gives you back a number between 1 and 20.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.800]   Is that too much calculations?
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.120]   Is that--
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.000]   You know, am I crossing the line with that?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.400]   But I'm not-- or I'm in not crossing the line with that, but I am crossing it with a calculator.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:20.000]   And somebody somewhere has to sit down and they have to formalize a rule or they have
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.440]   to just, you know, kind of--
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.880]   What I hope is that they will say, "Hey, this is really cool.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   You've done it again.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.880]   This is brilliant."
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:29.880]   You know.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.880]   We all--
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   We all--
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.880]   We all--
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   I left--
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.360]   Young man, I like the kind of your gym.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.840]   You're a rule breaker in a maverick.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   Or--
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.920]   I could use someone like you on our team.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Exactly.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:46.360]   So Tim Cook is going to sit down and he's going to say, "You know, we didn't think this
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.400]   should be done, but I've seen it and I was wrong."
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:55.200]   The Grinch's Grinchy heart went up four slices that day.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.200]   Tim Cook, not a Grinch.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.680]   He's approved my apps.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   No, he is anti-grinch.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.840]   He is very-- he is on record anti-grinch.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.840]   You see, he says as such--
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.840]   He may look like Winnie the Pooh, but he's anti-grinch.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.840]   Okay, fine.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   So, Lila, the Pooh, or--
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.440]   Yes, no, it's not an entity or who is never going to be invited to the event anyway, so
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.440]   who cares?
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:24.640]   Yeah, but some of us are entire income stream based on the generosity of Apple.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   Yes.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.640]   So I say nothing negative about that.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   No, they're wonderful.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   They're such situations.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   Wonderful.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.480]   And also, Apple is not one person.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.880]   Apple is like a thousand little divisions who all have different opinions.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.800]   You're hoping, Andy, that they don't say, "James, you're a sp--
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.320]   I'm a spunkie, and I hate spunk."
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.440]   He got one of these spunk.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.280]   The other way to enjoy it.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   You got mocks.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   He can.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   Mocks it.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:55.720]   Hey, let me just-- yeah, I completely parenthetically side bar, but do you use Apple's random number
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.520]   generator or do you create your own or how do you make sure those numbers, those dice
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.520]   numbers are--
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   I use Apple's.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   The Apple has good--
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.320]   They have a good pseudo and random stuff.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   Is it pseudo?
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.720]   But it is pseudo.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   But it's good.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   And it's genuinely good enough for like--
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   OK.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720]   --D20 or something like that.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.240]   But I also-- I don't know what the number is at that point.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.720]   What I do is when I roll the dice, I'm simulating the physics of it.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   So I'm--
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.720]   Oh.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   --I have a 3D object with--
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   --and I am throwing it.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.720]   But I throw it and put a different like spin and force.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   Oh, that's really cool.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   You're not just saying you give me a rubber from 1 to 20.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.720]   You actually--
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   No, no.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.880]   You're simulating the roll of the dice.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.800]   So that's where I use the random number stuff to work out like just how much force
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.400]   that's been put on the dice as you roll it.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.640]   And then the physics engine takes over and it bounces around.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.080]   And once it stops moving, you have a number.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   It's not like I say--
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:00.360]   It's not like I say, just give me a number between 1 and 20.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:09.120]   So I mean, I think it's pretty random.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.920]   You can set it to auto roll and then export statistics if you want to know exactly that
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   this is not weighted or anything like that.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:28.120]   So yeah, I think that I stake my role playing game play on it being correct.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:32.760]   I'll stack it against any dice tower ever made by a fun non-thingiverse.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   Yes.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   I am going to make-- at some point, I am going to make a virtual dice tower just--
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.760]   Oh, God.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.760]   Bless you, sir.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.320]   I said-- and I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:51.200]   I love your apps because they're like the food at a diner where it's like here.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:58.000]   Here is a cheese omelet, but it's going to be executed absolutely perfectly.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.320]   It's at the pinnacle of what cooking can be simply because it's a basic thing but executed
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.400]   with no excuses, no mistakes, no factor of it has not been thought about.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   Even when you think it's done, they couldn't enhance it.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.040]   You enhance your stuff more.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.560]   So when I think that you were adding a dice tower, I'm going to say, oh, gosh, it's funny
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.240]   that-- no, this is exactly what this app is supposed to be.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240]   It'll be these--
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.240]   I'm not--
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.240]   The Socratic Dice Tower, right?
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:31.360]   This is why I am happy to be one of the pips to your Gladys Knight any day.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:39.160]   I've decided I'm now-- Jimmy Page, if we're going to pivot into different plans.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.360]   Anyway, I mean, I will put entirely over an engineered cheese omelet on my--
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.320]   Right, it's the Platonic a deal of dice towers.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.160]   I think James is in the pantheon of Apple developers for that reason.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.560]   I think that's one of the things that makes--
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.760]   it was first the Mac, but in general, Apple--
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.400]   I hope they give people credit because one of the things that makes Apple so appealing
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.480]   and all of its hardware is that there are a few handful of developers--
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   we used to call them the delicious library guys, right?
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:17.000]   Who put that extra care into their apps who are really--
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.640]   they're not just cranking them out, which is something you see on the Windows side more.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.720]   I think that's what makes Apple unique.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.040]   Thank you, James, because--
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.200]   and Apple really-- honestly, Apple should absolutely venerate you because that is the
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.400]   distinction, in my opinion, between Apple software and everybody else's software.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.360]   I will be happy just to be tolerated.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.240]   Tolerated, not venerated, huh?
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:52.040]   Yeah, I mean, I humbly accept your praise, but--
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.480]   there are a lot of people out there, I think, doing really good stuff.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   Oh, yeah, it's not just you, absolutely.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.760]   You know, like-- and it's not just like people with gray hair.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.920]   I mean, I think there are a lot of younger developers who are doing really cool stuff.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   No, and look at the Apple design winners to give you a good example of that.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   Exactly.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.600]   And it's like, I'm not bitter that I've never won one of those.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.200]   No, I mean, I entered once back in like--
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.880]   oh, god, I was it-- I don't think I entered while I was an Apple employee because that
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.280]   would be wrong.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.240]   But I think it was shortly afterwards or something.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.080]   But anyway, a drag thing, if anybody remembers--
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.560]   Oh, I love drag things.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   --to be trying to catch up.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.520]   That was entered for one once.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:49.400]   And I basically got told-- and I was asked to submit it.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.640]   So I submitted it.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.680]   And then they said, no.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.840]   And I was like, well, why did you ask me?
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840]   Oh, my god.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.320]   So I never did anything from there.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.440]   And nowadays, it's pretty much-- I kind of don't call us.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   We'll call you.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.800]   We will find your apps.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:09.440]   And I think it's right that they are celebrating the new stuff and not the stuff that's been
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.880]   around for 30 years because everybody knows-- not everybody.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.400]   I mean, a lot of people know P.K.L.K. and know these things.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.720]   So there's no point.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.480]   Well, I give you the unofficial designer.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.280]   I will take the Mac break or weekly design.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.800]   Do you have actually been-- many times been a pick on Mac break, as you well know.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:40.240]   So I-- I-- yes, I-- even when I don't catch the shows often, as I would like, whenever
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.040]   my Google alerts or whatever fire to say that I'd be mentioned--
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.560]   Again.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.560]   Again, he has.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   All right.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560]   So--
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.360]   Yeah, I'll just quickly say that Leo, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:58.400]   The only thing that I really miss about not having an iPhone, but having Android is that
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.600]   I love my Android hardware.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.240]   I love the things that I can do with the Android that I can't do with the iPhone.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:11.960]   But the creativity and the-- I don't know, the artistry of the apps just isn't there.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   They're great.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.960]   They're solid.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   They do what they have to do.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.800]   I can't remember the last time that I downloaded an app to my Android phone that gave me the
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.200]   level of delight that most-- most iPhone apps do.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.920]   That's something that Apple really needs to be praised for, as much as we-- as much as
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.600]   we laugh about-- about the interactions between Apple and developers time and time again.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.720]   They've created something that attracts the sort of people that, oh my God, this is a
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720]   wonderful canvas.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.440]   I can be as weird as I want.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   I can execute a program to an app to the extent of my individuality here.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440]   And Google just has never been able to do that.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.920]   Yeah, there was-- we used to call it the delicious generation because of a delicious
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   library.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.200]   Those were very scumorphic, all of those.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.640]   We've come a long way since then.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.240]   But there is absolutely a care and attention to detail.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:06.880]   And even more an attention to aesthetics on the Apple side that just is really lacking
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.040]   everywhere else.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.520]   And that's one of the reasons we still love our Macs.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.000]   So, Apple really needs to understand that.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.360]   They put that into their hardware and their OS's.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.520]   And I think that that's also why it's hard to get Mac.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.800]   Apple users, whether it's an iPhone or a Mac or iPad to go to another platform-- is
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.040]   because you open it up and you just feel like the fit and finish is gone.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.720]   You just kind of like you went from something that everything's kind of nice and rounded
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.800]   and fitting and everything fits together.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.040]   And then everything's kind of like, it's all still there.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   It's just not pretty anymore.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.880]   I mean, the thing that is like, when Apple does something, let's say the new settings
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.880]   app or something and everybody's tearing stuff apart or whatever.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.520]   And like, oh, Apple's completely lost the ability to do design, blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:02.160]   And then you actually compare all that stuff to any other platform and it is still superior.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.120]   I think that's the thing that people forget is like, yes, we complain about this stuff.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.280]   We complain about this stuff because we love it.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:17.840]   And because it's-- we feel, ah, this could be slightly more Mac-like or whatever it is.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:25.440]   But yeah, I mean, I've been using a few other-- like, show me the television that the user
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.280]   interface is in any way good.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.840]   We've never seen you.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.840]   Horrible.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:38.680]   Even like I got-- I just got the-- one of the hobo Libra II e-readers.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.560]   And it's nice.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.560]   But the interface isn't quite as good as it should be.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.120]   And it's the same on every piece of consumer electronics.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:55.600]   It's just like, it's functional, but it's not consistent and it's not whatever.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.280]   So yeah, I mean, I've still got like, sat next to me.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:05.560]   I have a copy of the human interface guidelines from '91 or whatever it is.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.240]   I was just going to refer to that.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:13.960]   And that book was like my bible when I was developing software.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.240]   It was like, read this, internalize it.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.600]   I literally-- at university, we had-- my favorite class of like, the entire competing
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.120]   science course that I did was a human interface design class.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:32.400]   And what they would do is they would take something like the open and save boxes on the
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:41.280]   Mac and they would completely disassemble it and say, this is why they made this choice.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.840]   This is how-- and we would do things like we would do user testing.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.040]   And it's like, let's find out what the best way to do something is to make it easy for
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040]   users or whatever.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:57.100]   And I think that kind of class is still ingrained in my brain as I want to do the
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.160]   business right and those guidelines and everything else.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:10.040]   So I think that is-- and even people who are young, but they didn't encounter that stuff
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:16.800]   or they've started on iOS or whatever, it's still-- there is the quality there that inspires
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.840]   people to make more quality things so that they look good on the platform.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.120]   I was so nostalgic for it.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.800]   I went out and found a copy on eBay.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.900]   I think of the original inside Macintosh notebooks.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:34.260]   And yeah, I don't know if I was Steve Jobs or I doubt it was.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.380]   I'm sure there were others.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:43.380]   But for some reason, Apple really had this vision, this unified vision in 1984 and continued
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.380]   it.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:48.380]   It's attenuated a little bit and things like settings, maybe you're an example of where
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.420]   it's not quite huge too.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.220]   That's very modal.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.920]   But if you compare it with settings on Windows--
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.220]   Control-
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.220]   Yeah, it's not Windows.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.220]   I mean, you'll appreciate it.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:08.100]   I was setting up Windows 11 in VMware last week to do something and it's like, "Oh, I
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.100]   hate this.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.100]   I hate this.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.100]   I hate it for the neighbors."
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100]   We're a little prejudiced.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.340]   And I think that one of the things that did drive that is Steve Jobs very early on learned
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:19.340]   calligraphy.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.340]   Right.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.780]   Or he was a man's thief for sure.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   Yes.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.460]   And really was into topography and everything else.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:31.700]   And topography is kind of in many ways the finest version of attention to detail.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:36.220]   Because you're talking about the space between things and how big the serifs are and what
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.740]   the ex-height is.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.420]   And all of those things make a difference.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:44.740]   And I think when you're paying attention to things at that level, it's one of the things
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.780]   like, for instance, when I use keynote, you can tell.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.500]   It's different between keynote and other--
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.500]   Absolutely.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   But how it handles the font.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.940]   It's just a different way of anti-aliasing spacing.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.660]   Everything else is just a little bit better.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:00.660]   And it gives it a higher gravity to it.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.660]   And so that's the thing.
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.140]   When you pay attention to that level of detail--
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.260]   And again, I think that a lot of folks that use Apple products are either consciously or
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.700]   unconscious or just used to that.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.180]   That's how everything works.
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.180]   You know?
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.580]   I got to take a break.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:13.580]   I want to come back.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:20.900]   I really do want to delve into a little bit iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.940]   And some of the features that you're looking forward to, James, and things that you've
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.060]   noticed, we kind of go deeper on that.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.620]   But it's really great to have James Thompson here.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:35.380]   Legendary Apple designer and developer, creator of Pete Kalkin, and Pete DICE.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.020]   He's the P-man.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.020]   And we're glad to have him.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.220]   I think we need to change that.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.140]   That's not probably what you want to have in your lower third.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.500]   Also Andy Inako is here.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.340]   He's the G-man.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.540]   And Alex Lindsey.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.540]   He is-- I don't know what, man.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:58.300]   But we have the entire Justice League United here on the show for you today.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.100]   Our show brought to you by Melissa.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:08.340]   The M-man, a leading global data quality identity verification and address management
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.700]   solutions provider.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.700]   They're the ones.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.820]   They've been doing this since, believe it or not, longer than James has been doing Pete
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.700]   Kalkin's 1985.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.900]   Specializing in global intelligence solutions so that organizations can unlock accurate data
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.540]   for a more compelling customer view.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:27.620]   And you know what?
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.220]   Every year they get the awards.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:37.260]   G2 is once again named Melissa's Clean Suite and Data Quality Suite leaders by G2, the
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.620]   leading peer-to-peer software platform.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:46.340]   In the 2023 data quality and address verification spring report, also named Momentum Leader and
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:50.700]   high performer in the same reports across the small business, mid-market and enterprise
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:51.700]   segments.
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:57.100]   Melissa has received many recognitions, including good partner, easiest to do business with,
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.420]   easiest setup, highest user adoption, and easiest admin.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:05.500]   If you're a Melissa customer, you know Melissa definitely deserves that.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.020]   If you're not, you should know what Melissa can do.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.580]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.180]   Melissa is also very affordable, I should mention.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:17.900]   They ranked highly in the price category for Clean Suite, Data Quality Suite across many
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:18.900]   segments.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:24.100]   That's because Melissa firmly believes you should make money on data quality.
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.740]   It shouldn't cost you more than it saves.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:33.780]   So they continue to offer the best affordable solutions for data quality and address verification.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:39.100]   I think everybody kind of intuitively understands that bad data in your contact list can cost
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.700]   you money.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:47.300]   Did you know poor data quality can cost organizations an average of $15 million a year?
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.540]   And that number goes up every year.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:52.260]   Bad data stays in your system.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:56.260]   Melissa will help you eliminate waste and lost opportunities from incorrect mailings.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:01.380]   It'll improve your customer satisfaction with seamless real-time identity verification
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   tools.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:07.460]   If you have to comply with various federal and international guidelines, you know that
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:11.780]   sometimes customer verification is a problem is a friction point for your customers.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.140]   Not with Melissa.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:16.860]   Their real-time identity verification tools are fast and effective.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:21.620]   They have matching and deduplication tools, which will help you eliminate dupes.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.740]   I tell this story all the time.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:30.020]   A restoration hardware is 75 of their catalog, same name and address, same catalog every
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.020]   six months.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:36.780]   And it was bizarre because I know those catalogs, beautiful four-color thick catalog must have
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.220]   cost them a ton.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.220]   What a waste.
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.060]   Plus, it kind of irritates the customers, right?
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:47.660]   You want a single high-quality customer record that links all the customer touch points.
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.540]   So without duplication, right?
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.620]   So you know everything you need to know about your customer to serve them without annoying
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.620]   them.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:59.140]   You'll be glad to know Melissa complies with the U.S. Postal Services Move Update Requirements,
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.820]   which means you're getting the most current address data because they process through
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.980]   the USPS's national change of address database.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   But that's just one of many ways, Melissa, make sure your data is accurate.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.740]   Since 1985, and don't worry, your data is safe with Melissa.
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.620]   They continually undergo independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to data
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.660]   security, privacy, and of course, compliance.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.780]   They're SOC2 compliant, HIPAA compliant, GDPR compliant.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.980]   You can use Melissa with confidence.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.900]   Make sure your customer contact date is up to date.

[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.820]   We thank you so much for supporting Mac break weekly.
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.300]   You support us when you use that address though.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.700]   Make sure you use that address so they know you start here.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:03.700]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:14.940]   I love it that you have the 1987, '97 Apple human interface guidelines on your desk right
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.940]   there.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.820]   I think it's like '91, '91.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.820]   '91.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:24.100]   I've got a stack of all the original books that I go on.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   I love those.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.860]   Because I just couldn't throw them away.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.060]   Did you start with Pascal?
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.060]   Or you did?
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:37.940]   It was Pascal that was our university taught as the language and we used Think Pascal.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:38.940]   Think great.
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.940]   Pascal was very fast.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.700]   I love the Macintosh programmers workshop though.
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:48.140]   That was an amazing tool, an IDE that I don't think has ever been surpassed.
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.820]   I used that for 68,000 assembler.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.180]   What's the real answer?
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:16:00.700]   I used that for I ported programming language compiler to that as an MPW tool.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.100]   Yes, that was something.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.700]   I think Pascal was a nice simple thing.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:07.820]   The debugger in Think Pascal was one of the best.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:11.540]   I believe one of the people who worked on Think Pascal was Rich Segal.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.340]   Oh, BB Edit file.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.340]   No, that's right.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.700]   They were in Boston.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.700]   That's right.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:25.140]   That's where I got started and we were doing our coursework at university in Think Pascal.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:29.740]   I realized that the copy of Think Pascal that they gave us had all the Mac toolbook stuff
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.740]   with it.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.620]   I was like, "Hey, I could actually write an app with this."
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:42.060]   So I went out and I bought inside Mac one, two, I think I got like one, two, three and
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:47.140]   six and I missed or seven and I missed some critical things.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.900]   That's the first version of Peacock.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:53.940]   If you ran it on a color machine, bad things happened.
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:58.460]   But yeah, it was like I bought all those books at vast expense.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.580]   And they'll just start for the summer.
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.140]   A huge use of shelf space too.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.700]   Yeah, well, they're still there.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.860]   Apple's seven foot shelf right there.
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:19.420]   But yeah, it was, I don't want to say it's the best Apple documentation has ever been because
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.500]   that is mean to the people who are currently doing documentation.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.300]   It's pretty darn good.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.140]   It was really consistent and solid.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.620]   First, Toggazini and Scott Canaster and that group, they were so good.
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:40.100]   Not just that as objects, as bound paperback books, they're just so handsome to...
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.780]   They're definitely designed to be pulled off the shelf and splayed in stacks on top of
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.380]   on top and layers on top of your desk as you work your way through a problem.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.900]   But man, there's just something about the binding of those books that even when they
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.460]   were really, really out of date, it's like, I can't get rid of these.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.900]   It's like a leather bound book of poetry.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.700]   It's a first edition.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:06.300]   It's like, it's like a beautiful edition of James Joyce Ulysses.
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:09.700]   I know I will never open this, but I just enjoy holding it.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.860]   Exactly.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:15.140]   You use Swift now entirely in Xcode?
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.780]   Nope.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:20.100]   So I'm using...
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:27.700]   Pee-Calc was written in Pascal, hand converted to C, a C++ wrapper around that, then an objective
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.980]   C wrapper around that, then a Swift wrapper around that.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:37.580]   The analogy that I always use with Pee-Calc is if you remember Star Trek, the motion picture
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:43.860]   where they discover that the enormous entity that is threatening them, like right at the
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.420]   center of it is the original Voyager probe.
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.420]   Voyager.
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:50.180]   And then the song is just layers around it.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.580]   That is what Pee-Calc is.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.940]   So some of...
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.340]   A lot of my code is objective C at this point.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:07.500]   And because Pee-Calc has been around long enough, some of it's rewritten, some of it
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.540]   are new stuff like widgets as all Swift and Swift UI, whatever.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:19.860]   But there's no real point in rewriting existing working code as you write new stuff, yes.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:25.260]   And when I did dice, dice was like...
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.940]   It was a spin off of the about screen from Pee-Calc.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.540]   And I was challenged by Jason Snell to make a dice rolling app.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:35.700]   And I decided I would make one and ship one in...
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:40.780]   I think I gave myself a week and I actually took you two weeks from new project to being
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:44.660]   on the app store was like two weeks.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:50.220]   But because I was reusing a lot of Pee-Calc code in that, that is also objective C and
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.900]   remains objective C.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:20:00.140]   So I'm a contradiction in that I simultaneously like to adopt new, exciting things as quickly
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.140]   as possible.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:06.900]   And I'm also extremely conservative in some of the technology choices I make because now
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.900]   this stuff works.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:11.060]   If it works, don't change it, yeah.
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:16.180]   I mean, you must have to write a lot of glue code to keep it all working together.
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.380]   No, it's not actually too bad.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:23.060]   You can call Swift and Objective-C if you can interoperate between them very easily.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:30.380]   And you can have one bit of your app being Swift UI and one bit just regular UI kit.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.980]   It's actually pretty good for that sort of stuff.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:41.420]   So I actually don't want to kind of stick with 3D because you really did do an early
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.900]   3D app.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:52.420]   So you were right on that bandwagon from day one.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:57.340]   Are the interfaces for VisionOS similar, different, better, worse?
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.780]   It's pretty similar.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:06.580]   What they're trying to encourage developers to use is Swift UI, which they've extended
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:10.940]   out for 3D stuff.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:17.780]   But you can still port over your UI kit app as far as I can tell.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:28.900]   And the reality kit is what they have been using for AR stuff previously, which exists
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:31.500]   and has been extended in--
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   So none of that breaks.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.900]   All of that stuff is continuing with the dishes.
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:39.220]   I mean, I think there's going to be things that I need to do with DICE.
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:44.940]   I'll need to enhance things because, like I said before, the scene kit, which is the
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:50.060]   main thing DICE uses, isn't a thing that you can really use for 3D.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:55.660]   But I have this reality kit test mode, which I use for doing the AR stuff.
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:03.460]   I know that I can build that out fairly easily and have something that will work in 3D.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:12.820]   I mean, I haven't dug deep into things like the hand gesture stuff and how--
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.620]   Will I be able to pick up a DICE with my hand?
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.340]   Oh, that would be cool.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.340]   Roll it.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.580]   And I think that might be possible.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:27.980]   You have to look at the die and then go with your fingers.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.900]   Can you create new gestures or do you have to use their existing?
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:39.020]   No, I think you can use stuff and you can use direct interaction with objects.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.020]   Interesting.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:45.980]   I don't think it's going to be a case that you have to do it like the sort of pinching
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.220]   your fingers together looking at stuff.
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:51.780]   I think there could be some hands-on stuff.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:55.540]   That's an interesting-- there's the questions I'm going to find really, really interesting
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:23:00.300]   where I think that sometimes you get sort of like an inner-- you get into a problem
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:05.780]   where it's like interface skeuomorphism where, hey, if I want to roll the dice on this actual
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:09.340]   real-world table in front of me, the obvious way to do it is that I'm going to have-- I'm
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:13.500]   going to let the user reach out with their hand and pick up the dice and roll them when
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.740]   that could be cool and fun.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.580]   But when you get to the part where people like this app and they actually want to use
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.580]   it, maybe they would just rather have like a hovering widget that they can just tap on
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.980]   and then like a dice cup simply raises up on its own as if magically shakes it and then
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:28.980]   dumps itself out.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.380]   I mean, I think that is the case.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:36.380]   And I think like if you were actually with your Vision Pro on playing Dungeons and Dragons
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.700]   over FaceTime, let us say.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:44.860]   You might just want to have a little window off the side with your dice by peak out in
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.260]   it and you tap a button or adjust your attitude and roll the dice.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:56.420]   You probably don't want to be sitting in a cave surrounded by dragons.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:03.020]   While that would be cool, I don't know that that is like the-- I don't think people specifically
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:08.420]   roll dice or do maths as a singular task.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:09.740]   It doesn't need to be immersive.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.060]   I don't need to believe that the dice are there.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:18.300]   But on the other hand, would it be cool as a mode you could do?
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:26.580]   Like a demon just simply spawns from like a fiery pit on the middle of the table.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:32.940]   It throws, crushes Orcs into the shapes of cubes, throws them away as they scream, and
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.940]   then, oh, look, eight.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   Refreshing.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:42.540]   I mean, it's like what I like is taking like the most sophisticated, as I say, consumer
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:49.420]   product ever with all these super high-end processors and all this stuff and basically
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:52.500]   generating a number between one and 20.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.260]   Who's going to say your sight even lower?
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.220]   Who's going to have the first flashlight app for Vision?
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:02.780]   I mean, it happens when the die rolls off the table.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.580]   Well, I mean, it should roll off.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.580]   I've got that currently.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:10.300]   In the current version, you can roll dice on your table and they will fall off onto the
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.300]   floor.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.820]   And do they keep rolling when they hit the floor and then?
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.820]   They do.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:21.340]   Because even on the iPhone, when it's got the-- what do you call it?
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.340]   The depth indicator stuff.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:25.340]   Lidar.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.340]   Yes.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:31.300]   It's scanning the room and it's building a 3D model of the surfaces that it sees.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:36.940]   So long as it's seen it, if you roll the dice, it will fall off your table naturally
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.900]   and will roll under a chair.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:44.900]   And there is-- like even just doing that through a phone or iPad screen, which is not
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:50.660]   the way to do AR, there is something magical about having a dice roll out-- roll under
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.660]   a table.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.660]   Because--
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.900]   It should.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:54.900]   That's what dice does.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:01.820]   And then just like every other family board game or family game system, after you've had
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:08.740]   this app for six months, nominally, one of the dice has rolled under the sofa but no
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.940]   one saw it, so they have to get another die from another game that doesn't quite match
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:12.940]   the other set.
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:18.460]   Maybe I sell them another dice for 99 cents to replace the one that's in the system.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.460]   I mean--
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.460]   So many opportunities.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.340]   You've got to pay for that vision somehow.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:26.340]   Oh gosh.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:31.460]   I need to sell 3,500 dice immediately.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.580]   I do think tabletop games might end up being a big category for the Vision Pro.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:44.420]   I mean, I can see the stuff with the virtual tabletop in front of you, where you've got
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:47.260]   your little figures or whatever.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.420]   It makes sense.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:55.100]   And if you can do it, but the thought of trying to get together half a dozen people, all who
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:02.060]   have 3,500 pound headsets to play D&D in the same room as you or whatever.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:06.900]   I think there's a lot of people that will buy the headset that might have played D&D
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:07.900]   in the past.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:08.900]   I think there might be--
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:13.060]   There's a venn diagram with a very large wedge in the middle.
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:19.380]   I think Steve Wozniak, who had a league of Segway polo players in the Segway was twice
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:21.220]   as much at the time.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:28.300]   So I think it'll be a thin layer of people, but there will be some who would like to play
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:29.300]   tabletop games.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.740]   It probably isn't a money maker.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:38.940]   If you can find a way to sell people unpainted minifigs and then sell them the virtual paint
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.180]   for that, I know a lot of people that--
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.180]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.700]   I have a second house right now, if not for all the lead they've got in closets.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:53.060]   There is genuinely-- I have seen a game which does exactly that, but you are buying figures
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.900]   and painting them and playing the game in virtually.
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:00.660]   In the long run, that's going to be the bane of 3D environments.
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:06.140]   Just as it was the bane of Second Life, which is when it suddenly becomes an economy and
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:11.780]   you've got bucks and you're spending zuck bucks for designs.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:18.660]   I trust Apple to more extent than I trust, like--
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.660]   Absolutely.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:20.660]   Or somebody else to do this.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:21.660]   Absolutely.
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.660]   Absolutely.
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:30.700]   I mean, you are going to get the equivalent of the free in quotes games that you download
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.860]   that you have to buy your gems or your diamonds or whatever.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.100]   That's because--
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.860]   That's where the money is.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:46.140]   Well, it's also that the whole App Store economy is just a weird thing.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.260]   And actually making money is difficult.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.380]   I don't say it's easy, but it's easier if you've been around for 30 years and people
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.020]   know your name and your products.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:02.900]   But coming to stuff, if you've got an app that you're launching and you're trying to
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:06.780]   get it in front of people, that's a really hard thing to do.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:09.220]   And then make money out of it.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:17.700]   I do have my miniature Leo Laporte for Hero Forge all ready for our game.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:23.060]   So when you-- and this comes pre-painted, I've got to tell you, but if you wanted to
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.620]   change the colors, you could do that.
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:28.740]   I like the fact that it comes with an iPhone.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.940]   A microphone and an older iPhone.
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:33.420]   Because I think this is an old-- did you do this, Patrick?
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.420]   Who did this?
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.420]   This is very nice.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:39.260]   I'm sitting on an exercise ball, Patrick.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.820]   Very nice.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.580]   Let's see.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.780]   How about Sonoma?
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.500]   Anything-- I wasn't completely clear.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:51.660]   Are the widgets on Sonoma the same as the widgets on iPad as an iOS?
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.580]   Those are all the same.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:30:01.500]   And even today with DICE's widgets, because it's a catalyst app, but literally it's the
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.820]   same code running.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:05.100]   So it's SwiftUI everywhere.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.460]   It's all very similar.
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:07.460]   Good.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.300]   And yeah, you can put the widgets on the desktop.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.300]   I know.
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:12.300]   I really like that.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.220]   I really like that.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.900]   That's something other operating systems have had.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.380]   For some time, I've used Conkey on Linux.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:26.020]   Windows flirted with it under-- and then decided this is too much of a hazard.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.780]   I could see them bringing it back now that now that Apple's doing it.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:30.060]   So I look forward to that.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.820]   I think it's going to be a nice feature.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:37.140]   I mean, there was a few little things that I really liked, like being able to turn web
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.860]   pages into standalone web apps.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:42.100]   How close is that to the full PWA?
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.340]   Or is that just Apple's version of--
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:51.820]   No, this is just-- I think this is just basically-- it's just wrapping a Safari window
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:56.540]   into an app that you can layer amongst other apps.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.540]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.740]   And it's going to happen to the doc and things like that.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:06.900]   It seems like the ideal kind of thing that you can constrain Facebook or something like
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.140]   that into.
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:16.900]   So it's kept securely away from everything else.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:20.620]   And I think that I was looking at the list of things.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:22.980]   There's nothing that's amazing.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:31.700]   I mean, the game mode stuff and the more interesting commitment to doing game stuff.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:34.980]   I find that interesting.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:37.380]   Well, I think we've been talking about it.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:42.660]   I'm very pleased to see Apple wrote a fairly long 20,000-- according to Christina Warren,
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:50.500]   who wrote an article about it-- 20,000 line addition to the crossover line library for
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:58.340]   Mac that allows you to run DirectX 12 games at a fairly good pace on the new Apple Silicon
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.340]   laptops.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:05.940]   Yeah, I would say the-- have you with that?
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.660]   Is I don't think Apple intends anyone to ship games like this.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:14.860]   No, they say it's to test your game to see if you could port it to metal.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:18.460]   But you got to think they're going to be people who are going to say, fine, I'll just take
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.460]   it the way it is.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.500]   Thank you very much.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.140]   I don't think it's for that.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.380]   I don't even know if Apple would let you do that.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:34.740]   I think it-- I know people who work for Mac game porting things, and a lot of them have
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:40.420]   internal libraries to do this kind of already to convert the DirectX calls.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:47.860]   I'm not 100% sure, and I would need to look this up, whether Apple contributed the changes
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:54.940]   that they made to this back to the open source project, or whether they are keeping them
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:55.940]   to themselves.
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:33:01.700]   I certainly heard some people complaining that they weren't sharing what they had done.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:06.180]   I can't speak with authority to whether they did or not.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:13.100]   It's interesting, but I think it's more a case of here's your game running.
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:16.700]   Imagine how much better it would be if you actually spent some time and you started this
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:19.460]   to metal.
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:24.100]   The fact that people have run fairly modern games--
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:30.180]   Here's Diablo 4 running on a MacBook at a pretty decent frame rate.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:33.980]   This is around 60 frames a second right now.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:38.220]   You can see the frame rate up in the upper right-hand corner using this crossover or
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.380]   wine library.
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.100]   That's pretty playable.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:47.940]   This is an ultra level too, ultra graphics.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:49.940]   It's good stuff, and it's interesting.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:52.900]   It does show what the performance is.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:59.620]   I like the fact that Apple is leaning into games a bit more, because certainly they've
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:12.020]   had a reputation for, let's say, the last 30 years of not being great with games.
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:17.500]   Even the stuff that they showed, they had Death Stranding, which is a two, three year
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.500]   old game.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.340]   Yeah, put Jima.
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:22.580]   No Man's Sky.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:23.740]   I love No Man's Sky.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:29.220]   It's a great game, but it's been out for years.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.220]   Right.
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:33.380]   No one buys a Mac to play AAA games.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.380]   You'd be silly.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.380]   Yeah, I mean, that's not--
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:41.220]   I think honestly, I've been running a Mac and a separate games console to play games
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:43.260]   on for literally 30 years.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:47.060]   Yeah, get an Xbox or a PlayStation if you really want to do that.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:52.860]   I mean, Microsoft used to be the enemy, I have to say, but the Xbox and Game Pass is
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.860]   pretty sweet.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.100]   It's a good deal.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:58.820]   What game do you play these days?
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:34:59.860]   What game am I playing these days?
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:05.620]   I have put 150 hours into the New Zelda game, and I'm probably about halfway through it.
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.340]   Tears of the Kingdom, baby.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:09.380]   We now know who's shedding those tears.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.380]   All the loads of spouses.
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:12.380]   I would say--
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:14.900]   Well, no, because my space--
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:15.900]   Did she play it with the--
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:16.900]   90 hours?
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.020]   No, she's-- we've got one switch and one TV.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020]   Dear.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.020]   So we have to--
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.020]   It's a fight over.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.020]   It's a share.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.020]   Oh.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020]   Well, it's not fighting.
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.020]   It's like, now is your turn now.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.020]   It's my turn.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.020]   It's your turn, dear.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:34.180]   But so it's-- I think everyone-- everyone plays games now.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:35.180]   It's not just men.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.020]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:38.020]   Everybody plays games.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.020]   You bet.
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:40.020]   The--
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.020]   Of some sort.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:46.460]   I would say-- I would say Tears of the Kingdom is probably up there for one of the
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.460]   best games ever made.
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:51.740]   It is so good.
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:56.500]   And yeah, that is what is taking a lot of my time.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:00.100]   I hope to try and finish it before WWDC and I failed.
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.500]   Well, you're just a punter.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:07.500]   You haven't put anywhere near the number of hours in that it's going to take.
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:12.020]   Here, by the way, full credit to Andy Enoco because he used Hero Forge, which was one
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.260]   of your picks of the week to do a 3D Jim Dowrymple.
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:17.260]   Wow.
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:21.180]   Beer bottles and guitar included.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.380]   I'm not sure there's enough beer bottles there and not one.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.620]   Well, it was early.
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:26.620]   It was early in the day.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.340]   But the beard is definitely on point.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.260]   Very much fear the beard.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:33.620]   Yeah, I forgot about that area.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.580]   How many accessories you can add.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:41.380]   You got to imagine that every time someone--
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:46.940]   someone emails or cuts feedback saying, hey, I really, really wanted to have a Devo hat
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.940]   on my character.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:48.940]   OK.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.940]   You're OK?
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.540]   We added a Devo hat.
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.420]   It's just a plan.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:59.020]   I do find that Hero Forge, even if I haven't actually had anything made yet, it is really
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:02.020]   entertaining just to sit there and make these things.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.780]   Oh, well, we have a fellow Hero Forger.
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:09.100]   Wouldn't it be great if that would be wonderful VR app?
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:13.820]   If just the idea of I just want to create figures, and I don't want to know how to sculpt,
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:20.860]   I don't necessarily want to know how to paint, just show me sample poses that I can start
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:26.420]   with accessories and paints that colors I can add to it and just have this object on
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:34.100]   a shelf in VR that I can just admire and just keep adding a collection of thumbles or spoons.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.060]   That would be super fun.
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:43.940]   I think, technically, they could have a website with 3D content in it.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:46.180]   You could just go to their website and click on the Facebook.
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:47.180]   Microsoft did that.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.180]   For briefly, Microsoft--
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:49.180]   Show me the view.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.180]   It's got into this.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:57.220]   I wonder if you can export these Hero Forges as USDZ and USDZ format or no, probably not.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.020]   They probably don't want to give you that because they don't want you just taking them
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.660]   away and printing them yourself.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.660]   Right.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.660]   Right.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:12.500]   I could see exactly that kind of stuff working really well in 3D, sitting with a giant figurine
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:15.140]   of Jim Dowrymple in front of you.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.140]   Glaring at you.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140]   Well, since--
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.700]   Come on, come on, we've got a post, we've got a post.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:28.260]   Since we talked last, didn't Alex, you would know, who released an iOS app?
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:33.100]   Was it-- that lets you do-- because Anthony came in and scanned me.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.100]   For game characters?
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:35.100]   No, for iOS.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.100]   Mother's Polycam.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.100]   There's the one that--
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.620]   There's no one that just came out.
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:40.620]   Like human cam or humanity.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.140]   Oh, I can't remember what it was.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:47.940]   Well, there's-- you know, and the one that's starting to come up now is metahuman.
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.260]   Metahuman, that was it.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:51.620]   Who's that from?
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.060]   That's from Epic.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:57.500]   So that's in the Unreal Engine, which means it's not going to be helpful.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.140]   Well, it's in Unreal.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:03.060]   I mean, it's the same company, but metahuman kind of lives in its own world.
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.380]   I'm sure it's using part of the engine.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:09.460]   But metahuman is pretty impressive on a whole bunch of layers.
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.300]   For a long time, we could only make things that look like kind of like somebody, because
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.660]   you'd pull dials.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:17.940]   Now we can do photogrammetry and actually get ahead and replace the head and metahuman
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:19.340]   and have it all map.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:22.700]   And the big thing there is that you can animate it with your phone and stuff like that.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:24.300]   So it's kind of-- it's slick.
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.540]   I mean, Epic's doing a lot of great stuff.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:30.500]   They are going to be most likely on the outside looking in.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:34.140]   I don't think that Apple and Epic are talking.
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.140]   I think they might have been--
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:36.140]   I'm talking terms.
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:41.820]   And so that puts them at a huge disadvantage to Unity, because Unity, I think, is-- I mean,
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:43.060]   obviously, they were in WWC.
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:46.540]   So there's a lot of embrace, apples embracing, a lot of what Unity's doing.
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:50.940]   And again, I don't think that Epic and Apple are in on speaking terms.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:54.740]   But you can still build the latest Unreal 5.
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.300]   Whatever on the Mac.
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:57.300]   It works.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.300]   You can.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.460]   But if you don't have access-- if you don't have Unity's access--
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.460]   It's like--
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:03.460]   It's like--
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:09.460]   It seems like that is just going to be a political thing.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:14.940]   But I think the people doing the technology, you know, as we say, like this thing for metahuman
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:18.740]   for doing the facial animation and stuff, running on an iPhone.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.820]   So it's not like Epic is saying, we shall never touch another--
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.820]   No, no.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.620]   I don't think Apple and Epic wants to do that.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.300]   And I definitely don't think the Unreal folks want to do it.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.300]   I think that they're just not going to get a lot of Apple.
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:33.860]   It's not that your Apple's doing anything to them.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:38.140]   I just think that Apple's not going to step-- Apple's probably not going to step out of
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.620]   its way to help Epic at this point until they drop their lawsuits.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:45.060]   So I think that's going to probably be the-- probably how that's going to work.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.460]   So it'll be interesting to see.
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.380]   I mean, Unity fills a big gap.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:53.340]   What Epic was filling until Epic did the lawsuit, Unity is filling a big gap for Apple because
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:54.340]   they can't--
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.460]   They can't build all those tools immediately.
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:41:03.100]   So to fill in the gaps here, apparently you can export into STL for $5 from Hero Forge
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:07.700]   and you can download it into Unity 3D format.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.220]   So that's interesting.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.820]   So Hero Forge could be used to decide.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:14.180]   So what I'm hearing is we're going to make a game with Jim Dalrymple.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:21.900]   I think we are going to have a Jim Dalrymple tabletop game.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:23.500]   I'd like him in a chess set, actually.
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.220]   That'd be a lot of fun.
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.420]   It would be a Benz and bottles or something.
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:30.020]   Yeah, the bonds are beer bottles.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.740]   And Jim's the king, obviously.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.180]   Maybe we'll make-- I don't know.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:35.260]   Who should be the queen?
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:37.460]   But that would be kind of fun.
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:43.300]   And Anthony tells me he was using Reality Scan to capture me and then he's going to rebuild
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:48.140]   it within MetaHuman to create a MetaHuman Leo.
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.860]   So you can now, I guess, do photogrammetry with real people.
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:54.220]   And Reality Scan is also owned by Epic.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.820]   Epic, OK.
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.020]   Alex, what do you think of the idea of Apple buying Unreal?
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.500]   It seems to--
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.380]   Because it's not buying Unreal, it's buying Epic.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:07.060]   And Epic--
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:08.900]   Epic's with a lot of money right now.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:11.420]   This thing called Fortnite, you ever hear of it.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:16.620]   I mean, the problem with both Unity and Epic, they weren't worth a lot five or eight years
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:20.620]   ago, but now they're both in the plus $15 billion valuation range.
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:22.140]   It's not that Apple can't afford it.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:23.940]   It would just be a huge--
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:26.620]   I mean, I think that--
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:31.700]   And it would be hard for them to incorporate those two things together.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:32.460]   But yeah.
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:39.740]   Tim Sweeney made in the first year of Fortnite himself earn $7 billion.
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.380]   So it's going to be costly, I think.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:50.580]   And the thing is that the Unreal Engine is obviously very connected to what Epic wants
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.940]   to do, which is the whole lawsuit is over.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.220]   They want to build marketplaces.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.140]   They want people to do exactly what we were talking about earlier, which is sell items
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:04.860]   to each other in a metaverse and sell houses and cars and all kinds of other things.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.340]   But they don't want to give Apple 30% of every sale.
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:10.420]   So their entire business model is wrapping up.
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:11.420]   I mean, Apple could afford it.
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:15.260]   They've got the cash in the line around.
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:16.860]   Oh, no, they could.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:19.020]   It was for sale.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.340]   Tim Sweeney probably would not sell on point of principle.
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:23.300]   Well, exactly.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:27.460]   This is the company that fought each other viciously in court.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:29.020]   It still is, as far as I know.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.460]   The battle continues.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:38.540]   Epic Games net worth $32 billion, according to the last valuation in April of last year.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:41.460]   Apple could afford $32 billion.
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:42.740]   Come on, Apple.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:46.180]   But yeah, you'd have to do a hostile takeover, right?
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:50.100]   Are they, I don't even know if they're public, to be honest.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.220]   Anyway, that's a silly, wasteful time.
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.060]   We've got, we've got Paul McCartney here.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:44:00.060]   Let's ask some important questions.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:05.780]   You guys, anything, Alex, are you actively looking at developing for the Vision Pro?
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:06.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:07.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:08.780]   Okay.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.780]   I'm already in production.
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:16.060]   So yeah, so we're, I mean, mostly we're looking at, you know, I'm mostly looking at
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.660]   the video, the video end of things.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:20.580]   So, you know, how to deliver right now, it looks like we're still going to be kind of
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:21.580]   clamped.
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:25.540]   When we say that Apple didn't cut any corner, I mean, didn't, you know, wasn't constrained
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:26.540]   by price.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:30.860]   I think they were constrained by either weight or heat or something because most of us think
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:35.460]   that the naturally, eventually want to get to 120 frames per second, six or eight K
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:36.460]   per eye.
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:37.620]   They're at 90 now.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:43.220]   This first headset and 90 is kind of a weird, from a video perspective, it's a weird frame
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.220]   rate.
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.500]   It does 96 or 24 frames.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.020]   So if you're playing a movie, it'll do 96 so that it can give you whole frames.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.020]   Right.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.020]   You know, it doesn't cut those frames off.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.820]   So, so it's 4X the 24.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.460]   The, so that's there.
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:59.140]   What's, what's, otherwise everything's 90 frame, 90 frame makes a big difference for
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.460]   3D when it's animating in front of you, but we can't produce video at 90 frames a second.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.020]   So we get produced at 120.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.020]   What's the screen?
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.180]   Is it 4K screen?
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:13.260]   They've been a little squirrely about the exact exact resolution, but it does appear to
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.260]   us.
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:18.540]   You, some kind of four, some version of 4K or close to it.
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:20.180]   So yeah, so it's, it's going.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.740]   And you can't watch movies.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:25.580]   So it has to be some way, reasonable way to confirm.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:30.700]   Not only, not only can you watch movies, you can watch them in 3D and it's going to
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:32.820]   be a great platform for 3D.
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.820]   That's what the demo to Avatar.
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.980]   The way of, well, the Wawa.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:37.980]   And Avatar is a good example.
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:42.540]   Avatar is a 48 frame per second film, you know, so they, you know, they talk about being
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:43.860]   48 underwater in 24.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:44.860]   It's 48.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:46.940]   And then they just double the frames when they're above above the water.
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.460]   And then they go back to single frame.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:49.460]   This is 38.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:56.780]   And so, and so the, but it's a 48 frame, which is you can't play that back in a lot of places.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:00.580]   I mean, you know, your average TVs don't know what to do with that and so on.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:04.820]   So the headset's actually going to be really great for watching things like Avatar.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:08.820]   And I think that you're going to, it's going to bring back, there's a whole bunch of us
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:11.900]   now that are suddenly trying to find all those 3D rigs.
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:14.740]   You know, I was just talking to someone who has a whole bunch of rigs and he's like,
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:17.940]   yeah, I can't sell these ones anymore because they're under demand and I got to use them
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:18.940]   for production.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:19.940]   I can sell these one.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.300]   You must have someone in the shells behind you there.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:24.860]   I don't have, I have one.
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:25.860]   You know, this one right here.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:27.060]   That's a 360 set.
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:29.420]   That's a, the, oh, so.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.420]   Oh, so.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:35.020]   And so the, but it's not going to be the quality that we would want to, you know, shoot for
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.020]   these now.
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:41.340]   So, so a lot of us are looking at things like the R5C, which is the Canon, Canon's R5C
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.220]   with a, they have a stereo lens on it.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.220]   Yeah, I've seen it.
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.220]   Do 180.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:47.180]   But that would be feeding the spaces.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:52.380]   So you'd feed that into a space environment rather than the volume or window environment.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.220]   But really when you're watching movies, you probably watch it in the window environment.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:59.300]   And the advantage of that is that you can shoot rectilinear videos.
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:04.380]   So we can, if we fill the video, fill the video frame, we can go ahead and shoot, quote
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:07.300]   unquote, traditional 3D, not 180.
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:11.860]   And, and so then, but the problem there is that when you start doing that, we have all
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:14.980]   kinds of problems, like convergence and where those cameras are.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:18.860]   And those, those become these really complicated, you know, rigs.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:22.540]   And so that's what we're, we're all trying to find who has rigs that are still sitting.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:23.540]   There's two of them in our building.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.500]   We're trying to get them to rebuild them again.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:28.660]   Because they used to be, that used to be the next big thing.
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:29.660]   And then it wasn't.
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:31.660]   So there's all these.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:33.060]   There's millions of millions and millions of dollars were spent on these rigs.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:34.740]   I mean, these rigs, like you can get a rig now.
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.380]   It's like it was $60,000 or $70,000.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.580]   You can buy them now for about 10.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:44.580]   And there's a bunch of people that are in discussions about buying those at 10.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:49.100]   And, and, and if you email me afterwards and say, who's, who's selling these for 10?
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.100]   I can't tell you because I'm trying to buy.
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:53.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:54.100]   So, so, so, yeah.
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.100]   Exactly.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.460]   So, so the, but, but those are, you know, it's suddenly everybody's interested in 3D again,
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:00.460]   because these will be incredible headsets for it.
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:04.380]   And the big thing is, is that when someone's been $3,500 on a, on a headset, they're likely
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:06.420]   to buy a lot of things that get made for it.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:10.860]   So if you're, you know, there's this kind of the, the, the, in the first couple months
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:15.060]   that these headsets go out, and really the first year, there's going to be a lot of demand
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:20.060]   for the next new thing in, you know, I mean, you can definitely move all your apps to it,
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:23.100]   but something that fully takes advantage of the headset should be pretty interesting.
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:24.500]   We're going to go ahead.
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.300]   Questions that go ahead.
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:29.060]   I was just going to say one of the questions that I had about the headset, which I haven't
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:32.460]   really seen answered is so you can record.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.740]   Like when you've got the thing on, you can record what you're seeing.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:40.740]   And then later playback that stuff in a, in a window.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:43.100]   It's more, send it to somebody else to watch it as well.
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.340]   They have to have a vision pro to get the full stereoscopic version.
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:54.020]   Yes, but it's, it's more the kind of like, they seem to be moving, they seem to be positioning
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:59.980]   it as you're watching, you watch this memory back in a window, yeah, rather than experiencing
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:00.980]   it full.
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:01.980]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:02.980]   I see.
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:03.980]   I don't, I don't.
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:08.580]   Cause that's, that's a, it's a much, from a resolution perspective, it's much more complicated.
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:12.140]   And so I think that those cameras may not be able to, I mean, you, the cameras that need
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:16.860]   to do that may not be able to do the, the 180 at a, at a resolution that would be high,
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:19.660]   that would be quality high enough quality that would make it worth it.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:22.620]   So I think that that's probably why they're not a small fish.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:27.260]   I spread, spreading all of that hundred and 80 degrees out over 4k, let's say if it's
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.860]   capturing 4k wouldn't necessarily, it would probably look a little soft.
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:36.060]   So by, by, by pulling it in, they can get a higher quality for that, that window.
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:39.140]   And I'm going to guess that that's what they're going to do.
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:41.540]   And it's funny, you know, a lot of people talk about that, people aren't going to put
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.700]   the headsets on, but I mean, when I grew up, people were putting big cameras, they had
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:46.180]   big camcorders and everything else.
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:48.740]   This is just the next camcorder.
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:53.580]   And, and, but the other thing is I, I imagine version two will have better recording.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.020]   I mean, that would really be an important feature.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.100]   I would sell a lot of headsets too.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:59.500]   If you could only watch this.
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:02.780]   It was hands on one of my favorite features of Google Glass, just being able to just
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:08.300]   100% I just, if something cool is happening, just tap the side of the, of the, of the frames.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.740]   And now suddenly I'm watching it, but also recording it.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:11.740]   Okay.
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:12.740]   Okay.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:13.740]   Take a video.
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:16.420]   And I had, I have, I have shots of video of me like swinging my daughter in a circle
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.780]   around in a park, you know, with the, in, in which she's really small, which is much more
[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:23.260]   valuable now, but it was from that point of view.
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:28.500]   Now it, it was less, it would be less weird with the Google Glass of all things than it
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.500]   would be.
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.500]   Yes.
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:36.580]   But, but the, but I also, I'm just going to be blown away that by this iPhone 16, we
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:41.820]   don't have a camera set up in the iPhones that will shoot stereo for the headsets.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:46.860]   I, I think there's a 50 to 60% chance we'll see it in this camera that comes into the
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:50.660]   next one, given that they knew that this headset was coming.
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:56.180]   And I think it's probably 80% by the next year that we'll see the ability to do stereo
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.940]   acquisition in the camera in the iPhones.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.780]   It wouldn't take very much to do it.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.020]   I could see them do an extra high end phone.
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.820]   You know, like, it would be the pro.
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.060]   I think it would be the pro.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:07.900]   I think probably one above the pro.
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:11.060]   I think they would probably put that on, on something.
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:15.460]   I mean, literally it would be adding one more lens, like it'd be a quad instead of a,
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460]   instead of a thing.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:19.580]   And you could, that's all you, because you would have two lenses that are matching.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:23.820]   You don't have to spread it out because if you look at the hydrogen that, that red made,
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:28.540]   those lenses were, those sensors were right next to each other, which is not interocular
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.940]   distance, but still got enough data with, with computational photography to, it looked
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:34.940]   pretty good.
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:41.540]   I mean, the red stuff looked pretty stereo, even with sensors that were a centimeter apart.
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:45.980]   So these, the ones that on the phone would be two or three times as far apart as the
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:46.980]   red camera.
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:51.460]   So you could definitely generate 3D data relatively, especially with help from the
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.340]   LiDAR and everything else.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:58.020]   You'd probably be able to create some pretty great 3D data, but you could do it potentially
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:02.260]   with just computational photography right now with the current lenses that are there.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:04.540]   I would worry that it just wouldn't look right.
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:09.020]   You know, like you'd want two lenses that are identical, but, you know, Apple's got lots
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.980]   of engineers thinking about that, I'm sure.
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:14.740]   To me, it depends on how much more expensive would that second lens be or that additional
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.060]   lens be.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:20.020]   And would the, is there enough elasticity in what people are willing to spend for the
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.820]   pro model to say, Hey, I don't, I don't own these goggles.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:23.900]   I don't care about these goggles.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.060]   I don't want these goggles.
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:29.620]   What I would, I would much rather be able to do is afford another 256 gigabytes of
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:33.340]   storage, but no, I'm being forced to pay for this extra lens that I don't know if I'm
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.700]   going to actually use or not.
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:42.220]   But then you can have, you know, you've got this 3D movie of your daughter's fifth birthday
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.220]   party.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:47.340]   I don't know people that are buying the pro version that those of you that I know that
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:51.780]   are buying the pro version are not super connected to the price.
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:54.580]   You know, like, like, they can be in and I don't think that they're, I don't think
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:56.580]   that's, that's, that's why you buy the pro version.
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:53:00.260]   And so I think that, um, I think that they probably sell just as I don't think they'd
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:03.780]   sell any less, even if it was $200 more, I don't think it would matter.
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:04.780]   Okay.
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:09.020]   As someone who buys the pro version, like, I, if it was $200 more, I'd be like, Oh, there
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.100]   would be something else I can't buy.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:12.220]   It wouldn't be less memory or, or less of the camera.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:15.740]   It'd be something else in my life that I don't buy because I, because like one, I want
[01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:17.340]   a little more camera.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:21.380]   Your, your, your child doesn't get the birthday present, but you, I'm sorry.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.140]   You're not going to get a self-videy spin off money on this.
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:30.500]   I mean, oh, that, that is, that is a wonderfully weird family dynamic.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.540]   Say, kid, here's, here's, here's, here's the deal.
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.660]   Here's the choice I'm offering you.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:38.620]   I'll, can you either give you a Nintendo switch for your new Nintendo switch for your birthday
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:45.940]   or I can buy a $400 better than phone, which will make me want to spend more time with
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:48.980]   you because I'll be wanting to take more video of you.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:49.980]   That's right.
[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:53.300]   My kids hated it when I took pictures and video of them.
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.580]   And all I have now is a bunch of pictures with their hands in front of their face.
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:58.700]   Like, like, like, like paparazzi.
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:00.180]   You know, it's so funny.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:02.620]   We hated it when my dad took it, but we, we pride those.
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:03.860]   Oh, you're glad to have them now.
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:04.860]   Absolutely.
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:08.820]   In fact, I mean, I just said Abby a bunch of pictures from the, she said, do you have
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:10.740]   any pictures of us when we were kids?
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:11.740]   Said Abby.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:15.700]   I do, but your hands and running your face for 90%.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:19.820]   I mean, there's so few pictures of me as like a teenager because I have to like,
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.700]   completely a verse to any anything.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:25.100]   But now I want those pictures.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:26.100]   Sure.
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.860]   I was thinking about that the other day that like when my, when my parents died, that was
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:36.220]   the first time that all of their friends like dug up these super rare pictures.
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:39.500]   Oh, here, here is, here is my mom as a teenager just hanging out.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:43.700]   Here is my dad going skiing, which I never even like never, he didn't have a copy of
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:44.700]   it.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:45.700]   And I didn't ask about it.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.340]   It's such an amazing thing when you see your parents in their 20s and in their teens just
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.340]   hanging out.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.900]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:58.660]   Like 20 years from now when the, the TikTok kids and the Instagram kids and the VSCO kids,
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:02.180]   all of their children are going to be able to see to their, to their embarrassment.
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:07.180]   Like here is, here is my, here is my parents like me going out there having fun, occasionally
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.460]   doing things that are stupid.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:12.140]   But hey, look, they, they, they raise two kids and they're happy with their lives, even
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.180]   their third, 30 years later.
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:16.820]   I, that's going to be an interesting pivot point for society, I think.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:23.140]   A couple other stories before we get our picks of the week and wrap this thing up.
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:24.340]   Apple is facing some headwinds.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:30.020]   Japan has, is now pushing for both Apple and Google to add side loading in the Japanese
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:32.020]   versions of the App Stores.
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.100]   It's a new Japanese law.
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:38.660]   Apple's going to have to do it this summer, probably in the EU as, or next summer in the
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:40.340]   EU as well.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:46.180]   So, you know, it's going to be, it's going to be kind of this patchwork quilt of, of App
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:50.300]   Stores in different countries, probably not here.
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:53.020]   Although who knows what the FTC will do.
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:56:00.980]   The EU says all smartphones must have user replaceable batteries by 2027.
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:06.820]   Yeah, but they're not talking necessarily talking about like having the back removable
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:07.820]   in a car.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.820]   Those were the good old days.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:15.620]   They're basically, I loved it when I could buy three batteries for my Samsung S3.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:19.860]   And you know, but now we have, we have batteries that because of greater battery, we've been
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:22.460]   in chemistry that they, well, they, they last a couple of days.
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:25.420]   So now it's not quite, you know, if to worry about getting it through a day.
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:27.460]   There's, there's been a lot of pearl clutching about this one.
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:31.780]   This, the, the proposal again, doesn't say that you can't have waterproof phones anymore.
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.260]   You have to, you know, have externally pop off.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.700]   They're basically saying that do not be jerks and do anything.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:43.100]   The design that would make it, that would prohibit someone from opening the back and removing a,
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.180]   removing a battery and putting a new battery in.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.740]   So it's, it seems that, and also it's notable that they're not putting this.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:53.220]   They're not making this happen until 2027, which is like four years from now, which is
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:56.420]   almost exactly the cycle of design for a brand new model of phone.
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:00.780]   It's likely that Apple, in other words, will just make it, that you can, you know, take
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.540]   it to the Apple store and open it up.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:04.660]   I mean, you could do that now, right?
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:06.620]   It's, it's going to, it's going to be a third party.
[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:10.100]   I think there's, I think that the, the days where you're going to have to rent a special
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:13.700]   tool from Apple to replace a battery, that's the sort of stuff that they want to get rid
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:14.700]   of.
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.700]   Right.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.700]   Speak.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:17.700]   I think I fix a kit.
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.700]   I think we'll do it.
[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:20.700]   I think it's a recommendation to, I don't think it's finalized.
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:21.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.820]   Probably a little bit of a little bit of headwinds on, on exactly what year that might, that
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.460]   might occur and whether phones will even be a thing by the time that.
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:29.460]   Who knows?
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:31.460]   You'll have to be able to open your vision pro.
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:33.580]   Oh, no, there's no battery easily.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:34.580]   There's a battery outside.
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:38.460]   So you can easily replace the vision pro for battery because it's not even in the thing.
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:43.060]   The, the, we have to remember that USB C took 12, 12 years.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:48.340]   That's the problem with it is by the time it happens, who knows what the standards will
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.340]   be.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:51.020]   I think we're still going to need batteries in the future.
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.780]   I guess those are going away.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.780]   Okay.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:59.780]   Uh, Apple has expanded its self service repair program to include the iPhone 14 lineup and
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:04.180]   M2 maced MacBooks that'll start June 21st.
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:10.220]   And maybe even more importantly, they're changing that final system configuration validation
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:14.100]   step, which used to involve calling Apple on the phone.
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:18.540]   You'll be able to do that system configuration, that validation step, uh, by placing your
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:22.420]   device into diagnostics mode and following on screen prompts.
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:25.980]   So isn't that good to see that that this wasn't just phony baloney.
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:26.980]   We want to get around.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:29.980]   So I'm going to be able to get around complaints.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:30.980]   It really does seem like they're committed to this.
[01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:35.580]   And now I'm really, now I am willing to believe that this is part of what goes into design,
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:38.980]   that they make sure that this, that whenever they design in the future, we'll be able to
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:40.700]   conform to this, this, uh, this program.
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:46.860]   You'll still have to order the kit, a rental kit of very, very elaborate tools.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:50.620]   I wonder if this would satisfy the EU, you know, well, yeah, you can put a new battery.
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:52.660]   And if you have our super duper.
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:57.660]   Um, all right.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:00.660]   Is your, is your homework apartment rated for 250 volts?
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:02.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:08.340]   Um, let us take a little break.
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:11.660]   I think we could do some picks of the week coming up in just a bit.
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:13.860]   James Thompson, our very special guest from peak.
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:21.460]   Elk, Andy and I co Alex Lindsey in our show today brought to you by Zach Doc.
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:24.780]   You know, we don't have the national health service here in the United States.
[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:28.660]   We actually have to find our physicians on our own.
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:32.140]   Zach Doc though really solves this problem.
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:39.340]   And what I love most about Zach Doc is you, it's a free app, iPhone, Android.
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:45.780]   You can go on to the website and get, get, get the link by going to zach.com/macbreak.
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:48.820]   But you can actually narrow down the search by insurance.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:54.780]   So you can make sure you're going to a doctor that takes your insurance by, uh, whether
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:56.860]   they are available, you know, whether they have room.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.820]   So a lot of times these days in the US, you get a doctor and they say, well, I'm not taking
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:00.820]   on new patients.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:01.820]   Well, that's no good.
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:04.620]   Well, Zach Doc will find the doctor that is.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:10.820]   And it's not just doctors, it's physicians, dentists, chiropractors and every specialty.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:11.820]   I mentioned this before.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:17.820]   I was looking for a guarantologist for my older parent and, uh, I was able to narrow one
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:23.580]   down in the, in the area who takes her insurance, who's available.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:24.580]   This is fantastic.
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:27.860]   Oh, I left out the most important part.
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.940]   User reviews, verified reviews of the doctor.
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:33.940]   So you're going to find a doctor that fits your needs.
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:34.940]   This is important.
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.660]   Everybody has kind of different requirements for a doctor.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:40.300]   Some people want a doctor to explain it all in great detail.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:43.140]   Some people want a doctor to just say, just tell me doc, what should I do?
[02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:44.980]   Give me the one, the one answer.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:50.260]   You get to get the doctor that fits your style because you can read these reviews.
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:57.300]   Zach Doc is the only free app that lets you find and book doctors who are patient reviewed,
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:01:01.540]   take your insurance and are available when you need them and treat almost every condition
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:02.540]   under the sun.
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:05.420]   Book an appointment with a few taps in Zach Docs app.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:08.100]   You'll feel better faster with Zach Docs.
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:11.180]   Some of these docs available within 24 hours.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:14.620]   Forget Dr. Rulad or looking around on the internet.
[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:18.300]   You don't want to choose a doctor based on Yelp reviews.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:19.300]   Trust me.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:21.820]   Zach Docs the way to go.
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.020]   Zach Doc.com/Macbreak.
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:27.980]   Download the Zach Doc app for free.

[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:33.020]   Many available within 24 hours.
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:40.420]   ZOCDOC.com/MacBreak.
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:43.980]   Thank you so much for supporting MacBreak Weekly, Zach Doc.
[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.180]   I know a lot of you have used it.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.020]   I've used it now and it's really fantastic.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:53.340]   Zach Doc.com/MacBreak.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:56.580]   James, do you want to share a pick of the...
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:00.340]   You actually have a very interesting pick I see of the week.
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:01.340]   Yes.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.060]   This is something that I've been playing with.
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:10.780]   It's a little esoteric, but this is the Mr. FPGA.
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:17.500]   It's an open source hardware and software project to recreate classic consoles, computers and
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:23.820]   arcade systems via an FPGA processor, which is basically reprogrammable hardware that
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.580]   can become other chips.
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:32.180]   The idea is you download the design of a chip like a Motorola 68000 to the FPGA and then
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:34.740]   it effectively becomes that processor.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:39.140]   Jhin theory means that you get a more accurate recreation of the thing that you're trying
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.140]   to simulate.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:44.500]   It's slightly more complicated in practice and what is emulation versus simulation, but
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:46.500]   anyway, that's the basic idea.
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:51.820]   This thing can become a classic Mac, a Commodore 64, a Super Nintendo, pretty much anything
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:57.100]   from Pong to the PlayStation.
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:01.340]   You get this development board and then...
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:03.540]   Which looks a little bit like a Raspberry Pi.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:04.540]   Yes.
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:06.940]   It's exactly the size of a Raspberry Pi.
[02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:10.580]   Then you get these additional boards which stack on top.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:16.340]   That one in the picture there was showing it's got a VGA port on the top.
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.340]   Wow.
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:25.940]   You have inputs for putting classic controllers and analog stuff or whatever you want.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:28.540]   It's really fun.
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:30.540]   It can basically do...
[02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:40.420]   As I say, Pong to PlayStation, so you're talking at least 20 years worth of computers and things.
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.460]   Really nicely and they're...
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:47.380]   Because it's an open source project, lots of people working on it and there's new stuff
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:50.340]   coming out all the time.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:51.340]   Software emulating stuff.
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:53.780]   So it's not an FPGA on the board.
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:55.540]   It's actually an ARM processor.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.540]   It's an FPGA.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:05.580]   There's an FPGA and an ARM sidekick which can run some of the stuff but most of the actual
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:07.340]   work is done on the FPGA.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.580]   You're not reprogramming it or are you?
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:12.140]   Yes, you are.
[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:19.980]   You send it the thing saying here is the circuit diagram and what the chip looks like and it
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:21.620]   becomes that.
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:28.980]   It's like a transformer.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:34.900]   I think it's the same technology Apple used in the Afterburner card on the Mac Pro.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.100]   I think it used an FPGA on that.
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:41.980]   It's really just a way of creating hardware.
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:48.260]   I've been really interested in this since I started hearing about these a couple of
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:49.260]   years ago.
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:54.980]   How difficult is it to flash a different CPU and different electronics on it?
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:05:00.820]   Once you set it up as a Mac, is it enough trouble to flash it into a 386 set?
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:02.740]   You think twice before doing it?
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:04.540]   No, it's not difficult at all.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:07.500]   You push a button, you go up to a menu and you say, "No, you're this."
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.020]   Oh my God.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.420]   It's really simple and it's got it.
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:17.900]   I think the UI of it runs on the ARM processor and it's got Linux on it.
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:23.340]   But then you pick the core that you want and then you can like, pick disks or cartridges
[02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:24.180]   to it.
[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:28.180]   Is there a limit to the number of times you can reprogram it?
[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:29.260]   Does it wear out?
[02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:30.420]   I don't think so.
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:34.860]   I don't think it's so cool.
[02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:42.500]   It's really a nice little project because it's one of the first open source hardware
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:48.380]   things that I've seen of people just building these additional boards and then putting out
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:52.780]   the designs and then anyone can build the boards and sell them.
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:57.140]   I want to build a Lisp machine, a symbolic Lisp machine out of this.
[02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:00.700]   I wonder if I could, if anybody's got the...
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:01.700]   It's like ROMs, right?
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:07.620]   In effect, you're going to download the schematics and burn them into the FBA.
[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:09.660]   It's not emulating anything.
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:14.020]   It is creating a version of that chip in the EGA.
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:18.380]   I've wanted to play with one of these for a while.
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:22.900]   I would say that there is some stuff where it's like the chip that they make, it's not
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.180]   exactly the chip.
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.940]   It's a functionally equivalent chip.
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:31.180]   Sometimes there is an argument that, "Well, this is really just fancy emulation."
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:33.820]   But sometimes it's not.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:40.700]   It's the best thing I've seen for running old computers, yeah, comatoscacy for era stuff,
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:44.380]   and having it feel like the original.
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:53.020]   And the software you use is called MrFusion, so that's good.
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:54.020]   This is great.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:07:00.260]   Now, you gave us a link to the Mr. Devell Wiki.
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:05.500]   And then, of course, there's a GitHub repository of software.
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:08.020]   Where do you get the hardware?
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.660]   So, there's various ways you can do it.
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:15.700]   You can pay somebody and they will send you the entire thing.
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:16.700]   Or do it yourself.
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:22.260]   Or you can do it yourself, or you can do what I did, which was source this developer kit
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:27.660]   that has the FPGA on it, and then buy from a variety of sources the other boards and
[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:30.140]   put it together.
[02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:38.020]   It's, you know, you can buy the bare circuit boards or you can have the whole thing.
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:44.980]   And to buy a fully specced one, it's about $500, and it's cheaper than that if you don't
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:47.260]   need all the pieces.
[02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.700]   This is a lot of soldering if you do it this way.
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:53.260]   I don't recommend that approach.
[02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:56.780]   Wow, that's very cool.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:02.700]   So, PCB Way is the PCB manufacturer and you can get all the parts that go with it.
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:08.460]   But the thing to do is, and we'll put this link in the show notes, is to go to Mr. Devell
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:14.740]   on github.com/misder-dv-l.
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.300]   There's a wiki and there's a lot of information.
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:18.540]   There's a Discord.
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:22.540]   So, you know, if you want more details, it's all out there.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:23.780]   Very cool.
[02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:25.180]   Very cool.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:26.940]   I'm just fascinated by this.
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:27.940]   That's amazing.
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:28.940]   Yeah.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:36.580]   This is why, like, I have a lot of old Macs and as a display, because I enjoyed the object
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:37.580]   as a design.
[02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:42.580]   But things like this are why I'm not terribly interested in getting my SE30 or my 2CI,
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:47.180]   like actually booting up and running because, okay, let's get the power supply of Re-Capto.
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:49.940]   Okay, let's make sure there's no corrosion on these things.
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:52.660]   Okay, how are we going to get a keyboard hooked up to it?
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:54.860]   It's more interesting to see.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.580]   It's less nostalgia and more.
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:01.260]   Isn't it interesting to create something brand new that will be able to play the old
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.660]   hits the way we like it?
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:07.620]   The problem is it leads you into thinking things like, what if I could get one of those
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:14.980]   really nice broadcast CRT displays, you know, that they used and, like, I could hook it up
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:19.580]   to that and then I could see what, you know, the Super Nintendo games look, actually looked
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:21.140]   like, like the movie.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.140]   Wow.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:25.820]   What is Mr. currently operating as?
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:32.700]   I would say, like, my comfort platform is, like, going back to Super Nintendo because
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:35.260]   that was really...
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:42.220]   So I foolishly decided, like, a month before my final exams of university, what would
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:45.700]   really be good was if I bought a Super Nintendo.
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:47.660]   Oh boy.
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:49.460]   Oh boy.
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:52.460]   How would that work for you?
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:53.460]   Yeah.
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:54.460]   Wow.
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:56.900]   Hey, look, I passed perfectly well.
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:57.900]   It was okay.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:01.180]   But I don't recommend this as a strategy.
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:03.300]   I was playing Zelda back then as well.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:05.420]   So, you know, it's like what comes around.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:06.420]   Isn't that funny?
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:07.420]   You're still playing Zelda.
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:08.420]   All these years later.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:09.420]   Yep.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:10.420]   Slightly more common.
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:11.420]   So this is interesting.
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:14.260]   This is hardware that...
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:15.420]   It's not a software emulator.
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:23.060]   This is hardware that actually duplicates the circuitry of a variety of older machines.
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:24.060]   Very interesting.
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:25.060]   Mr.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:29.620]   M-I-S-T-E-R and on GitHub, Mr. Dash Develle will get you started.
[02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:34.860]   There's wiki and all sorts of stuff that you can learn about the Mr.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.860]   Wow.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:39.500]   Andy and I'll go pick of the week.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:46.500]   Mine is a simple one.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:49.500]   Brad Root has written a really cool screensaver that I just...
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:52.500]   He tweeted it at me and I said, "Okay, screensaver, I like screensavers."
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:55.500]   And I thought, "I wouldn't like it that much."
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:56.500]   I thought, "Okay, whatever."
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.500]   But, oh my God, I'm enjoying it a lot.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:00.500]   It's called Aline.
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:01.500]   It is...
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:06.500]   All it is, it's a screensaver written in Swift that all it is is essentially JSON that will download
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:10.740]   images from a list of URLs that are continually updated on the screensaver.
[02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:16.900]   However, what it's drawing from is a collection of constantly updated Baha'u's style abstract
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:18.860]   art generated by stable diffusion.
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:19.860]   Oh, wow.
[02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:23.500]   And again, that's why I read that in the GitHub description.
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:26.020]   It's like, "Okay, well, I'm making that could be okay."
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:29.580]   But as soon as I put it in, I forgot, like, "My God, this artwork that I...
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:34.940]   I don't know what parameters they're giving it, but it is generating legit, beautiful
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:37.260]   pieces of art that don't look like...
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:39.420]   They don't look like stable diffusion, anything.
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:41.660]   They don't look like AI, something.
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:46.460]   They're just very, very pretty, almost distractingly pretty on a big screen.
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:48.220]   And it's free.
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.700]   And as I think that there isn't enough development of cool screensavers because when your screen
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.820]   isn't doing something, it could at least make your office your house pretty.
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:57.300]   And this definitely does that.
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:04.580]   I will say that I wrote a whole screensaver with 18 modules last year for the Relay podcast
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:05.580]  athon.
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:07.060]   Oh, yes.
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:08.060]   And that will prompt...
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:09.060]   Who knows?
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:11.500]   I might update that for the next one this year.
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:16.540]   But that was actually a ton of fun to actually go back and try and do an after-dark style.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:19.460]   Did you have a flying toaster in your screensaver?
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:20.460]   I had...
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:21.460]   Did I do that?
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:26.940]   So in the about screen for Dice by Peacock, there is a screensaver which is very much
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:27.940]   flying toasters.
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:28.940]   Does it?
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:29.940]   It's flying dice.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:36.060]   Yes, I did sort of fireworks and all the kind of traditional things.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:37.420]   How fun is that?
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:38.860]   Where can we get that?
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:46.340]   Well, you needed to have backed their podcastathon to raise money for the St. Jude Kids Cancer
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.340]   charity.
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.460]   So it was an exclusive for that.
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.380]   And what a generous thing for you to do.
[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.380]   That's really cool.
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:55.980]   Well, it was a fun thing and it is for a really good cause.
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:56.980]   So...
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:12:58.620]   I'm impressed.
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:01.180]   You could write a screensaver and how many modules?
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:02.940]   10 modules in a few days.
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:06.100]   It was 18 modules because I got carried away.
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:07.900]   Wow, that's great.
[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:09.860]   Which is not something I ever do.
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:12.260]   You could find the...
[02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:13.260]   Is it Elaine?
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:14.260]   How do we pronounce that?
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:15.260]   I don't know.
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:16.260]   E-A-L-A-I-N.
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:19.220]   It is spelled E-A-L-A-I-N.
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:22.460]   Brad is kind enough on his own personal blog to explain.
[02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:25.020]   It's like Ali with a very soft N at the end of it.
[02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:26.020]   It's Gaelic.
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:29.900]   Ah, well then James should be able to pronounce that too.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:31.540]   Yeah, I live in Glasgow.
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:35.740]   It looks very Scottish, doesn't it?
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:41.460]   And there is a GitHub as well for this where you can see how it works and download it for
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.380]   version 0.1 from Echo S.
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:48.500]   I guess the only caution I'd say is that the images come from a node script he's running
[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:51.980]   at his house that then uploads the images to S3.
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:55.220]   So this, you know, it's free, which is good.
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:13:59.300]   Who knows how long he's going to want to continue to do that.
[02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:03.500]   But he's not doing the stable diffusion from his own machine.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.580]   It's from a work group.
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:09.940]   And so I haven't seen any repetition really at all from this.
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:11.620]   So he keeps it fresh.
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:15.300]   And I don't think that it's going to be up forever, but foul it's up.
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:17.340]   For now, it's fun.
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.340]   Yeah.
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:23.140]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, I think it's up to you to blow my budget.
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.140]   Not at all.
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:25.140]   Not at all.
[02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:27.780]   I think it's been a pretty affordable one.
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.180]   Pretty affordable.
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:34.220]   I am recommending there's this little program that people can get called Apple's keynote.
[02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:35.220]   Oh, it's free.
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.420]   I just got updated last week.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:42.740]   And it has an important feature in it that some people, it's worth talking about just
[02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:46.540]   because it now imports SVGs.
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:51.700]   I know that that doesn't sound like a big deal to a lot of people.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:58.180]   But for many of us getting objects in and having them become shapes and then being able
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:03.900]   to make those shapes into our own custom libraries and be able to break them up so you
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:05.060]   can break up the shapes.
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:06.500]   You can turn them into custom libraries.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:13.020]   There used to be an AI to keynote filter that used to work that stopped working.
[02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:18.900]   And if you're building a lot of, if you build as many presentations as I do, not having
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:22.340]   your, you know, being able to have custom, a lot of custom shapes in there that, and it's
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.860]   again, it's not an object.
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:30.180]   So when it becomes a shape inside of, inside of keynote, it means that you can fill it
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:31.980]   with different colors.
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:33.740]   You can treat it like a shape.
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:36.140]   It's a different class of object.
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:41.300]   And that hasn't been something that has been something that we've been asking for almost
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:42.300]   since version one.
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:45.940]   So it's just been like, and why can't we just import this?
[02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:50.780]   And so the last update has made the SVGs available.
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:59.300]   And so it is a, for those folks that use keynote a lot, they'll be quickly checking for their
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:00.300]   updates.
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:05.020]   I don't have everything automatically updating and literally people were sending me Discord's
[02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:08.380]   going, keynote now has SVGs.
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:13.820]   So this is a very geeky keynote user, heavy keynote user feature that has been added.
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:14.820]   There's a couple of other things.
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:17.820]   They are, but the SVG thing is worth it.
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:21.940]   And I still think that keynote is probably one of the most powerful communication apps
[02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:22.940]   ever built.
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:27.540]   So it's, if you're not using keynote to its fullest, I would highly recommend looking
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:32.180]   at the feature set because it's much more robust than everything else.
[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:35.980]   I think it's one of the best apps that Apple is making at the moment.
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:37.300]   Oh my gosh.
[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:41.460]   It's just, it is, I'm putting together, I have this really complex presentation I'm building
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:42.460]   right now.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:47.460]   And I realized working on it, someone was talking about it and I was talking about how I started
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:50.700]   really going off on keynote about how great it is and everything else.
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:54.340]   And I said, I've made more money with this app than any other app that I've had on my
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:55.340]   phone.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:58.860]   Like, is it because it's the one that you, you, you sell ideas with, you know, and you,
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:02.620]   and you sold more projects with it than anything else.
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:03.620]   And I use it up.
[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.980]   I mean, I use up all the little animations.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:11.380]   I'm a, I dig deep into, you know, my, you know, all of my, my, my object order and how
[02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:14.060]   they all come on and, and, and I don't have anything.
[02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:18.340]   I never have a slide that just pops up and like, this is the, all the information.
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:20.100]   It's like, I'm going to bring this out, this out.
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:24.420]   These pop these out, move these in and there's so many great little animations in there that
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:25.940]   help you tell the story.
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:31.220]   If you're an educator or someone obviously doing business, I mean, it's just, and I've
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:36.580]   built whole videos with just, you know, just, just build the entire video out and send it
[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:37.580]   to someone.
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:38.940]   We know with my voice over.
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:43.780]   And it's just done and those ideas, you know, then pass around really nicely and cleanly.
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:47.300]   So I'd highly recommend if you haven't played with it and we haven't taken advantage of
[02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:48.300]   it, it's free.
[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:50.300]   It comes with your Mac.
[02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:51.300]   Download it.
[02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:56.180]   So it's, and it's just, and it works on your, I mean, it works on the iPad version, by the
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.940]   way, has all these features that the desktop version doesn't have.
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:03.300]   I was sitting in, Apple has these educator, um, free educator seminars, which are really
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:04.820]   great, by the way.
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:08.220]   And they have, they were showing stuff like you can just grab with your pencil.
[02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:12.260]   You can just grab an object and just animate it by just moving it around with your pencil,
[02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:16.260]   just just build a motion path like this and then, and then hit animate and just animate
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:17.260]   it out.
[02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:20.500]   And there's little things like that that, um, even for me, we're new because I don't,
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:24.220]   I don't use the iPad to design my, I use them.
[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:30.180]   I use it to flesh out my or knock out my ideas, but I don't usually use it to refine them.
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:31.700]   And there's a lot of tools in there as well.
[02:18:31.700 --> 02:18:36.700]   So, um, and you know, you can control it with your watch, but you can go frame by frame with
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:37.700]   your, with your watch.
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:43.140]   And so it's, it's a, it's an incredible application that I'd highly recommend if you haven't played
[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:48.340]   with it a lot and I'm just using the excuse, the fact that they finally added this probably
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:54.420]   the only feature we want, we've wanted more than SVG or equal to SVG is USDZ.
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:57.660]   And so we're, we're all crossing our fingers.
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:00.980]   So I will now explain what Alex just said.
[02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:04.500]   SVG stands scalable vector graphics.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:10.260]   These are the images you'd create with like Adobe illustrator instead of a bitmap.
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:13.180]   They're actually descriptions of triangles, lines and circles.
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:17.220]   And so they scale infinitely infinitely small, infinitely big.
[02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:21.500]   And I get, I didn't know that you couldn't import an SVG shape.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:24.820]   You can bring, you can bring, you can bring line art in the past, but it wasn't, it was
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:26.100]   treated as an image.
[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:28.340]   It becomes a bit map all of a sudden.
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.540]   And so, and still scalable.
[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:34.420]   But the main thing is that it, you couldn't turn it into an odd, a true object inside
[02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:35.420]   of it.
[02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:39.580]   And what that means by turning into a true shape means that as you, cause a lot of times
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:42.620]   what you're doing in, in keynote or at least what I do is I decide this is going to be
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:46.700]   black and white presentation or this is going to be a colored presentation.
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:51.420]   And I can very quickly change all those colors of all my shapes to match whatever the look
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:57.180]   and feel that I'm building into looks like if you have an image, you can't do that.
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:19:59.260]   Like so you can, you can do little bits and pieces.
[02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:00.260]   You don't have those handles.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.180]   So treating it like a shape, being able to break it up.
[02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:07.500]   So for instance, there's shapes, you can take a shape in keynote and select it and then
[02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:11.460]   go in and say, I want to, you know, and again, yeah, you can combine shapes.
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:12.460]   You know, so,
[02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:15.700]   So you haven't lost your, the, the, the outline.
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:16.700]   Yeah.
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:17.700]   Like, for instance,
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:21.420]   You've got a good example is when you do the, when you do the earth shape, there's
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.100]   not like an unroll, an unmapped, a mocator projection of the earth in.
[02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:26.940]   Oh, and you get all the countries.
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:27.940]   Oh,
[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:30.820]   it's kind of nice except for no one needs Antarctica.
[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:34.380]   So like, so you're always like, so you're always, so what I have is I have a, I have
[02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:36.300]   a shape of, I know one cares about it.
[02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:38.300]   I'm really relieved to climb it.
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.300]   I'm in salt.
[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:40.300]   I'm in salt.
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:41.660]   But, but no one cares.
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:43.740]   And so I, I, I did like to.
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:44.740]   Okay.
[02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:49.220]   I, I break it up into points and then I delete Antarctica and then I save it as a shape.
[02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:51.380]   So when I add mine, I'm like, I don't need that.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:52.300]   I don't need that part.
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:55.640]   And so those are the kind of things you can do with an SVG that you can't do necessarily
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.860]   with any of the other image files that you have there.
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:20:58.860]   You have to just crop them.
[02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:04.820]   And so it also makes sure if you start using a lot of logos, I like my logos to print well,
[02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:09.020]   and which means that I'm bringing in giant pings of all my logos or so on and so forth.
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.980]   Or an SVG now and yeah, no, yes.
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:16.560]   And it just imports as part of the, you know, chew, the choose command under insert.
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:19.480]   You can just import it and take it in and any image.
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:20.480]   It was just fine.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.480]   And that's fine.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:22.720]   So it's, thank you, Apple.
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:23.720]   It's really useful.
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:26.800]   The best, easy one I was talking about is of course the 3D format that we hope it's
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:31.600]   everywhere in the Mac except it appears that it's everywhere in the Mac except for the office
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:32.600]   apps.
[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:36.840]   We feel like there's a certain level of pressure there that they're probably just trying to
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.080]   figure out how to integrate it.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:39.080]   Yeah.
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:41.120]   Alex Lindsey, thank you so much.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.400]   Office hours.global is the place to watch.
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.560]   Alex, pretty much any time of the day or night.
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:51.760]   It's broadcasting early in the morning and then they take the, what is the second hour
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:54.120]   make it a YouTube video so you can watch those later.
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:59.440]   Best thing to do, go to office hours.global and check it out.
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:03.880]   And you can see all the stuff and you can even, if you want, join the Zoom call so you could
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:08.080]   be there live as part of the, we were talking about HTML graphics this morning, which was
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:09.080]   great.
[02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:12.000]   SPX is what we use for our show.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.040]   And so how those work with janitor of art yesterday, of course, we're talking about making
[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:20.520]   a variety of, there's a couple of things that, there's a couple tips there that are pretty,
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:31.360]   very useful and we've embarked on doing, we've got a, we're doing accessibility on Saturdays
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:32.360]   for the whole summer.
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:36.440]   It's usually education and we had an incredible event.
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:41.120]   We had an incredible one on Saturday where we were actually had, we had deaf panelists
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:46.640]   and ASL interpreters and all of the, and they were seamlessly talking back.
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:50.960]   It was, you know, us figuring out how to make that all work so that they could, they were
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:54.680]   just part of that conversation and it worked much better than I was a little concerned
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:59.120]   about it, but you can see, here you see someone talking, but there's other places where there
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:02.600]   were actually, if you go to other, and so it was a lot of us figuring out, but if you
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:06.200]   look at like when someone's signing in the main window, you'll see someone signing there.
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:07.200]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:12.160]   And that's someone talking and now our, you know, so then, then what has the ASL interpreter
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:16.720]   has to swap, you know, switch shift gears and, and translate to us.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:17.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:23.520]   So the speaker is speaking in ASL and then you have an interpreter speaking it on his
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:24.520]   headset.
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:25.840]   Wow, that's really cool.
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:27.800]   I'm really glad you're doing this on Saturday.
[02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:29.720]   That's very, very exciting.
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:36.320]   But all of this information is at office hours dot global and it's really a great gift to
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:37.760]   the internet that you're doing.
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:38.760]   A lot of fun.
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:45.760]   So I'm going to be on the Boston Public Library at quarter to one Eastern time on Friday.
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:48.120]   So show up by yourself a copy.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:49.680]   Enjoy the entire show.
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:51.640]   Usually they have musical guests on Friday too.
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:53.000]   So it's a pretty good time.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:58.800]   And if you can't be at the Boston Public Library at Friday, listen at wgphnews.org live or later.
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:01.760]   That's probably also going to be on the YouTube channel.
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:03.760]   So I'm going to be on the website.
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:10.760]   That's probably also going to be on the YouTube channel for WGBH news, which is also oddly
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:12.360]   enough to be GPH news.
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:13.360]   Anything else you're doing?
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:16.120]   Any other parents as you want to share?
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:18.880]   I might have something to talk about in three and a half weeks.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:19.980]   Excellent.
[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:21.960]   I will, I will set my timer.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.760]   If this were read it, I would have a bot tell me, remind me.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:26.760]   So set your timer.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:29.040]   But as usual with me, don't hold your breath.
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:32.000]   That's kind of the story of my life.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000]   Set your timer.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000]   I love your breath.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000]   I like it.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:41.320]   Mr. James Thompson, we are so grateful to have a couple of hours with you and your thoughts.
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:43.800]   We really appreciate everything you do.
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.400]   Peacock is an amazing thing.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:48.360]   Dice is an amazing thing.
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:50.760]   So it's a pleasure to be here.
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:55.880]   I mean, I'm quite happy to come back the next time one of Jason's children graduates.
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:57.160]   Every four years.
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.880]   No, we will have you back soon.
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:05.760]   I like having a developer on because you get your hands in the gears in the works and we
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:07.680]   like to know what it's like in there.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:08.680]   Thank you, James.
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:10.480]   Sometimes your hand gets caught.
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:13.360]   That's really what happens.
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:14.360]   Don't wear a long scarf.
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:15.360]   That's all.
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:17.080]   peacalk.com.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:23.240]   If you want to get peacalk on the iPhone, on the iPad, on the Mac, it's much more than
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:25.080]   a calculator, kids.
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:29.840]   But if you are looking at your iPad saying, why, why, why is there no calculator?
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:32.360]   There is the only calculator.
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:33.360]   Peacalk.
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:35.040]   And you can have a free one.
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:36.720]   So yeah, just pick up light.
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:37.720]   Peacalk, money.
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:39.440]   Peacalk, light, man.
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:41.840]   There's no reason not to.
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:46.760]   So James messages, never trust a long time Apple developer who still has all his fingers.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:48.720]   That means he has a lot of experience.
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:55.120]   I mean, it was sometimes the damage is internal, but it's always there.
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:01.040]   And I will note that the cap being worn by this is fine guy, the dog in your lower right
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:04.360]   of your screen is available on the peacalk store.
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:09.920]   If you want to a cap with the number 42 on it, that you and the insiders will know what
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:11.640]   that means.
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:12.720]   That is a great cap.
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:15.040]   There's also T-shirts and more.
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:19.040]   And even a peacalk, peacalk pen.
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.440]   So you honor Pascal with your.
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:29.800]   Yes, that is our panda mascot who is indeed named after the language and the mathematician.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:32.640]   But it's also Pascal and Peacalk.
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:34.080]   It's kind of very similar.
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:35.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:37.200]   It's almost an anagram, almost.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.680]   If you have more than one peacalk, it's an anagram.
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:42.680]   Thank you, James.
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:44.240]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:45.240]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:47.080]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:51.360]   We do a Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:59.160]   If you want to watch us live, you can 1,800 UTC, which means it's dinner time for James.
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:01.200]   All you have to do is go to live.twit.tv.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.280]   There's a live stream audio or video there.
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.480]   You can chat with us live at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:14.320]   Of course, club Twit members get a special kind of we consider it like the club level.
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:17.560]   You have to do on Discord so you can chat there with us.
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.000]   Seven bucks a month also gets you ad free versions of all of our shows.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.160]   Special shows we don't put out in public like Michael Sargent's Hands on Mac, Hands
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.960]   on Windows with Paul Therat, Scott Wilkinson's home theater geeks.
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:37.240]   It really is a very important part of our our monetization these days as advertising
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:39.800]   for podcasts starts to dwindle.
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:42.640]   You pick up the slack and we thank you for doing that.
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:44.200]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:47.920]   Thank you club members for making this possible.
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.080]   After the fact, club member or not add free versions of the show for the club, add supported
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.240]   versions available on our website at twit.tv/mbw.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.600]   There's also a dedicated YouTube channel to Mac break weekly that has even more ads and
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:05.680]   some of which we didn't put in there.
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.040]   And of course, the best way to get this show is to subscribe.
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.440]   If you go to twit.tv/mbw, you see links to some of the big podcast applications, but
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:17.560]   also the RSS because we are an RSS feed and always will be.
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.720]   You can subscribe right there and get the show the minute it's available of a Tuesday
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:23.720]   evening.
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:25.880]   Thanks for everybody for joining us.
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.840]   Now I got to say sorry to say it.
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:34.240]   Time to get back to work because break time is over and I'm going to Disney Land.
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:37.560]   Oh, hey, that's a really nice iPhone you have there.
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:38.800]   You totally picked the right color.
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:44.720]   Hey, since you do use an iPhone and maybe use an iPad or an Apple Watch or an Apple TV,
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:47.360]   well, you should check out iOS today.
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:52.760]   That's a show that I, Mike Asargent and my co-host Rosemary Orchard host every Tuesday
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:54.520]   right here on the Twit network.
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:29:00.720]   It covers all things iOS, TVOS, Homebot OS, Watch OS, iPad OS, it's all the OS that Apple
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:01.720]   has on offer.
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:05.240]   And we love to give you tips and tricks about making the most of those devices, checking
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:10.200]   out great apps and services and answering your tech questions.
