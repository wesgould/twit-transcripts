Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is now unembargoed. I am. I'm unencumbered by Apple embargoes. I can tell all about  headset. Nope, Final Cut and Logic for the iPad. Sorry folks. Be very, very careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All also with us. We'll tell you about what that's all about in a second. Also with us,  Andy Anakos, WGBH of Boston. Almost said the other thing. Hello, Andrew. Hello. You always

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tell when Jason is under embargo, his hair is like lighter, more bounce, more body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was the head and shoulders. What did I know? And Mr. Alex Lindsay from officehours.global.  Hello, Alex. Apple's worldwide developer conference kicking off less than a week away.  No, more than a week away. A week from Monday. Scared me. I scared you. A week from, it's official  though. They've put out a press release. So a week from Monday and we'll be here recording  our coverage. We did that this morning at 9 a.m. I got up to watch such an Adele say  Microsoft's all about AI. Kind of knew that. That was all about the cloud. I'm not doing it.  It's the cloud and AI. It's together at last. Two great takes. It's about the cloud as a service.  I think. Yeah. And tomorrow we'll cover it as well from 9 a.m. And then, oh good, I'm glad it's not  this Monday. A week from Monday, June 5th, 10 a.m. Pacific. We will cover the WWDC Q&A, which for  which I'm getting more and more excited, especially since Costco is selling Mac minis for 300 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's cheaper than a brisket. They're clearing them out. That is, because the Raspberry Pi is so  short stocked because of component shortages, that might be actually less than you might pay  for like a top of the line Raspberry Pi. Wouldn't that be wild? If you absolutely needed one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be wild? With markups. I'm just going to stick that behind a, you know, screen and make

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a picture cube thing. You can put Velcro on it and just attach it to the. Yeah. Yeah. I asked John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said, do we need more Mac minis? He said, well, we have lots of Mac minis, but they're the old  Intel ones, but they work fine. So, you know, they're doing little things. Such a difference.  I know. Such a difference. But they're not doing anything. They're running, you know,  software somewhere. We'll get them when we need them. Anyway, they're all sold out anyway,  but they're still brisket if anybody wants to pick some up and giant bags of Doritos.  Another Tuesday morning, another Apple announcement. They have announced a  multi-billion dollar deal with Broadcom. You may remember Apple made a commitment  to the US government in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the US economy because all of their  money comes from China. So they're going to put it back into the US economy. So they've made a  big deal with Broadcom to build 5G radio frequency components in the US. When they say 5G, they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talking about phones, right? Yeah. It couldn't be anything else. The only question is that,  does that mean that they're involving themselves in US manufacturing? So does that mean that they're  going to be using Broadcom as their chip manufacturer for their own design of modem  chips? Or does that mean that they're committing to sticking with Qualcomm for their modem chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for the next two or three years? Unclear, right? The 5G radio, this is from CNBC, the 5G radio  components developed by Broadcom will include F-bar filters and other wireless connectivity  components according to the release. These components are different from the 5G modems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  made by Qualcomm. It doesn't tell us either way. I've seen some people react to the story  as saying, wow, does this mean Apple's not making their own modems? Unless we hear otherwise,  no, it doesn't mean that. They are still doing that, but they have a deal with Broadcom.  This is best read, I think, as a we generate jobs in America press release. It's a political  and not as anything beyond that because it's great. They may use Broadcom to build the chips.  Somebody's going to have to build their chips. Apple doesn't build its own chips.  When it does make that move away from Qualcomm, if it ever does, maybe Broadcom helps with that.  I don't know. I think you could read too much into this announcement because Apple loves to do these  PR blitzes where they're like, look at how many jobs we create. This is one of those PR things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be a Foxconn thing to remember how they made big noise about, hey, look,  we're building actual manufacturing plants in the United States and in the Midwest. We're creating  jobs. Then five years later, hey, they're basically creating jobs of security guards to mind the empty

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  lot where nothing's being built. Yeah. We're actually in an old Broadcom office right now,  right here. They moved out and they moved next door and then they've moved out next door.  So they moved down the road a piece. But Broadcom was originally part of HP,  the semiconductor product division of Hewlett Packard. Then they spun it off to Agilent,  which made Petaluma the telecom valley briefly. We had a lot of telecom going on here.  Anyway, that's, I guess, they said they'd do it, so they've done it. Now you have it. Now you have it.  Do we have them? Did we learn anything? We didn't learn anything. I should have looked at this  worldwide developers conference press release. They didn't tell us anything we didn't already know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? Nope. Nope. It really was. I mean, what happened today is essentially that the press  got invited. We already knew there were developers who were invited. The press got invited today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did not get an invite here at MacBreak Weekly, but Jason, I imagine you did.  Yeah, I'll be there. Micah went last year, did not get invited this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We rode a cart together. You rode a cart? Yeah, golf cart. That wasn't that event. That was a  different event, but we did go and yeah, they were like, oh, we'll just drive you over to do this  podcast on a golf cart. And like, well, how do you say no when Apple offers to just shepherd  you around their campus? I think that's fun. Yeah. Yeah. And then you wave at everybody as  you go by. Did it have leather seats? Was it like a special golf cart? No, it was not like  an Apple golf cart. It was just a golf cart. They didn't let you use the bikes? Yeah. No,  no, no. I mean, again, a golf cart driven by an Apple employee taking us where we were  allowed to go. It's supposed to be clear. We don't want to be handing you bikes. You might  have to go into the real estate. It's like free range. You could just go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the gaming term? It was on rails, not open. Yeah, exactly. Because if you get on a bike,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they got to like take a metal pole and stick it in the spokes and knock you over and get you out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of there. I think they have those little auto locking bikes. Nope. You can't go there. Not in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that zone. It doesn't go to that zone. Although there were a couple of people who were posting,  developers who got invites to posting about how the broad welcome party schedule  includes, of course, the keynote, of course, a lunch, the platform, say the union, all that stuff  is traditional every single year, but followed by a special tour of Apple Park and then a  special evening activity that you won't want to miss. And a smaller event at the Apple Developer  Center on Tuesday to discuss some of the latest announcements. But you know what? I'm not going

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to check my Gmail. I'm not. I know I didn't get invited. I'm not going to give you the satisfaction,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple. But that sounds like fun. All attendees will be tested for Pink Eye before the Tuesday event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You will be going to that, Jason, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a developer event. So what they do is unclear. Well, it's unclear, right? Maybe,  maybe not. What is it? It's a mystery. Like they don't specify. I mean, maybe it's been a while,  Leo, but like they're not really forthcoming about. I've been told to appear in Cappuccino  on a Monday morning and then what happens after that is between-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it keeps you on your toes. It's the wonder of the mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a little Pandora locket golf cart trinket attached to your maybe a little hint? No.  This is the invite, which I'll have to defer to Matthew Panzerino at TechCrunch for his copy.  You're invited RSVP to join us in person and watch the keynote address kicking off at WWDC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at Apple Park, June 5th, 10 a.m. Have fun. It's the same art that they use for all of the  WWDC stuff this year. Oh, is it? Nothing new to be gleaned. Yeah. It's the Apple Park ring  and its colors and some people have said that it also suggests that it's the lenses.  The different refractors of the lenses. Oh, the periscope lenses on the iPhone 15.  No, of the lenses in the headset. Oh, the headset. What's that?  It's a product that you're convinced is not going to happen. It's going to totally happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not going to happen. Actually, it's not me. It's Glenn Fleischman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glenn Fleischman was surprised that they're going to release a headset. I wonder where he's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, anyway, so I think that'll be fun. I haven't checked my junk mail folder yet,  so maybe it just got kicked into junk mail. I'll wait till that, but I should focus on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'll pick that up afterward. Yeah. We have been introduced to the 2023 finalists  for the Apple Design Awards, which will be announced also on that Monday, I think, right?  Do you want to know? In the inclusivity category, Anne, Universe, Passenger Assistance,  Finding Hannah, Ancient Board Game Collection, and Stitch. Those seem like delightful and fun apps,  but there is a separate category for those. Duo Lingo, Cream, Chantlings, Pocket Card, Jockey,  Ride On, Not Words, which you recommended, Jason, and I'm still using. Love it. And Afterplace,  Interaction, Shuffles by Pinterest. Can you win twice? So these have to be new, right?  Or no? I don't know. I don't recognize a lot of these titles. Tile Guide,  Charts and Tables, Flighty, which I do use. It's a subscription program. I think that was a pick  at one point. That's a great tool. Yeah. Automatoys, Railbound, and Kimono Cats,  one of my favorites. For Social Impact, Duo Lingo again, Sago, Mini, First Words, Headspace,  Meditation App, Hindsight, Endling, Extinction is Forever, and Be carbonized. Visuals and Graphics,  Any Distance, Gentler, Streak Health, Fitness, Riveo, Diablo Immortal, the game that costs you  forever. Resident Evil Village, Endling again, Innovation, Camo, Yay, Camo Studio, Swing Vision,  Rise, Energy and Sleep Tracker, I'm familiar with that. Resident Evil Village, played that briefly.  Oh, um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stitch. Yeah, that's nominated twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And Marvel Snap. Let's look at Stitch. Marvel Snap, yeah. Stitch it to puzzle out. So  Stitch you have to sew according to the numbers digitally, and then it's a Shikaku puzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Those are always fun because they're certainly not the most popular. They're maybe  not even apps that have gotten a lot of traction. They really are the ones that they're trying to  reward developers who are most creative and or support most of what Apple has been promoting as  here is what a proper and creative and innovative Mac app or iPhone app should look like. So it's  not like the Cable Ace Awards or the Grammy Awards. They're paragons of Apple virtue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. Fealty. They bend the knee very, very well.  Bend the knee. Anyway, there's the Design Award finals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're great stuff. Yeah. They're always, there are always a lot of apps that I've never  heard of. And then when I try them out, they're like, oh my God, how come I never heard this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so cool. Well, this is for a good example. Ann, the first one I mentioned, Morse Assistant  for DeafBlind people. So you can communicate through vibrations. That's interesting. Oh,  Ann is Helen Keller's assistant. That's right. She drew on her on her hand, right?  A date, a gate, DeafBlind gateway to the outside world powered by Morse code and iPhone haptics.  What an interesting idea. Yeah. Yeah. And it looks very pretty too.  Yeah. Nicely done. That's very cool. So that's just a little sampler of what you can expect.  Oh, Apple is now appealing. Let's see. They've, it's complicated. The EU tax, remember Apple won.  So it's Ireland that's appealing or the EU is appealing. Apple won in this overseas tax in  Ireland. The back taxes of 30 billion Irish dollars, pounds, euros. That's what it is.  13 billion euros. Apple won in 2020 after insisting in 2020 it would appeal. The  European Commission has finally petitioned three years later, the Court of Justice of the European  Union to get that 13 bill. The contention was that Ireland extended preferential treatment to Apple  that was illegal in the EU. And so Apple should have paid that tax. And the courts did not say  that. They said, no, Apple doesn't know that tax, which is, does seem kind of unfair to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Ireland said we didn't want it. Yeah. We already forgave them. Yeah. We never asked for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. In 2020, July, 2020, the EU's second highest court ruled in favor of Apple and Ireland,  saying that it was not an unlawful tax preference, but they're going to appeal it.  Apple said we paid our taxes, paid every penny that we were legally required to. We paid every  penny. All right. I think it's time for hands on. Let's get hands on Jason Snell, hands on the  hard body. I like to call it. Easy now. You have for a week, very stealthily been using Final Cut  Pro for the iPad and Logic for the iPad. It's true. It's true. Yeah. Barger just dropped. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what can I say? Logic. So, okay. A lot of podcasters out there who are Mac users have been using Logic  to edit their podcasts. I use Logic to edit my podcasts on the Mac. And they were very curious  about would this mean they could edit those podcasts on the iPad or round trip them between  the Mac and the iPad. And I'm here to tell you two things about that. One is you could always edit  podcasts on the iPad. The app's called Fair Right Recording Studio. It's excellent. It's made for  podcasters and you should use it. And two, Logic on the Mac is like, and I said this, I think last  week, it's like an app that we can use, but it's like, we're using it wrong. It's not for us. It's  not made for us. It's a music app. It's a music app. It's a professional music app. It's not for  editing speech, particularly. Exactly. Right. I mean, it's not, you have to, you can set it up  to do it, but it's like, it really wants to have musical bars and a tempo and you can kind of hide  that stuff. When Apple built Logic for the iPad, what did they do? Well, they emphasize what it's  for, which is music. It's got even fewer of the features that podcasters might use. And while you  can edit spoken word things in Logic for the iPad, don't. Don't. Don't try. It's really unpleasant.  You can do it, but it's like, there are so many better options.  Fair right is a much better option. And like even I tried to bring in a project that I brought  that I podcast project project that I built on the Mac to the iPad and it said, sorry, although  this is a logic project, it is not saved using the music grid. So although they talk about round  trip, it actually is for very specific kinds of projects, which are music projects. Otherwise  it won't even open a logic project from the Mac. So there's a lot, right? So anyway, final cut,  I think is way more interesting, even though when the announcements came out, we were all like, oh,  final cut is a dozen round trip and it's limited feature set. It doesn't have all the features of  the Mac. It's going to be disappointing and logic is going to be exciting. Logic has more limitations  compared to the Mac version than you might think if you're a podcaster anyway. Final cut is really  good. It needs to be better. There's some things they could do to make it better. If you're using  it just with touch, there are things they could do to make it better. If you're using Apple pencil,  but I was able to, once I got the hang of it and they've done some very clever things to move some  stuff around in the interface, I could add it pretty quickly. I think that it's got a huge  amount of potential, even if, you know, there's stuff that, um, apps like fair, right learned a  while ago that, that, uh, that it needs to learn like little multi-touch gestures and things to  make it a little faster. Here's a bug you found. You dragged a video track and it flipped it upside  down. It turned out, well, that was right before it crashed. First it flips it upside down and  that's, that's like the sign of the devil. And then if you continue to use it, then it just crashes  entirely. And I found that a lot. I had trouble dragging things around sometimes. Other times  it worked fine. Um, I did capture the moment where it inverted the wave form right before it  crashed. Very nicely done. Yeah. You just, yeah, I mean, it's a 1.0, but like, I feel like they could  add, add some niceties and it would be something. And in terms of the power of the iPad, I mean,  we're talking about M1 and M2 devices. They are on the Mac. They're just fine. And guess what?  They're just fine on the iPad too, in terms of editing and exporting, encoding video, all of  those things. It just works. So, um, strangely though, yeah, it's optimized for touch. Doesn't  have a lot of multi-touch niceties and the keyboard shortcuts are actually pretty good. Um,  and can help speed things along because, you know, if you want to split a clip or you want to delete  a clip really fast, or you want to toggle play or pause on the iPad with touch, you've got to like,  do a tap or two in a particular place. Um, and if you've got a keyboard, it's just what you're used  to, which is press the space bar or command B to blade the clip or delete key to delete the clip.  It's very familiar when you're using that. So like, I feel like they're, they're really close  and that this is only going to get better. And if I, honestly, if I were to edit a podcast on the  iPad and I wasn't allowed to use Fair Right, I'd probably use Final Cut, not Logic, because that's,  I'm not a musician and that's not what it's for. It's not, it's not their fault, right? Like that's  what that app is for. It's, we were just sneaking in there and trying to use it for things it wasn't  intended for, but Final Cut, I was really impressed. I think there's a lot of room for it to grow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but I think it's a good start. And if you were a musician, you might have a different, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  opinion of Logic for them, right? Like, I mean, I can't wait to see what musically inclined people  say about Logic on the iPad because I've seen enough of Logic to know, like, I'm very impressed  with what they put in there, but also it's literally all the features that I turn off on Mac. So I'm  not, I'm not going to give the answer there. I look forward to the official musician reviews of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Logic on the Mac. If you're editing, uh, audio, there are far better tools. Fair-Eight's a great  one, but they're far better tools, even on the Mac. So it's kind of, but you know what? You have  Logic. The difference is you paid once for Logic, probably if you're like me years ago, a very long  time ago. This would be different. You'd have to pay either $5 a month or $50 a year to use it. So  it's, it's not. Fair-Eight's 20 bucks, iPad users, 20 bucks. And out the door, done.  Uh, actually you say 30 in your article, 30 or 20.  Is it 30? Oh yeah. Okay. So it changes. It's free. And then there's an in-app purchase. It must be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  30. And then what they do is actually you get those features forever. And then the next time  he does the complicated thing, that's actually, I think the best way to do software purchases in  the app store, but it's complicated, which is, you know, the next version will come out and there'll  be an in-app purchase for existing users. That'll be smaller, but new users will have to pay more.  And it's like, this is why everybody's given up and done subscriptions, but the guy who does  Fair-Eight has not done that. So it's free to use. And then if you want to unlock the premium  features, it's yeah, I guess a $30 in-app purchase, still a bargain, like the best  bargaining, a nonlinear audio editor that you're ever going to see on any platform, I think, other  than free above free, it's pretty, $30 is pretty cheap. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah, there's the pricing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $30. Right. It's complicated. It's like Fair-Eight's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  two pro, Fair-Eight three pro. Like this is why people don't do this. This is why they just do subs  instead, because the app store is so unfriendly to developers who want to do a traditional kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of upgrade model. Yeah. Well, good. I, you know, I think, um, is there a trial period? No, you can't  just try before you buy it. It's a 30 day trial. Oh, there is. Oh, good. Yeah. Okay. Fantastic.  Um, Alex, did your people have anything to say about, you know, it, not everyone, all of us, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  still trying to download it. Uh, you know, the, it came out today. One thing that Apple is, I think,  trying to prove is that they're not giving themselves any special treatment because you can't  even search for it on the store. Like you search for final cut and then like, no. And, and so I  finally found the article about final cut and then it said, Oh, no, you have to upgrade. So I've been  slowly trying to get my, my iPad ready to download it. So we haven't, I know a couple of people  have been playing with it. Um, uh, so, uh, fully bias, uh, who's in our, in office hours was doing  like a live stream of who's going to edit a music video this morning, but I was prepping for the  show. So I didn't see it, but, but the, um, uh, but he's, but so I think a bunch of people are  jumping into it. I think it's going to be really interesting. I'm, there's a lot of curiosity as to  whether the, this code eventually becomes final cut. Yeah. So I think it's going to be interesting.  I think it's going to be interesting to see whether the code eventually becomes final cut. Like, you  know, are we going to just see this become the desktop version, you know, that's, you know, that,  that eventually is just installed once on, you know, like, like other apps that are M one that  they'll just install onto a, onto a Mac mini or a computer or on your iPad. And it's just one, one  code base, um, wouldn't, you know, two years from now, you know, or something like that, whether  code, but it looks interesting. I mean, I think that, uh, I'm still trying to figure out where  I'll use either one of these because I need all the features that generally are in there, uh,  for both of them. So, um, one question for Jason, does it support the plug plugins? I mean, does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  support third party plugins? Uh, so the story there is varied, right? Like there are audio plugins that  are supported in iPad, OS, like audio units in terms of final cut. There are apples given a kind  of a hazy story about plugins where there's like, they've got content and they've got, uh, that  there's something coming. Like, I feel like it's very much like there's a little post-it note on  that part of the product. It's like check back later. So I honestly, I think that it's all in  the planning stages, but that they launched this product. Obviously it's like, they just decided  that now was the time to get it out there and now they can start that process. But so like on the  audio side, uh, if somebody has released audio units for iPad and a few people have, you can use  those as audio plugins. And then, um, like, does the isotope stuff work in isotope does not believe  that the iPad is a platform. So no, um, not like I would love that. Cause that's what I use. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I was like, I don't think I can do a podcast without, without RX. Yeah. Like I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you. I pre-process and the answer for people who wonder how do I edit on iPad? The  answer is I pre-process all my audio files on the Mac and then I send them to my iPad for editing.  Right. Because isotope is not on the iPad. And then, yeah. So, and on the final cut side, like,  I think they want there to be a lot more content on both of those apps actually, in terms of  available stuff from Apple and from third parties, which would include plugins. But, you know, it's  early days for that, but they did. It was a couple of years ago, they put, um, audio units three on  the platform and I have some, um, that I can use inside ferrite and other places and like fab  filters make some pretty good, like compressors for the iPad and they work great, right? It's  just that you're, if you rely on a particular vendor like isotope and they seem to be completely  clueless about the existence of the iPad, then it's not so great. Right. And that's where we are  with that. I hope this might actually be a spurred isotope to finally get with the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of surprised. I thought there was a standard plugin architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's audio units three. It is standard, but you have to, in order to sell it on the iPad,  you actually have to make at least a wrapper app and put it in the app store. And isotope doesn't  sell in the app store. They only sell it via their own thing. They've got like a proprietary  subscription management thing on the Mac that you have to run. And it's a whole,  like, I think there's a cultural problem at, at, at isotope, but I hope they change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Also there was a, there's a final cut, a new final cut was released for the Mac as well.  So, you know, there's an update to that. Is that for feature parity or?  Uh, I don't think so. I think it does allow the, some versions of round tripping, you know,  so you import a project, you can't send it to the iPad, but you can take it from the iPad.  So if you start a project on your iPad, I think the iPad has less features always  than the desktop version. So you can bring your iPad version in and continue it,  which is kind of cool because that means you're going to be on the road. You shoot a bunch of  stuff, you start working on it, and then you come home and you dump it into, uh, into the full  version of final cut and, and go from there. I think it's got also some HDR stuff, some new titles  and effects and, uh, a screen removal, a scene removal mask, uh, to remove backgrounds, which I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  haven't played with yet. So that those, it's funny because those features got announced for the iPad  and people are like, Oh, those aren't in the Mac. Is there going to be a bifurcation? And the answer  is no, no, there's an update today on the Mac that adds all those features. Those are all there.  You mentioned HDR. I will say one of the really interesting uses, uh, of this, uh, final cut on  the iPad is I think a lot of people, I mean, if you've got a MacBook pro, then you've got a pretty  good HDR screen. But like, if you don't, or if you're out in the field having an iPad, that's got  that full on HDR display and iPad pro, uh, 12.9 while you're editing HDR video or looking at HDR  video, that's pretty powerful, right? That the, in your hand, you've got that HDR preview monitor.  That's also an editor, uh, that you can then take back home and import into the Mac side. That's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pretty good story. Yeah, that's great. I mean, I know when I'm testing HDR, one of the first places  I look is an iPad. I just opened it up when I'm, you know, we're, we're slowly moving, yeah. Yeah.  We're slowly moving office hours to HDR. And, and, and, and so I, I'm constantly opening it up and  watching the stream to see if, you know, if it's actually turning out and so being able to see it  when you're, especially in the field, it's kind of amazing. Yeah. My iPad pro is the best screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got the entire house and whenever I'm editing something, a photo that's taken me like two or  three days to edit, I'm really proud of it. The last thing I check is I'm just going to open it  up on my iPad because if it looks, if it, if it looks good there, I'm not going to accept anybody's  complaints that that doesn't look good on their screen because you need to get a better screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gizer nerd in our discord says he did not have trouble finding either app. So I think maybe  they've updated the search index now. So it's a little easier to find it. He also answered a  question I had. One of the things I loved about logic on the Mac was it had all sorts of  gigabytes of instruments. He says when he installed logic on the iPad, it prompted him  to install, install three different musical instrument packages, classical,  electronic, and hip hop, about 600 megabytes. That's still far short of the  total available instrument packages, but it shows you can install them. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's part of that post-it note, right? You can choose to install those at launch and then you  can choose which ones and Apple says, you know, more to come basically from Apple and also from  third parties. But you know, it's, it's, it's day one of these essentially. So there will be more.  And like when Alex and I are complaining about isotope, I really do believe that  all our complaints about Apple not being present on its own pro iPad platform with its pro apps.  Now that it's there, I hope one of the side effects is going to be that some developers that  kind of poo pooed it are like, okay, all right. Now that you've got logic and file, all right,  we'll get in the app store. And I hope that happens. I hope so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, sometimes, I mean, it depends on how important Apple decides that is,  how important they decide that having that feature is because if developers don't move over,  sometimes Apple just develops it for them. Yeah. Like, Hey, we need this.  It's always the threat. Yeah.  Or they promote, or they promote another, you know, suddenly something that is your  direct competitor is being promoted on the part of the platform that you're not supporting,  you know? And so those are the kinds of things that happen when you don't pay attention. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's available now. You can download a Final Cut Pro for the iPad. If you have an M1  or M2 iPad Pro, or if you have an 11 inch M1 iPad Air, it does require the M processor.  Right? I think that was, yeah. So somebody in our chat room is saying, I don't have,  I have a regular iPad and I don't see it in the search index.

That way they know you saw it here, melissa.com slash tweet. It was a very big  quarter for switchers. This is a report from CIRP. C-I-R-P. I don't know how you pronounce that. CIRP.  After a report last week about how long Apple users are keeping their iPhones,  CIRP is out today with another study digging into how many new iPhone buyers in the U.S. are coming  from Google's platform. This is from 9to5Mac. The new survey shows Apple is attracting the most  switchers from Android it's seen in the past five years. So the steep price not scaring people off,  although Apple does now offer a variety of price points. Largest number of folks switching to iPhone  in the last five years, 15% of new iPhone owners saying my last phone was an Android.  That's up 4% over last year, 5% higher than 2020 and 2021.  2% of new iPhone buyers say they came from a basic phone.  So basic. Or other or were the first time smartphones. Yeah, a kin. That's very basic.  Yeah, you know, I would like to have a kin. Yeah. So I don't know what that means. What do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that that was that say about the market? It probably says that Apple's doing a really good  job reaching into countries that have been primarily Android based. That means that they're  selling more phones in India. They're selling more phones in in Southern Asia, South Asia,  all these. It's not. I don't think there's so much sudden all of a sudden convincing a lot of people  in the United States of America to dump their Samsung phones for iPhones. But it really does  show that a market that they were under had a reduced ability to compete in. Now they're  figuring out we're building phones that a comply with local laws that are that makes sense for the  consumers in that market. And that's they're they're seeing the numbers to prove that, hey,  they continue to find people who have who do not have iPhones yet, and they're going to get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's also I don't know, is this wrong to say? Not on this show, but that the  Android phone is the phone you get when either you don't care or you don't get to choose. And  that if you get to choose, you get the iPhone. I actually think that it's it's if you don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or you care a lot. So I think that the thing is, is that people who buy the low end ones don't  care. They just want a phone. My mom is like that. The then the high end ones are the people who are  really particular. They want they have very specific needs. So they want to push, you know,  they want to customize it in a way that Apple is not going to let you customize it. So I think that  Android does have the two ends of that. Apple has folks that just want it to work. And they're not  as I think a lot of times the high end Android user is much more passionate about what the phone  can do than than an iPhone user. You know, they're they really want to push the outer envelope.  They want to do those things with an iPhone user. I think a lot of times they just want to be easy.  It's like if it's not quite if the camera isn't quite the same as the Android,  but all the other stuff works really well. I don't have to think about it that much. I think that a  lot of them a lot an average iPhone user just wants it to be in the background, not in the  foreground. And I think that that's a distinction between but I think the high end Android user is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  probably more particular than that. That's that's convincing. In fact, Ghalia in our chat room,  who's Israeli, says she buys Android phones because she can customize them. She can you can  fiddle with them. You can tweak them. Yeah. Yeah. It also feels like we're in a real,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, there is such a fight for market share and a fight for mind share between iOS and Android.  And I feel like we're in a place now where iOS and Android are here. They're not going anywhere.  And there's kind of an ebb and flow that's going to happen where different markets like Andy said,  different markets are going to come in that are not very iPhone and they're going to get a little  more iPhone and that'll be good for Apple. And that there are other markets where it's going to be.  Is there a hot phone? Right? Like, is there a hot phone or a hot phone maker that drives sales to  one way or the other? I think Apple is always talking about, I mean, in the US where Apple's  maybe over 50% market share, it's a little bit harder for them to pick up users. But like,  this is not a scenario where Apple is so dominant in any country that they can't pick up market  share. So they'll pick it up here and there and then they'll lose it here and there. Right. And  I think that that's that's sort of the steady state of of the smartphone market we seem to be  in now where it's like, you know, you pick your poison. And I think there's truth to it. There are  people who there are two reasons like I know people who have Android phones. And one reason is that  they hate Apple. And the other reason is they looked at the price of the deal on the Android  phone and the iPhone and they're like, this is way cheaper. And I don't care. Right. Like, because if  it's way cheaper and you and you do care, you'll find a way to get to an iPhone, I think. But if  you don't care, then then obviously you can get a much better deal down at the lower end of the line,  not even the low, low, but just lower end with an Android phone. So I don't know. It feels like  I know they compete, but like it doesn't feel like it's just sort of a two different worlds and not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a war anymore. The one that I think concerns Google the most is the fact that the so many  kids under under 18 are using iPhones. Like it is it is a it's like a crank. I don't know what I saw.  I saw another report this week. It was like 88 percent. Yeah. Like that. It's a really high  number. And I talked to my kids about it. And it's, you know, it's the it's the bubble.  One of the reasons. What Andy talks about is like no one wants to be no one in high. No one in school  wants to be have a green bubble, like because everyone's like, oh, don't don't include them in  the group. Like then they have to go to snap. It's also that that generation lacks the antipathy to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple. The older people sometimes have my daughter, 30 hates Apple. And the reason she has an Android  phone is because she refuses to buy an Apple device. And why does she hate Apple? You know,  I don't know if there's anything Apple can do about this, because some of what people don't  like about Apple is Apple users, not Apple. Right. There's there's this sense, you know,  the guy who has the notch carved into his his hair, you know, there's this sense that Apple,  the cult of Mac is that, you know, weirdos and out of control and that kind of thing. I, I,  I think that that doesn't happen under 18 so much. That's, that's a kind of leftover from the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the old days. I mean, that's been there since the 70s, I feel like on one level and you can point,  I think some people point to it and some people ignore it. And certainly people talk about the  cult of Apple and the cult of Mac and they've been doing that forever. And I just kind of roll my  eyes. Those people like, you know, like what you like and, and, and dislike what you don't like.  And I think kids, even today, I mean, I've got two kids in college now and, you know, I, there's  still ways to line it up. I mean, for gamers, you know, if you're a gamer, the, the Mac is never  going to be on your, your agenda, but maybe, but then for your smartphone, maybe you don't care.  And so you see a lot of, I know a lot of my son's friends are, they've got a Windows PC for gaming  and they've got an iPhone and that's just how they live. And I hate to break it to Mac users. And I  know this is Mac break weekly, but if you do the math, it's impossible for there to be more  iPhone users who are Mac users than there are iPhone users who are Windows users. Just let that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sink in. My, my, my son has an iPhone and, and he just finished building his own PC. So, so he's,  you know, and which I proudly supplied the hardware for him to, for him to put it together.  And so, you know, I definitely agree that and he's, and he got it specifically because he wants to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Microsoft's aware of the fact that there are a lot of iPhone users because this week,  Windows announced the, your phone or phone link, I guess they call it now for, that will work for  iOS. It's not as complete as the Android version, probably because of limitations on iOS, but I tried  it on Windows weekly last week and I set up my iPhone to work on my Windows PC and you can see  messages. You can get notifications. You can send messages. You know, it's effectively, you're using  Apple's messages on your, on your Windows PC. You can even make calls. So the only thing you really,  it doesn't do is, is the running applications. You can, on Android, you can actually run an  Android application windowed on your Windows PC running off your phone. And I can see why that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not possible with an iPhone. That just shows how different, what a different business that  Microsoft is in. They are, they are the, the, the gears in the grease that powers business. So it's,  it's 100% in their best interest to make sure that they can support a, bring your own device  strategy if a company wants to support that. So it's, it's, it's just, it's, it's so hard to compare  the two directly in any sort of way, shape or form these days, because it really does depend on what  environment are these people in? What country are they in? What kind of money they have to spend?  I'm really keen to see this generation of kids who has, who have iPhones. How, how long are they  going to, are they going to continue to be loyal Apple iPhone users when they get well out of  college and now they have to buy their first phone themselves? Are they going to, are they  going to settle for something that is still an iPhone, but not the top of the line? Or they're,  or are they going to say, you know what, for the amount of money I'm going to spend on the middle  tier iPhone, I could get a central, I could get something that is, that is flagship grade in a  pixel line or in a Samsung line. So I don't, I don't know, but I'm not telling them what to do.  I'm just, it's an interesting piece of sociology to examine. Yeah, it'd be interesting. I think the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hard part with all of these things is the lock in on either side. So you really have to make a choice.  I mean, I think that if you grow up on an iPhone, it's really hard to, you got a whole bunch of  apps. It's not just the cost of the computer and the cost of the phone, but the cost of everything  else that's related to it and all, you know, comfort and everything else. So I think that it's a,  I mean, that's why everyone's, that's why there's a lot of talking, a lot of articles about the  number of kids that are using one platform is that they're like, it's, it's pretty hard to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people to reverse it, reverse trajectory at that point. Yeah. But to a great extent, so long as it  can run Tik Tok, so long as it can run a bunch of popular apps that are multi-platform, a lot of  people are pretty good. It's, I don't think, I don't think that's as big a deal. Even, even on my,  even on my MacBook, even when I'm not really thinking about being platform agnostic,  it's really, really hard to get me so locked in that that would become a really, really big,  really, really big disincentive to switch from one to the other. The thing that really is a big  disincentive is just that three weeks it will take not to relearn something, but just to  retrain my thumb that no, that's not how you, how you switch from one app to another. I know exactly  how you do it, but I'm still, I'm still stuck to doing it, doing it the old way. So as long as people  have something that works, they're kind of apt to stick with it. I understand, Andy, because your

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thumb is really untrainable. You have a very, it's an average, it's unbroken, it's untrained. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a yes thumb. That's why I have it on staff to challenge me, you know, to be that, be that, that,  that fly in the ointment that gets us to rethink our whole strategy. Yes, he's a pain in the butt,  but you know what? We need more thumbs like that. He's a wild thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, you know what? Good news. If you are an iPhone user, France is fighting,  fighting for you. Yeah. To save your iPhone from an early death. That's the kind of kooky  wired headline. Actually, it's an Ars Technica article from Wired. So they're all conding assed.  It's all the same. French prosecutors have launched an investigation into the scourge  of planned obsolescence, says Morgan Meeker. Actually, I'm, I'm with them. What they really want  is at least that you could change your battery for crying out loud, but it's all right to repair.  Um, this is an article quoting Alexander, Alexandre Isaac, CEO of the Repair Academy,  which is a renowned research and training group, according to Wired, that runs the Toulouse  technicians workshop. Every time a new iPhone's released, his team finds another part that has  been locked to work only with a specific Apple device. First, it was a cheap on the motherboard,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  then the list of parts. This isn't like a government agency, right? This is just a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  brand press release and Ars picked it up. I think that's what it is. This is a, no, this is,  it's a little bit, it's a little bit more in depth than that. It's a Paris prosecutor who has  decided to take action. It's, it's, well, it's, it's more along the lines of a Senator who has  proposed a bill and, and, and, you know, it's not going to, it's going to go into committee and  then it's going to die in committee. But the Senator decided to write this bill so they can,  they can get the message out there that they're very much for this thing.  Although the thing is, this is France and, uh, it's a very, very socialist country and there are a  lot, and they have done from our perspective, goofier things than order, order a phone company  to say, hi, you've got to re-engineer your entire platform because we feel as though you're abusing  the power of the people to do what they need to do in order to, in order to tolerate their phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  very, very well. So contention is that Apple essentially is built into its phones, planned  obsolescence, uh, because you're not using standard parts. It's not easy to fix these phones.  Um, and so it's a Parisian prosecutor who's investigating, uh, I don't, I don't know if  that's going to, he's delegated the investigation to France's department of competition consumer  affairs and fraud prevention. They could fine Apple. Um, and in fact, France was the one that  introduced that, uh, repairability scoring system, you know? Yeah. And they're also on the case for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh, locking serial numbers for basically having to, you can't just simply buy a battery or buy a  screen or buy a camera sensor and plug it in there. It has to be coded for that device for security  reasons, of course, and not for reasons to prevent you from, uh, from getting your device fixed for  one fourth or one third of the cost. Uh, and I, as always, I'm not sure what the curve, what the  most correct answer is. I, I, in principle, I think that you should be able to fix everything  on your own or hire somebody you want to, to fix it. I think you should be able to get any,  any component you need to and replace it yourself or hire someone to replace it for yourself.  On the other hand, a phone, boy, you can't, you can't make these things out of Lego and still be  able to put it in your pocket and take it out again. But if, by any, by any measure,  I'm glad that government agencies are, uh, are at least willing to, to challenge Apple and say,  hi, you're going to have to present documentary evidence to, to, to back up your assertion that  the way that you build the iPhone is best for everybody, including yourselves, including the  consumers, because we've had several years of all, every manufacturer saying, oh no, no, no, yes.  No, we're, we, we, we won't. The thing is we're, we're, we're concerned about people buying  counterfeit printer cartridges and then breaking their, their printers that are out of warranty.  We're protecting the user by blocking them into our own super, super overpriced consumables. Like,  okay, go ahead and say that, but now you're going to have to swear an oath under penalty of perjury  and actually demonstrate that you are actually telling the truth. So that's why I'm not against  these kinds of investigations and these kinds of queries. Yeah, I have mixed feelings. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you're right. I don't want, uh, uh, any government regulator to specify how a phone should be built,  but I do think right to repair is a reasonable thing to demand to ask. So I don't know what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  answer is. This story pushes on all my buttons. And I'm like, if I back off of it, I'm like,  you know what? Right to repair is good. Having, having governments say, you know, Apple, there is  a line you can't cross in terms of what, what was said before the idea that, uh, yes, you want to  protect the consumer from counterfeit parts. No, you don't want to erect a barrier that allows you  to charge a ridiculous amount of money for the official parts so that people don't bother and  they just buy a new phone, right? Like you want to find a way to say yes to the one and no to the  other. And, and some regulation can do that. At the same time, I am reminded that France is the place  where for several years, Apple had to sell the iPhone inside a larger box that contained a pair  of ear pods because there was a French law that said all phones, I'm not going to do the French  accent, must come with a hands-free kit because of, you know, woo, scary cell phone, uh, radiation.  When the world had moved on to all sorts of other kinds of headphones in France, you got a phone in  a box in a box. And that first box contained a phone in a box and a pair of headphones.  That's the sort of thing where you look at the regulations and you're like, well, that's ridiculous,  but they move so slowly and they're, you know, right? So I, I get, I love what's at the core  of this, which is in the end, you should be able to replace the battery on your phone. And Apple  has been forced by others. Apple has been moving in that direction. And I think that's good.  And we need more of that because the irony here is you talk about, uh, an early death and yet  Apple's support for old hardware in their current OS is, is second to none, right? Apple expects  those phones to last. It's part of their business strategy. They want you to sell  back your old phone so they can sell it to somebody else. Right. So it's, uh, it's a bit much to say  planned obsolescence, but right to repair. Yeah. I'm all for it. It's just super obnoxious when

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're, they're coding things like batteries and screens. It's like, okay, at that point,  you really are just unnecessarily making things more difficult for third party repair people.  Oh, we can all agree that HP's requirement that you subscribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to the HP ink renewal service in order to print with your printer is anti-competitive,  but it feels like there's ways you could prosecute that without saying, you know, I mean, there's the,  I think you're right. There's a line in the sand and you should make that a reasonable line.  Yeah. Uh, I want to drink some delicious AG1 if you don't mind, let's take a little break for our  sponsor.

June 5th will be a lot more fun. Rehydrate, rehydrate, you gotta pace yourself. You gotta

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pace yourself. I know it's a long race. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft had one keynote that was so long. They had a yoga trainer come out and help people stretch  in the intermission. You didn't have to do that this time, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there should have been some notes during that reversal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Keep it short. Keep it short. All right, moving right along with the program.  Let's talk about June 5th. We're going to see, I think,  Glenn Fleischman notwithstanding. We're going to see VR helmet of some kind.  It's ski goggles. It's ski goggles. That's the metaphor for the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope it's a helmet. I hope it's a helmet with a big spirally antenna just sticking out from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  top. I think it should coin the phrase which I hope becomes standard of nerd helmet. I think  that's what we should all call it from now on. Go ahead, Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it should also filter the air and just be a whole like Dyson does.  I think you do a whole Daft Punk look and just have it all there. I think that would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's do a voice changer in it too so you can be like Bane.  Right? You're like, oh, Batman, I hope you're enjoying my raffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a man of my word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The M1 available for $299.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The name no longer has any meaning for me.  From 9 to 5 Mac, Apple has now trademarked at least five different names  for whatever this new operating system will be.  Keep us guessing.  XROS, RealityOS, RealOS, Reality ProOS, and XRPROOS have all been trademarked, but Mark  Ehrman says he's pretty sure it's going to be XROS. That's going to be the official name.  Because it feels very unengaged.  Mixed reality.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I feel like RealityOS makes more sense.  Yeah.  It's more Apple-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But remember that this is the company that said, okay, so we're creating a brand new music player.  It plays music, lots and lots of music. What are we going to call it? The iPod.  That's what we're going to go with.  Good point.  And the thing is, just like the iPad was not, hey, we're not going to call it the tablet.  We sure mocked iPad.  The iMobile.  It's late.  But we got used to it.  Yeah. Well, we got used to it.  No, but yeah. I mean, Apple Watch is probably the most, the iPhone and the Apple Watch are  probably the two most logical things they've come up with so far. But we have a device like  a virtual reality headset that's going to be simply the launching off point for a whole line of  what they hope to be smaller and more practical and reasonable augmented reality things.  You could understand if they wanted to have something that was very, very malleable so that  they could use it to attach the next five or six years worth of products to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gizer Nerd says XROS kind of stumbles off the end of the tongue, then tumbles down the stairway,  breaks its neck.  JammerBee says, if we're going to call it Nerd Helmet, JammerBee says we should call it Tenros,  which I hope does not become... Go ahead, Alex. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's it. That's all. I think XR is too hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, you kind of expect the word Windows to be in front of those two. Hey,  I'm excited about Windows XR. It's a version of Windows 10 specifically for risk-based... Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Apple already did the iPhone XR, right? So they've already been, they broke that one.  I don't know. I like Reality OS. I know that it's a mouthful, but it does what it says on the tin  in a way that XR... Maybe one day we'll all be like, oh yes, XR, the XR revolution happened in 2023.  Right now it's sort of like the what now? VR people know and AR people know, but XR,  it's like too clever by half, but we'll get used to it if that's what it is, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gurman has in his newsletter pointed out that pretty much every Apple executive  has now peed on the XR headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ew. Is that some sort of like rite of passage? Marking the responsibility for Apple's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the list of names includes Johnny Ive, for crying out loud. He's not even there anymore.  Mike Rockwell, who's been in charge of it since 2016, he helped craft the vision,  according to Gurman, for the headset and the technology development group itself.  Apple COO Jeff Williams, a driving force behind the headset's development for the last few years.  Dan Riccio, Rockwell's boss, the conduit between the technology development group  and the top executives. He has worked exclusively on the headset over the last two years.  I mean, that's a lot of manpower, a lot of top level executives to devote  to a product that isn't even out yet. Paul Mead, who's Rockwell's most senior lieutenant,  handling hardware engineering for the device. Fletcher Rothkopf and Ray Chang, report to Mead.  Johnny Ive, although no longer at Apple, pushed the company to avoid designs that isolated you  from the outside world. He lobbied for a more portable design, no external base station.  He probably didn't like the idea. I think we've heard this is going to be the case that there is  an external battery attached. Jaws, company's marketing chief, one of the biggest proponents  of the headset on the executive team. Phil Schiller, Jaws' predecessor. Frank Casanova,  head of marketing for the headset. We know Casanova has been there forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see. But that makes sense. Apple doesn't do skunkworks projects.  No, this is not. Everything they do, the top level of Apple people are always in on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Feels like all hands on deck though. Let's put all the wood in these arrows or whatever it is  they say. Jeff Norris, Johnny Scheruji, Shannon Gans, Jeff Stahl. I mean, it's just a who's who  of Apple executives. John Hodgman, John Hodgman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about, I mean, this thing's been going on for what, seven, eight years now. So when I read  stories about the executives here, I also had that thought of like, they say, oh, well, Johnny  Scheruji was really grumpy about this and called it the science project. Okay. When was that 2015?  Right. Was that 2017? Was that last week? Like we don't know. And the story behind that too is that  at one point they conceived of this thing having like a little box, like the PSVR has a PlayStation  and the little box did all the work. And then it just sent the images wirelessly to the headset,  made the headset lighter. And apparently they built a processor for that and then they killed it. And  they're like, no, no, we're not going to do it. We're going to do it all on device. So like,  if I were Johnny Scheruji and that happened, I would be grumpy about it. Right. But that isn't,  so it's very easy. Somebody in the, in the discord just said, does anybody at Apple like this thing?  Why are they even coming out with it? And the answer is, I feel like what we're getting is the  story of seven years of development of a thing that was like going to be one thing. Then it was  going to be a different thing. Then they couldn't do that. So they made it a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the question, Jason, have they now converged? Do they all agree now that this is the right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at the right time? I will see that if they, if they're releasing it, I think they probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  converged on something only because, you know, Apple's not afraid of killing things. Like they're  not like, they'll put a lot of money. You know, I've heard stories of them spending hundreds of  millions. This is billions, but they're almost a decade into Project Titan, the car, Apple car.  Right. And they, you know, they, yeah, I think that it, and it does really feel like we're getting  gaslit, you know, like it's, there's a lot of like lowering expectations of everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, so they're telling people don't expect much. Yeah. This is just a developer unit. Don't expect.  And then you think Alex, we will be blown away a week from Monday. If they release it, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's going to be pretty impressive. Like, I don't know, you know, I don't know who we've blown away,  but I think if they release a product, you know, related to this, it's going to be, it's going to be  probably the best headset that's been released so far. Is it going to make it be enough to turn it?  But I think it's probably going to, I don't think Apple is going to release something that said,  well, it's almost as good as Oculus. I think that that's not going to be the case. So I think that  as far as commercially available headsets, this is probably going to be the top of the line.  I totally, I think it's a, I think that they'll, I think that there's certain numbers that they  have to hit, you know, and I think that that's probably, um, 90 frames a second, six K per eye.  Like, I think that that's like a, you know, a number that they probably have to get to,  because, you know, the other ones are, a lot of them are floating in that range or, or, you know,  and so I think that, um, and I think that really the, what makes it, you know, the, the good enough  for what, you know, the first release is probably, you know, 90, 96 frames, you know, six K per eye.  The knock our socks off is eight or 10 K per eye at 120 frames a second. That's like everyone,  they'll sell as many as they can make, like, you know, that's, that's, and so, and so, and I don't  think, I think that that's probably not the first version, but I think that if they, if they came out,  at that level, it will, it will be the thing that everybody wants to put on. It feels like their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  strategy here is very clearly release the best consumer or commercial, widely available VR thing  that could be made, right? And it's going to be too expensive and they're not going to sell that  many of them, but clearly they've decided rather than make, cause they could have shifted gears  again and made the thing that we hear is coming in a year or two, which is the cheaper version.  They're going out with this. And I think the reason is they want to, they want to not only claim some  territory here, but they also want to set the bar and they want to say, this is what a VR AR  experience is. And if, if they are clearly better and with these prices, I think we're going to,  that are rumored, I think that's what it's going to be. If they can clearly say, we made the best one,  anything less than this is not good enough until we come out with one, at which point we'll change  it. That's what their strategy is, whether it'll work or not, I think is a, is a real question,  but I think that that's what they've decided to do is say, we're going to define this category

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and try to beat us. I think, I think that Apple's going to be going the exact opposite in the  strategy that they did with the Apple watch. I think that maybe even just in retrospect, but  with Apple watch, so long as they got the hardware right, so long as they designed a very beautiful,  elegant watch that did not look like a gadget watch was small enough that the first conversation  you have with anybody when you enter a room is what the hell is that thing on your wrist?  The software can come a little bit later, as long as it tells the time and has a stopwatch,  you can, they'll sell, they'll sell enough of them to get to the next iteration of the software.  I think here they're in the opposite sort of boat. So long as they get the software right,  or at least show the potential of what they've got going on with here is we think the operating  system is going to be for here is, here is the sort of experiences and features and functions  we want to enable through not only the stock apps, but through what developers can do with it.  The first generation of buyers are going to be okay with essentially the Apple Lisa version of  the headset. I don't think that they're going to be able to stake out the term that, oh, this is  absolutely the best headset that is possible to be made. It's like, well, it's still too heavy.  It still has this clunky battery thing. It's not possible just today.  Well, it's still, but then someone will say, well, here's what other makers have been making for  enterprise that are actually don't have some of these problems because they've been iterating.  They've already been iterating for two or three or four years. That's not saying that month for  failure, but that's just saying that I really think that Apple's story is going to be all about  the software and all about the operating system. Even if $3,000 is setting us up to  be really, really excited about a $2,000 price tag, a $2,000 price tag is still way too much  for anybody but a real motivated enthusiast or somebody who is going to write an app and make  that money back from this app they're going to make for themselves, for this feature that they're  going to build for this thing. So they really are not in a position where they have to make something  that wins the hearts and minds of everybody. It's not going to be a practical thing for  in any way, shape or form. Once that is sort of the pressure is off, it comes down to how fun is  it? How did you design the theater app so that when I'm watching iTunes content, when I'm watching  Apple TV content, how fun is it to watch Apple TV content with it? If you decide, if you,  the game developers that you've had that have been, sorry, the game developers who have had access to  these APIs already probably now for a couple of months, when they show up that first game,  how cool is that game? And when someone comes up with something that's actually functional and  practical, is that going to say, this is not going to change my life? This productivity thing is not  going to justify the two to $3,000. But I can see how, yeah, the next iteration of this hardware,  that's a little bit less expensive, a little bit lighter, a little bit more practical, is definitely  going to be something that wants me to put $1,500 under my mattress for 2024.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kyle Siversky Yeah, and I think that they can get away with a lot when they, by calling it the  developer edition. So if you're going to release it at WWDC, call it the developer edition. This is  just for developers. And so people might even have to pay $100 extra to buy it. You know, like you  have to be a developer. I mean, they may just limit it to developers, which is millions of people.  And the most likely wants to pay that kind of money anyway. But I think that I think,  I think it's hard to make these. And I think that even at $3,000 or $2,000, whatever that number is,  they'll make, they'll sell as many as they can make, you know, like, you know, I don't think that,  I think that it's, they don't have the capacity to probably put out a huge volume of them as it is,  just because they're very complicated and they're right on the outer edge of what's possible.  I do think you're gonna probably see a pretty big lineup of partners. So I'm gonna guess there's  gonna be lots of slides with lots of logos on it. And they're gonna say, we have hundreds of people  that have already been working on this. And we've got blah, blah, blah, you know, like that's gonna  be, you know, like they're gonna, if it's Apple, they're gonna show this big, you know, group of  people that are that have already been built building things. I think that we're gonna see  some things that have been running for a while that just happened to work on it. Like the Amazon,  I don't know if you, if you buy something on a phone, on your iPhone, it'll, it'll ask you,  Hey, do you want to see this in your house? You know, like for a lot of things. And I think that  they're gonna show they're gonna show that stuff, you know, being able to throw that on and be able  to walk around a house with, you know, the stuff from, I wouldn't be, I would be really surprised  if we don't see a Kia Home Depot, Amazon, you know, like those ones showing, you know, you could walk  around your house with all the new furniture that you just bought and just feel like you're there.  And we're going to take the lighting from the location and we're gonna light all the stuff and  put it all together. And there's a bunch of things that it can do that are pretty, that could be,  that it could do that, that would be pretty interesting. So, so I think that those are the  kind of things that you're going to see. And then you're gonna see a lot of games, you're going to  see a lot of, you know, some, I still think we're going to probably see, you know, the, the office  apps, you know, get activated. And I'd be really interested to see if we get, if we see MLS,  you know, like you, when there's a score, you can go back, if you throw on your headset right now,  this is the big advantage we've talked about before, is the integration of it with all the other  hardware devices that you may have in your house. So it knows where you are in the Apple TV. It  knows where you are on your phone and you can put the headset on and it will immediately jump  into the state that it needs to be in to show you something that was related to what you were just  looking at is really, really important because it's the one of the hardest things to do on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oculus headset. You've stimulated a question that I want to ask all of you. You know, when the iPod  came out, it wasn't, it was evolutionary. It wasn't a amazing technological advancement on existing  MP3 players. It was evolutionary. And the content was, you know, not new. It was just playing the  stuff that you already used to. When the iPhone came out, it was technically revolutionary. It was  the first time we'd seen a pinch and zoom interface. There was a lot of technical innovation  and, you know, the software was because of it, revolutionary. So I'd be very curious, Alex,  two questions, I guess, is this going to be an evolutionary product or a revolutionary product?  Technologies on here that you go, wow, like this foveated vision you were talking about in the  Discord, Jason. And then the kind of follow on, will the content be evolutionary or revolutionary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think, Alex? I think it's all going to be evolutionary. And I think the iPhone was  evolutionary. I think the iPhone did what all other apps had mapped. I mean, I had a trio that  I could check email, I could go on the web, I could do the, you know, I could, I had GPS,  I had almost everything the iPad did. It's just what the iPhone did. The big difference was the  iPhone gave me a new interface for it. You know, it gave me a much sleeker interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the simple slab of glass, nobody done that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one had done that before. But I still, I would still say that the functionality of that phone,  other than that piece of glass, that was, but I would still argue that that wasn't  a huge jump forward. It was just something that, you know, seemed obvious once you saw it.  And then the, and then, but with the, and I agree that the older ones were evolutionary. I think  the iPad, there's already tablets out there. iPad was just a big iPhone. iPad was definitely  evolutionary. Yeah. I think that the, I think that the evolutionary piece of this is that,  you know, Oculus is out there, you know, they've, there's been other things that have been out there  that have shown us a lot of what's possible. But I think that, you know, what Apple's doing-  So this will just be a polished Oculus? Well, no, I think it'll be more than that. I think that,  I think that it'll have, I mean, I think that it's going to have a much higher, I mean, I think  it's going to significantly higher resolution, significantly. So it's a higher resolution with  a higher frame rate, which makes a huge difference. Like it's just, it's hard to describe like  what it, what it means when you can see a higher resolution at a higher frame rate,  it really feels like you're there, you know, and it's hard for people to imagine until you see it,  but it's, it's, it makes a massive difference. And so, but the other thing that I think is,  I wouldn't say revolutionary, but I do think that Apple is building a pipeline for generating new  content that is much more robust than what Oculus has ever had, you know, and I think that that is a  huge limiter to Oculus. Oculus is hard to develop for, you know, and it becomes one of those things  that's really cumbersome to build tools. Apple has been slowly building the tools in the pipeline  for this for five years, you know, that when we watched USDZ come out, when we watched Creator,  you know, Reality, you know, the Reality Converter and the reality, like all these reality tools and  being able to play with it on the phone and do all the things that they're doing, all of those things  become, those are all services that are designed for this headset. Like, you know, like they're not  for the phone, you know, the phone was a place for them to play on it. And so they're, they're  building this, this big apparatus because that has been a huge issue. Like when you want to use an  Oculus, you can't, you know, oh, I have this and now there's something on my keynote that they want  to show me. And if I click on it, I can put this headset on and walk around it and look at it or  rotate it and everything else. That means anybody can create something for, for the headset. You  know, anybody could create potentially something in, in keynote that they can sit there and just  click on these things and they're all popping up and it's an adventure that a teacher can create  or an individual can create for other people or a salesperson. That's the kind of stuff that I think  Apple's going to do that Facebook just doesn't have the tools to do. They don't have the, and so I  think that that's going to be something that's really interesting. And I think  Apple is very committed to it. And I think that we're going to see a lot of,  a lot of different kinds of content. I think that, I think Apple is going to fund  a lot of things that go into this. This is a, this is an all or nothing thing. If they actually  announce it, you know, in two weeks, I think you're going to see, or a little less than two weeks,  you're going to see an enormous amount of, of investment into this, into this  channel because they can't afford to lose. Like they can't, I mean,  they can't afford to have this not, not work. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Andy, what do you think evolutionary revolutionary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, I think that their roadmap is revolutionary. I think that what they're going to show off in  two weeks is evolutionary. I think that they have, I hate to use a buzzword, but it's perfectly  descriptive. They have the longest runway of any company that wants to get into VR and AR.  They can basically have a, they can have a five year plan that is predicated on them making no  real progress for the first couple of years, except for getting everybody primed for version  three of this headset. So if all they do with this first demo is again, show off a really cool  play in terms of packed in apps and things you get for free with the, with the device,  all of your Apple TV stuff, all your iTunes stuff, we've made this really cool theater sort of  thing. And also this really cool environment where you can actually be watching the,  watching the movie or watching the TV show with your friends. And it's like there and your,  and if your friend is quote, sitting on quote to your left, you hear them.  They're, they're making wise comments from, from, from the, from the correct side of your, of your  face. I think that's, that's going to be enough because again, they have enough time to figure out  who's going to be, how, what kind of, what kind of people are buying this, are going to be buying  this stuff? What are they going to be using it for? We know we got games. We know we've got,  we know we have training and, and, and basically collaborative shared experiences.  Do we have something that, that is an iPhone is sort of device? Do we have something that's even  an iPad sort of device where someone changes the way that they work because they have one of these  things? Or the ideal is going to be that someone isn't just, Hey, I've got, I'm the sort of person  who can blow $3,000 today and maybe $1,200 five years from now on this gadget. That looks like a  lot of fun. And at the end of the day, we buy an iPhone because we can see ourselves doing things  that we couldn't do before. We see this going to save, it's going to solve problems for us  and create opportunities. And that's why we spend a thousand dollars on a phone.  So they have five years to figure out how to make that argument to us. I don't think they're going  to be able to make it in the first year, but I do think that they have a five year plan that says  that here is something that you haven't thought of. There's the implications of having a  collaborative environment in which it doesn't matter that everybody has this thing strapped  to their face because no one's actually looking directly at anybody's face to begin with in this,  in this conversation. So evolutionary then revolutionary.  For I am actually going to come, I'm betting on black and white. As long as it's not a double zero,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a winner. Jason, what do you think? Will this just be an evolution of existing hardware  or is it going to have some technologies in it that change things that are superior?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like Andy, I'm going to cheat. I think hardware wise, it's going to be evolutionary,  right? I think none of this, there have been some great videos and articles that have broken  down the rumors about the hardware. We actually got a bill of lading analysis this week, right?  About what the parts are. I think everybody knows what the panels are and what are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all very- Last I saw there were conflicting reports,  the information thought two 8K displays, but the others said two 4K displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's a little lack of clarity, but it's going to be like $1400 or $1400 to $1600  just in parts, right? So it's going to be very expensive, but we know it's going to be pretty  good. And none of that, like Apple is not rumored to have invented a new X for this, right? So it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going to be- Johnny, I've wanted it to have your eyeballs, a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Mark Gurman still thinks that that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I cannot imagine that. I would say that's revolutionary, as stupid as it is. So as dumb  as it is, it's still something nobody ever did or thought of. So it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true. I mean, it could surprise us. We've been talking about this for so long,  and yet they could possibly surprise us, but they're assembling these things in a factory,  so probably not. But what I would say is while the hardware is going to be like a spare no expense  evolution, it's like really nice VR hardware, the revolutionary part, if it's possible,  it'll be in the software and it may not be there or it may be there or we may get a glimmer of it.  But I do agree with Andy that that is where you get some of that secret Apple sauce is what if  Apple releases the thing and we all look at it and go, oh yeah, you know, I've used the PSVR,  I've used a Quest, it's like that. Well, okay, that's not revolutionary, but I do think that  they're behind the scenes for seven years working on this thing. I sure hope there are stuff,  there are things in that demo that we look at that we go, oh wow, oh, what an interesting idea,  right? Like that they have done some stuff that we haven't really seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would consider a foveated view to be unique. Nobody's doing that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think somebody is, I think there's another headset out there that does foveated rendering.  I don't think they're unique. Maybe a high end,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pimax, P-I-M-A-X, but no, whoever heard of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, right, like, so I think the hardware, you know, is going to be really, really good,  but not beyond what we expect the best to be. I do think the wild card is software because I  don't think that that is a field that has been completely tilled, right? Like different people  are trying different things. And if there's a through line through a lot of Apple's successes,  it's not that it was revolutionary, but they had a way to apply the existing tech and their software  to make something that redefined what that product category was. And if they can get away with  something like that in June, that or start getting away with it beginning in June, I think  that would be the thing to look for is just how different is that or what do they always say?  Blow away. It's blow away. They say losing all sense of grammar. That's what I'm intrigued by  because I love the idea that they're going to come out with some stuff for VR that everybody  who's used VR up to now looks at and goes, Oh, that's so much better than what I've seen before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope to see that. Well, and I think that the content is going to be important, like what  content is available, what content is coming out. And I think that that's going to be as important  as the software is. There's plenty of content that a bunch of us have worked on that never saw the  light of day that we were like, this would sell a lot of headsets, but it was really hard to make.  And we have to remember that Apple bought NextVR. So there could be things where you have stereo VR  again in locations at a much higher resolution. And again, the frame rate and resolution are  going to be a big deal. If they turn that corner, there's a lot of things that become very possible  and very interesting that just haven't been there yet in anything that we've seen so far.  And that takes a lot of processing. I think one of the big advantages that Apple has here is  to get back to the software and the hardware is they're making the chips. They're making  every bit. They're making the chips and they're writing the software and they can integrate it  with an iOS, iOS solutions, tvOS solutions, macOS solutions. And being able to have all of those  things integrated into one unified experience where you put that on as part of a bigger experience  that's there is I think it's, you know, Apple may fumble it. I mean, there was the trash can Mac Pro.  When we did the other one, you know, they're like, there are, it's not that they can't do that, but  they've been working on it for so long and they built such a ramp for it. And, you know, I think  that it'll be really interesting. I'm obviously very interested to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And one of the biggest assets they have that no other competitor can even approach is that  they've developed a lot of good credit with their developer community. We talk a lot about how  sometimes Apple underserves their developers, but one thing they always come through with is that  if they tell you that, Hey, we are, we are investing in this direction for here is how  we're going to do cloud sharing. Here's how we're going to do a recite, uh, uh, uh, uh,  multiple displays. Here's how we're going to do X, Y, and Z. Here's our plan for whatever.  If you, if you are excited as a developer about what you could do with these new APIs,  you know that Apple is not going to pull the rug out from under you after two or three years.  They're not going to switch messaging platforms on you because somebody, somebody lost a bet  and someone, someone lost a, ran out of time on their career meter. And now they're the messaging  app that they've been, uh, they've been championing at the, at the company is dead and someone else's  messaging app is coming in instead. So if you feel so, and because Apple also has some of the most  creative and passionate and artistic developers out there, they're exactly the sort of people to,  you know what? I got $3,000. I'm going to buy one of these things because I'm just curious to see  what I could build with this. And then after two or three years, they become like the Omni group.  This company that, uh, did that, uh, a company that does for, uh, Apple VR, what the Omni group  did for next. And then Apple saying, we are not just writing incredibly good and innovative apps.  We're writing incredibly good and innovative apps that uniquely take advantage of what this  hardware and what this operating system, what these APIs can do. So they're, they're in a really,  really good position. I just don't think, I just don't think it's going to, it's going to be for  another couple of years yet. One of the things just to be quick about it is that, uh, with  hardware devices like this, the first thing you have to see is who is manufacturing the sort of  display technology that they're going to need to really pull this off. You're not seeing it. Uh,  who's going to have the sort of camera technology that can make them pull off what we're hoping  that they'll pull off. Nobody's been, no one's been showing that stuff off yet. So we're still  going to be limited to relatively low frame rate, high resolution, but not as high as what we would  like very limited field of view. So there's, there's not a whole lot you can do when you're,  can't give people a peripheral vision. So they're going to be stuck with what they can serve given  the components and given the technology they have available to right now. But, but like I said before,  so long as they say that we've got our software story on lock, we, we've got the, we've basically  prepared this runway. We're not going to get there. We're not going to take off for three,  four or five years, but oh boy, if you've got three grand, you're going to have fun.  You're going to have fun on the steering this plane left and right on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that they may not have a consumer device that's even aimed at the consumer that  even has a production for at least a year, if not two. So the thing is, is that this is going to be  the way you get this is you're a developer and you buy the developer edition, you know, maybe the  only way you buy this for a year or two and they'll still sell millions of those, of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  developer additions. I don't think that the, I don't think that Google Glass is the champion  that they, that anybody wants to emulate, but some of the smart things they did do was this is,  we're calling this the Explorer edition, just like you alluded to before, it's called the developer  edition and we are not basically, we're not putting these on pegs at Best Buy. If you send us an email  and send, make a case for what you would do with this and why you would be useful for us  as we're trying to figure out if this is a thing or not in bit and dribs and drabs,  we will allow you to pay $1,500 for this, for this thing. That means that the first people they got  were people who were either a journalists on expense accounts who really wanted to just rip  on that and get lots of copy out of it, which is fair. This is what we do for a living. But also  people who are invested emotionally and boy, I've always thought this is a technology that  could happen and I'm willing to spend a lot of money for a half baked product because this half  baked product is the best that we have, half baked though it is. So this is why it's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  exciting for the next few years. Yeah. I think that the one, the one challenge is with Google  Glass was that the folks that got into it first were really into it and weren't thinking about  all the impacts that they have on people around them. So it really hit the camera, which was the  coolest part of Google Glass. The fact that you could see the viewfinder right in front of you  and have a camera was amazing. And it's still the best version of that that I've seen so far.  And, but of course people started using them everywhere and it made everybody uncomfortable.  And that was, that was the, I really believe that was the downfall was that camera, but,  but you couldn't take it away because it was the coolest part of the whole, I mean, it's what I use  it's one for the, for Glass, primarily what I used it for was to shoot videos of things right in front  of me where I could point to things or with my kids or with other things, you know, that, that,  you know, I, I, you could create things that you just never were able to create before.  And it's not the same as these little Facebook Ray Bans because I can't see what I'm shooting.  Like I can, I can shoot towards it, but what was great about the glass, the glass is that I could  see what I was shooting. And anyway, it was all it, it's, it's, I, I won't turn this into a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is, this is starting to be one of those great conversations we have when you're staying over at  my house and suddenly realize that, Hey, if you have to leave, if you have to leave for your plane  in eight hours, it was too late. Let's just, let's just stay up all night. But yeah, I keep,  I keep thinking that all Google needed to do was add like a 22 cent piece of plastic,  just a permanent cover for that camera that take it. That's orange. That says that, Oh,  I'm sure you've heard that does have a camera built into it, but as you can see, there's this big block  of orange plastic in front of it that's covering the lens. You don't see anything. It looks like a  lens here. Do you? And of course, I, of course, when I'm taking pictures, I'm playing with my kids.  I'm going to take pictures of a video of me playing with my kids without I flip it up and that's what  you can see. But, Oh no, of course, of course, the last thing Google wants to do is make you worry  that when you're talking to me, that you're being, Oh dear, 22 cents. I go 3d printer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  22 cents, 18 minutes. Beautiful. Let's not forget that Google Glass was more than 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It was so great. It was, you know, I think it was great. I loved it. The Google,  you know, Apple had the Newton message pad before they had the iPhone and the iPad.  This, I think that this is, there could be an analogy here where Google Glass had a lot of great  ideas. It was before its time. And maybe there's going to be, maybe part of the problem is going  to be we, the generation that's really going to slam dunk this is the generation that grew up with  smartphones, grew up with the expectation that yes, there are always, there are always cameras on me.  Yes, I'm always sharing my life with total strangers. And those are going to be the people  who are going to be less worried about themselves going out in public with a device that everyone  knows is partially a camera. And they themselves are going to be less concerned in certain social  groups with going out with people who are also wearing cameras on their faces. Who knows? This  is a social experiment. So I love about technology. It is a social experiment, not just a commercial  and a technical one. It is ways that we learn about ourselves and who we are as a species.  I'm not just, it's time and time again, we ask questions that we would never have asked before  because we never had a need to ask before. Also, I think Apple might be starting to say, gosh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we should have, I know Metta is saying this. We didn't know that AI was going to become the next  big thing. And we shoot, we missed that one. I find it really hard not to be skeptical and just  think this is a terrible idea and it's not going to go anywhere. The one thing, the one technological  advance that would make me second guess myself is if it's really small and comfortable. I don't  think it's going to be, I think we're pretty sure it's going to be big and heavy, but that would be  the one thing. I just am very skeptical. Having bought every VR helmet, every nerd helmet available,  I just, I've seen zero progress. It's just, there's no reason to think that anybody wants this. Anybody  would buy it for any price. I don't care what content you get. Let's see what Apple Story is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's going to be the interesting thing is it's, I think it's entirely,  I'm more optimistic than you are Leo, but I think it's entirely possible that you watch that demo  and say, see, I told you there's nothing else here. I think it's possible. And I'm curious  to see whether they really advance the ball or not. Cause that's going to be, I think a huge question  here. Cause if it's more of the same and you've just look at it and say, oh, okay, it's just more  of the same. I think you're on much more solid ground. Well, and there's a risk that, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just watching the Microsoft build conference, of course, a developer conference, but there's a  risk that a lot of the developers who might consider VR content are saying, yeah, I'm going  to work on that AR thing. I just, that's where it's, that's where it's really happening.  I don't know any, what developer would say, oh yeah, VR now it's going to happen. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to have to really do some pitching. Yeah. But you know, if you've, if you've spent the  last 10 years of your life working in VR AR, you're not going to suddenly pivot to artificial  intelligence. I mean, you're, you've got the skills you need to build and also Apple's got,  Apple's got the checkbook open. If you've got, if you've been working in AI, that's where you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going, going as well. You're a graphics person, I guess. I mean, we have a friend, Gary, who's  been VR, VRing for more than a decade, I think two decades. Certainly that's the first time I saw a  VR helmet was at the SIGGRAPH in 1992. And he's excited about every one of these that comes out  and they never, he returned his Oculus Pro because it just can't break through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But there's a lot of, I mean, I don't know, I feel like there's a lot of technologies that we  talk about that takes some time to, you know, get from one side to the other. You know, and I think  that it is, and a lot of it has to do with just the money that's required. But I think that I  wonder if Apple will also take some guide from Epic. One of the biggest successes to moving  things forward for Epic has been the mega grants. You know, those have been like, it's not an  investment. It's just money, you know, and you can, if you're developing something new, that's  interesting, we're going to give you some money to do it. And it can be in the thousands, hundreds of  millions of dollars. And I think that Apple should hopefully look at that really closely and go,  well, we're going to give a bunch of developers, like if they announced that they're going to give  a bunch of developers grants, you know, to go out and experiment with it. I think that that gets a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lot of developers interested pretty quickly. Yeah. But that is, it is a good thing to be concerned  about because generative AI is something that is kind of right up Apple street in terms of what they  feel themselves to be a company, the sort of products that they like to do as a company.  When you talk about Armageddon, we'll put that aside. We'll focus on the idea of, you know,  here's how easy it is to write software. It's like we will that if you can just simply describe it,  our generative AI will swift. We have a new version of our developer kit that can,  that can co-pilot whatever it is you're trying to write. This is not for professionals because  professionals are going to want to fine tune things better, but this will walk you through  the development of Mac and iOS software. Or if you've got, if, if you need some help on,  if you took a bad picture, we've got onboard secure privacy or privacy oriented software  that will do stuff like what we're seeing in the, the new Photoshop beta that that's basically,  basically saying, yeah, basically our, my daughter brought a guy that he'd been,  she's been dating for two weeks to a big family wedding and now he's in all the wedding pictures  and now we need him gone. And basically, not just simply magic eraser, but it looks like nothing was  there to begin with all of this sort of stuff is empowering people, allowing them to do things  they couldn't do before to explore parts of their creativity that they didn't have the  technical skills or the technical training to be able to explore before. So if, so if Apple  products are not the sort of thing that lets you do that and you have for that, you have to  buy something else and use it with an Apple product that kind of makes Apple stuff lesser than  particularly compared to what windows will offer, particularly compared to what Android is going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  offer. I think that what would be interesting again is I don't know if you need generative AI  as much as you just need to have a really large library of things. So like for instance, if someone  puts a headset on and goes, give me a chair over here and I need this over here and I need that  over there, it doesn't need to build those from generative AI. It could have huge libraries of  stuff and maybe those are from IKEA, from Home Depot. And I could walk again, walk in and say,  I want this here, this here, this here. And start talking to it. Oh, no one, because no one,  it doesn't happen. How often would you do it? You wouldn't do it every day. You wouldn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it every week or month. You might do it once in a while. That's not a big market. You know,  there's one other thing that psychologically, and this is a really far out there though,  but I notice that people are watching less TV. They're listening to less podcasts, fewer podcasts.  Pandemic is over and we want to go outside. And it seems to me this might be the wrong time  to put out a product that fixes you in front of a screen and isolates you from the outside.  It may psychologically be just the absolute wrong time to release this product. I'm just throwing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it out there. Well, maybe, but the problem is that if you look at the success or not or lack  thereof for events, that's not been the case. People don't want to go to an event either.  They want to go for a walk. They don't want to go to offices. They don't want to go to events.  They don't want to, you know, like, so, but I'm just saying that I don't, maybe that's the case,  but there's also a lot of people that are, you know, and I think that, I do think that when you're  seeing drops in a lot of these things, you know, I am looking at my own behavior. I am, there's  other things that are coming up. So like a lot of magazines having lots of audio has filled a lot  of my time that used to be podcasts, you know, like, and so, you know, I listened to, I listened  to whatever it is, news over audio or whatever all the time, because it's, it's just popcorn of  audio that didn't exist a year ago or two years ago. At least I didn't know about it. And I find  myself, I almost never watch broadcast TV anymore. Like I watch a little bit of, I watch a little bit  of a show that I'm interested in Netflix or a show on Apple TV. And then almost, you know, a solid  60, 70% of my viewing is in YouTube. You know, and so I don't think you're the typical, I don't know.  I talk to a lot of people that talk about how much they're watching, because it's about things that  you're interested in. It's not that people are watching goofy things on YouTube. It is, I need  to know how to do this thing. Like my son built a PC by watching a video on YouTube. My, my daughter  plays three instruments, which he's only learned by watching YouTube. Like, like, literally she's  taking almost no lessons. I agree. I just don't think we're not, we're normal people, but I don't,  I mean, it just seems like in their world, I will say it is like the culture of you go to YouTube to  learn how to do things. Like it's just, you know, like that's how they, you know, absorb it in a way  that looks really painful to me. Like learning how to play a piece of music by stopping and  rewinding, stopping, rewinding, stopping, rewinding, stopping, rewinding to me is like a  little version of hell, but she figures out how to do it. And she learns whole songs like once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, we'll see. I'm just giving Apple an excuse for when it's a huge flop, which it's going  to be. I don't know. I wish I didn't. But, and I wish, and I hope I'm wrong actually, because I think,  you know, that, that sci-fi premise of a metaverse is very exciting. So much of it has to do with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hardware. I mean, I walked in, I, you know, 1998, I walked into a, a pretty gray room that was  probably 20 feet by 20 feet. There was a big umbilical cord and I put a headset on and I said,  give me a cube this big. And I put my hand out and it appeared and I was able to pull it and  turn it and everything else. I only had a couple of minutes in there and I was like, oh my gosh,  by 2005, I'm not going to have to use a mouse to model. I'm going to be able to do all this stuff  and everything else. And when you dig into it, it's just, the hardware is so hard to do that well.  And again, it comes down to, you know, frame rate and, and resolution are just very unforgiving  things. And people don't want to have something on their head that is low resolution or low  frame rate. You know, like that bothers them. Um, and they don't know it, but it just becomes  tiresome for them. And as that frame rate and resolution go up, it feels more and more natural  for them to be in those areas. And so I think that that's why I think that the, all the work  that I've done, I mean, I've done a lot of AR and VR work for companies. And, and, and it,  it really came down when they, when that resolution and frame rate started going up,  you started just wanting, you spent more and more time in the, in the environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's, that's just where, but AI comes in that, that kind of space too. When you think  about this device that has, that is almost certainly going to have cameras that are taking  in the environment around it, just by virtue of the fact that you're walking around your office  or walking around your house, it could be using, it can be using neural radiance fields to be  always building and updating a 3d model of your environment and inviting, and inviting other  people to share that environment with you. And we talked about this briefly last week where,  Google's, Google's super demo, super vaporware, super realistic 3d video chat booth technology  is about, you don't, you think that you're looking at video of somebody, but you're actually looking  at a 3d model of them that's being, that's being updated and redrawn from where perspective needs  to be at. So this is, this is where we've, one of the, one of the minor news stories this week is  about how Apple job listings have a lot of stuff for artificial intelligence researchers, artificial  people who are building practical things with AI. And yeah, that'd be nice if they updated Siri  with something more conversational. And that's one way they could leapfrog their competitors for the  first time since the product really came out. But if they have this holistic approach that we can  actually create these experiences that aren't just this weird total two super smooth, super shaven  version of Mark Zuckerberg, this fixed face and virtual reality land. It's just that incidentally,  I didn't, I didn't have to build this model of my living room. It just simply exists because  this is where I've been using this VR headset. I didn't have to create models of the people that  I'm talking to because these things just happen to exist because of the fact that they've been  using these VR headsets for so long. And then all of a sudden you're using iMessage and you think  that, Hey, great. I've got this great HD, virtual HD screen in front of me so I can actually be  engaged in what I'm doing, but also have this chat. But then there's a, then there's a software  update where there's a third icon where it's like, would you like to actually be in the,  have this person virtually in this shared space with you instead of in a square?  That's the sort of stuff that it's going to have to be a holistic approach of everything. And it's  not something that we're going to see until all of these Legos snap into place. I'll be really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  surprised if Memoji doesn't show itself in this. You know, like I feel like they've been building  up Memojis for a long time. Giant poop emoji right there on top of your desk. But the Memojis,  I mean, Apple is the only company so far in my opinion that has figured out a way to build  versions of ourselves that look cooler than ourselves because all the other ones look like  kind of a weird dorky version of every, I mean, every other AR head is like, wow, that looks stupid.  And I'm like, I can do a stupid version of myself and my Memoji, I'm like, I wouldn't mind if I  looked like Memoji. And so, sorry. Yeah. I use it a lot. I use it way too much. I send it to my  family and friends and like that's how I do it. Like instead of having a smile, a lot of times  it's my little head or whatever. And it's the thing that's on all my computers. I use it as an  as an emoji that looks like an emoji. I don't use it as much with video. If it was easier,  I mean, to be honest, if it was easier to export it, I would probably use it a lot more. Like it's  just that it's like this weird thing that's in clips or in messages. If they output it,  like for instance, if they had Memojis able to be exported and opened in motion or in Final Cut,  people would use it for all kinds of things. Maybe things they don't want it to be used for,  but that would be, they would definitely be more useful. So, but I think that I feel like when I  saw Memojis the first time, I was like, oh, they're getting that ready for the headset.  You know, like that was immediately, the moment I saw Memojis, I was like, that's what you replace  your head with. And you get everybody working on it for years and you get them comfortable with  the version that they have. And then when they see their friends, you know, with their, with that on  their head or whatever, they're going to be comfortable with it because they've been seeing  it for years. But I, that was, I mean, the moment I saw it, I was like, I know what that's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I guess I'm just a grumpy old man. We'll find out. I mean, I'm very much looking forward to June  5th and to see what it is. And I'm sure that I will be living in the reality distortion field  for at least a little bit. The buzz and all that. Let's take a break. When we come back,  your picks of the week, my friends. But first I want to give a little plug to our great club,  club twit. This is one of the things Lisa came up with a couple of years ago as advertising  started to dwindle during COVID. And now of course, with the debt ceiling default,  imminent advertisers are very, very nervous about everything. We decided,  our unique international macroeconomic headwind. Yes. We decided maybe we should let our audience  help support the network. And you have come forward with great gusto. And I'm so grateful  to our 7,000 club twit members. But I also note that's only about 1% of the total audience,  which means there's a lot of room for growth. So let me give you a pitch. Because if you're  hearing this, you're not a club twit member. I know that because club twit members hear no ads.  That's the first thing you get for your $7 a month. An ad free version of every show we do,  including this one. You also get shows we don't put out anywhere else. Our Hands on Macintosh  show with Micah Sargent or Paul Thuratt's Hands on Windows or the Untitled Linux show or Stacey's  Book Club or brand new. This is another great thing. We're able to bring back shows that in  the past have not self-supported. But the club can support like Home Theater Geeks with Scott  Wilkinson, which is now back in the fold. We're really thrilled to have that. And a whole lot  more. We also have special events. We have a great discord, which is full of wonderful people  talking about not just the shows that are going on, but everything in one's geek life. I'm sure,  in fact, I'm pretty sure we have an AR VR section. I'm sure that'll be heating up pretty soon  with all sorts of conversations. There's the book club, there's coding, there's fitness,  there's music and movies and pets and a whole lot more. If you're not yet a member of Club  Twit, seven bucks a month. You get all of that. I think it's a great deal. We have family plans.  We have yearly plans. We have corporate memberships as well. Just go to twit.tv slash club,  twit.tv slash club. And I would thank you in advance because we know you'll want to be a member  and support what we do here. It really helps. It makes a huge difference. We appreciate it.  Jason Snell, let's kick things off with your pick of the week, if you don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't mind at all. That's why I put a pick in the document is because I, in fact, I love it.  You have a pick. I do. Just out this week, Mime Stream version 1.0. I've been using this app.  I think it's been a pick before for a couple of years in beta. They kept adding features.  They kept saying, we will let you pay for it at some point. That time is now.  There's a special deal. It's a subscription thing. And here's what it is. It's a Gmail client  that is written entirely in Swift for Mac OS. So if you use Gmail and you would like to use  an email client that's made for it, not one that uses IMAP to kind of map mailboxes to tags and  stuff like that, but something that uses everything that's in the native Gmail API.  So you can set filters and vacation messages. You can do very quick searches. My favorite thing,  the reason that I keep using Gmail is of course, guess what? Google's good at search. I can search  all my messages from within Mime Stream. And it's just as fast as searching within Gmail,  except I'm in the context of a Mac app instead of in the context of a web browser window.  So since I switched to this a couple of years ago, I haven't looked back. It's a five person  team led by Neil Gervari, who used to be on the mail team and the notes team at Apple.  And he has decided to go out on his own and make a really good standalone Mac app. They say their  next step is going to be an iOS app, but obviously they've just launched the Mac app at 1.0.  But having used it for almost two years now, I can tell you it's really good if you love your Mac  and you love Mac native software and you use Gmail. It's got some really nice Mac stuff too,  like it supports focus filters. So like you can have multiple accounts and you can have them  be in different profiles where, you know, your business profile has your three work Gmail  accounts and your personal profile just as your personal, you can toggle between them.  You go into a focus mode, it'll automatically toggle between them. Just a lot of really nice  touches while also being a first class Gmail citizen, which differentiates it from all of  those email apps that are based on IMAP, which is like the standard, but is weird with Gmail.  And as a Gmail user, I just, I love it. I have not looked back. I'm so glad that it's out and that I  have signed up for my subscription to it because I wouldn't go back to any other client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Makes me jealous because I don't use Gmail and I would love, I would love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next on their list after iOS, they said probably support for IMAP. But the problem is it's the  exact opposite problem of most male clients in Gmail, which is you're trying to translate  one metaphor into another and they're not the same. IMAP and Gmail just aren't the same. So  you have to kind of fake it. So if they do it, they're going to have to do the other thing and  try to fake it the other direction. But iOS first for them. It's been beta for a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As Jason said, it is now official version 1.0 of Mime Stream free for 14 days, then $30 for your  first year, 50 for the second and subsequent years. MimeStream.com if you want to look or just look  on your Mac app store for Mime Stream. But again, Gmail only just to be clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just for Gmail. It is a, it is not, I got some fan mail actually yesterday where somebody wrote to me  and said, thank you for calling it a Gmail client and not an email client. It's very important.  It's not an email client. It is a Gmail client. It only works with Gmail, but if you're a Gmail  user, you should check it out. And a Mac user, you should check it out. Mr. Andy Anakho, your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pick of the week. My Pick of the Week is an old Mac game that has been rewritten to be new and work  with Apple Silicon. It's Glypho. It's called Glypho Vintage. You can go get it at the, it's on the,  on the Steam Gameplay. It's Joust. It's Joust, but it's been available. It was one of the earliest  really, really great games for the Mac. So yeah, it's a simple left button, right button to go left  and right. Press a space bar to flap. Other people are also writing ostriches or whatever it is.  And with lances, so long as your lance is higher than the lance of the person you're bumping into,  you win and you can scoop up an egg. If yours, if theirs is higher than yours, then you die.  And you keep repeating that until it's time for your Zoom meeting.  And, but this, but it's, it's exactly the sort of game that I like. I'm not, I don't have enough  time for like weeks and weeks and weeks of these beautiful, wonderful, immersive cinematic games.  I just want something to have some fun with for about 10 or 15 minutes at a time. And then maybe  get sick of like in two months for four bucks. It's a lot of entertainment for those of you who  are of a certain age, you will say, Oh my God, this is, I'm right, I'm right back in the computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lab in the high school and I'm being told, Hey, you're not supposed to be playing games in here.  You're supposed to be working on your term paper. And I'm saying, go, go to heck because I'm the  person who keeps these things maintained. If you want me to get that printer spooler working again,  you'll let me play another round of this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very specific, Andy.  Glyph of Vintage is on Steam so you can get it on your Steam.  Four damn dollars. Definitely worth it. It's really, it's really, damn dollars.  You know, when I first saw just the simple screen, I thought, Oh, this is a dark castle,  but it's, but it's, it's kind of dark castle meets joust. That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's that era where they had to make knockoffs of popular games because those  games weren't available on the Mac and they all look kind of like dark castle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but this is the joust one. Yeah. And you can play it on windows if you wish. Yeah.  Glyphor. Good pick. Thank you. Mr. Alex Lindsay. What's your pick this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I wasn't sure we were going to talk about it during the show, so I just waited until I had  like a couple of things to stick in there, but, but chat, chat GPT is now available on iOS with  its own app. Open AI has put it out. It's way better than going to the webpage. Like that's all  I can say. And if you have some other, you know, stupid version of it, the, that all these people  who are using the API and trying to put some front end on it and doing everything, you should just  get this one. It works. It's not, there's nothing special about it. It doesn't do anything more than  the webpage does. It's just way easier. Now you can open up and never ask you to log in. You can  just, you know, you know, I think you log in once or whatever, but then you're just using it. And  it's just so much fun. You know, like I, I, I don't, I'm not trying to write a research paper with it.  I'm just having it entertain me. I'm doing, doing crazy things like making a fortune cookies. And  I have my new obsession has been to ask it to do prompts for me. So I go, I'm looking, I said,  you are a designer and a prompt expert. I'm looking for a logo that is this, this, and this,  that, and I give it like a little thing, and then it creates this huge paragraph that I look at and  go, I don't think this is going to work in mid journey. And I tell it to do it for mid journey.  It writes this thing for mid journey that is really long. And I put it in a mid journey and  it looks great. And I'm just like, okay, the machines know how to talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, like exactly what the AI researchers were saying, what happens when we let these  AIs like build their own railroad track for them to follow. I'm already like waiting for the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the pipe that goes from chat GPT into mid journey. So I can say, Hey, chat GPT,  make me a, I need a graphic that looks like this and then have it just iterate and then hand me back  a couple hundred photos to look at. Like, what do you think of these? And then I select a couple,  and then it gives me a bunch more of those. And so I'm waiting for that all to get tied in. But  in the meantime, it is, it's really fun. You know, it is, again, I think the chat GPT is about as  smart as a book smart person. And, you know, it read a bunch of things and it is about as accurate  as someone who just read a bunch of things and didn't actually ever do it. So I find it to be,  there's a little bit of a pinch of salt that I put on everything that it gives me, but  it's not bad. Like it's, and it's, it's, it's, and it's a lot of fun. And I'm, I just made another,  a new OSH soup, the generated by the one that's on the app there. So, which is better than the  last one. And so they, which was good. Do you know, do you have to pay for chat GPT or I think I  logged in and I, I can use it and it'll give you the free version, but it might take time for it  to do it. I pay for it. So I, I think that it might when you log in and is it using version four

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  or is it using 3.5? You can switch to version four. So it has all those capabilities. Okay.  So it's just like using the web web interface, but it's just like using the web interface,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  except for that it's an app and it just runs a lot smoother. And you know, it, it,  the web interface was hard because occasionally it was going to ask you to log back in. It's like a  weird webpage and a little clunky. And this is just, it isn't different, but it doesn't cost  anything either. Like it's just a smoother, better interface for the one that you had before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is number one in productivity, which cracks me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to make you so productive and then not productive at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chat GPT from open AI. It's the official. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What were you saying? I was just, I haven't downloaded yet. Does it let you subscribe to  chat GPT for like through the app and is that, and is that a way for Apple to benefit from,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from AI? 30% exactly. Exactly. I don't know. I, I, I already had it. Yeah. I don't, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Discurious. Yeah. Not sure. Very good pick. All three of you be very aware. If, if, if it gives  you an quote wacky image prompt that looks like it might be a stack overflow buffer overflow exploit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for something. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Maybe, maybe take it back. Yeah, exactly. So I don't know if,  I think our title today is going to be Andy's wild thumb. I don't know if that will become a  good prompt or not, but I'm going to let you find out. I'll let you play with that. And if you are  watching the podcast at home or listening to the podcast at home, look at the album art.  If it's Andy's wild thumb, then you know that Alex succeeded.  Thank you, Alex Lindsay, office hours dot global is the place to go to see what's going on.  You're, you're doing all sorts of stuff now. This, this, this week is completely different than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  other weeks. Yeah. I mean, it just, it's, it's great. I mean, like, what is a subdivision surface?  I don't even subdivision surfaces is basically how most things get modeled. So if you see a 3d  model, most, most 3d models on the web or anywhere are getting start off with subdivision surfaces.  And so Alan Hawks, who's been an old friend of mine, I've known him for, you know, 15 years or  so, and he's, he does really high end, you know, surfacing and modeling and so on and so forth.  So he came in and talked about that yesterday. We had Cindy draws to on who does, she does  woodturning. This looks so cool. Like lane online woodturning and you know, Cindy, she's, she's in  our, she's in our community and she's just so great, but I hadn't seen her in her environment.  Like, like she, like I never seen it. And you're just like, she, she goes, she's like talking about  a little bit. And then she goes here, let me show you how I do this. And she's been doing this for  10 years or maybe eight years or whatever. So suddenly she starts just seamlessly jumping  between camera to camera to camera with her keyed over top of it and showing, you know, and, and  it's a, it's a incredible master's course on, on how to show people what you're teaching, right?  You know, and for her it's, it's woodturning, but it could be a lot of other things, but she's so good  at it. And it was really, really interesting to see her whole production. She's got like five or  six cameras and she's got a closeup while she shows you the wide and she's, you know, and she's,  you know, she's green screen. You can see it here. Like you can see her working, but you see the  closeup that's there and she's got it. And it's all seamless. Like she's got a stream deck and  she's got V-Mix and you know, it's not, you know, it's, it's a, it's really intense. And so it was  really interesting. And then we had, last week we had folks on from the NBC team talking about HDR.  So they were talking about like how to think about this and, and, you know, and, and so on  and so forth. So that was, you know, and we've just had, it's just, we're starting to get into  the zone where we just have one great, you know, one great second hour after another. So it's a lot

And I did a live  stream earlier today, so there's like a half hour or you can watch me edit something in Final Cut Pro  on the iPad where you can see the screen and you can also see my hands on the screen  so that you can...
